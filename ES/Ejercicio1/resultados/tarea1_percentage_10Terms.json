   "selftext": "Anyone dealt with this?  My left hip has been hurting progressively since September. I thought I slept on it wrong, then I thought it was just dehydration. \n\nWell sober HC is really proud of his daughter because she's taken interest in wrestling and she asked me to get on the floor and teach her some of the stances and take downs. And I couldn't. \n\nI went to the orthopedic doctor today and through xrays he thinks I have avascular necrosis and now I'm getting and MRI Wednesday. \n\nThe nurse asked how I'd number my pain and (I always do this dumb shit) I said \"at it's worst 6 maybe 7 and a half?\n\nOnce the doctor saw the Xrays he said \"7 and a half?!\" That's at least a 9. Then I explained I knew pain tolerance was different for people and I didn't want to come across as a pussy. \n\nWell just to make sure he's right I have an MRI Wednesday morning. I hate these doctor appointments because I'm so scared of losing my job. \n\nHe told me the two options we would probably have would be for him to open up my hip and then drill into the head of my femur in hopes of sparking blood flow. \n\nThe other option is a hip replacement. Which I immediately said no too. I'm 32 for fucks sake. \n\nI just didn't know if anyone has been through something similar?  When I Google it I see that it's genetic and caused by alcoholism. So there's two chips on my bingo board. \n\nI dunno. He made it seem like it was a very under researched issue and that it could lead to amputation years and years from now. \n\nMy xray was really telling my right hip looked beautiful. My left hip looked like the head of my femur had turned into a saw blade.",

   "selftext": "29/F with mother 55 looking for some perspective \n\nHi reddit. First time poster in this sub. As the title says I\u2019m really looking for some perspective on my situation and how to deal / move forward in a positive way. \n\nIn a nutshell, both my parents suffered from alcoholism. My parents divorced at 6 and both remarried. Their spouses are a whole other issue, not really relevant. As a child I often hid the extent of drinking of one parent to the other in fear that I wouldn\u2019t be able to see them. At 15 I decided I did not want to pursue a relationship with my father due to his drinking (he was a violent drunk and often threatened to kill me). We did not speak for many years until he was in the hospital near death. We reconnected for 2 months until he passed on, due to liver failure. I was 19 at the time. It was difficult but I\u2019ve worked through these issues with therapy. \n\nMy mother, however, has been an on-going challenge. She struggles with alcohol addiction but also pharmaceutical\u2019s. I can\u2019t tell you exactly what but I know it\u2019s drug base simply because we she can go sober to comatose fucked up in under 30 minutes. \n\nAnyway, this has been a recurring problem throughout my life and a little over a year ago I decided to move to a different province and start over (more personal than family related). It went well but had its own struggles. I was out of work for a long time and barely surviving. \n\nsince the new year I\u2019ve been doing really well. Working multiple jobs to pay bills, basically doing what I need to do to survive. It\u2019s been hard but a detrimental learning experience in my life. I\u2019ve really come to realize how ungrateful I\u2019ve been for the life I\u2019ve had and not being able to even feed myself I l have a new appreciation for life. I\u2019m still not where I want to be but I have goals and I\u2019m always working towards them, etc. \n\nOnce I moved away my mother and I fought constantly. Generally about things that happened in the past that I didn\u2019t think were necessary to argue about when I lived a 2 day drive away. We took our space and slowly began to rebuild. Recently, I finally felt like I had a mother again. \n\nHowever, without fail, a few weeks into rekindling our relationship it reverts back to the way things used to be. For example, my mom will often call me up to complain about whatever hardship she\u2019s going through. Her financial situation is also poor and I completely understand how hard it is; however, sometimes I feel like our conversations our a battle between whose life is more shitty and I can\u2019t get over how awful that is. I don\u2019t want bad for her or for me. Sometimes I just want to talk to my mom and vent because she\u2019s my mom and I need her. I hate feeling like I can\u2019t do that. \n\nRecently, she asked if I was still wanting to keep all the belongings I left at her house. I said \u2018no, it\u2019s been over a year I\u2019m not attached anymore. There\u2019s a few sentimental things I want but besides that, try and sell it and keep the money.\u2019 During searching through my things she came across a childhood journal and felt compelled to read it. The part she read spoke about me, around 8 years old, lying to her about the extent of my fathers drinking. I lied to her because I was worried she wouldn\u2019t let me see him. Although this is true, it\u2019s been 20 years I don\u2019t feel the need to discuss it. She kept pressing and pressing. Eventually I told her point blank: this was 20 years ago, it was my private thoughts and it\u2019s not up for discussion. She apologized for being such a \u2018loser\u2019 and I reiterated that I never said that nor do I think that, but those are my private thoughts and I would never invade her privacy like that. We ended up getting into an argument over something unrelated a week later and now we are no longer speaking. \n\nOver the years I\u2019ve gone to many therapy groups based around codependency. I fully understand my role in her life and how I\u2019ve contributed to her illness by being a crutch. However, now at 30, living 5000km away from each other I still can\u2019t seem to break the cycle. If this happened a year ago I would have completely lashed out and caused a huge fight. I decided to handle it calmly which I think was a good first step for me. That being said, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s used to that type of reaction and tried to start a fight a week later over something else. \n\nI love my mother very much. Now as an adult I really appreciate all the sacrifices she made for me as a child. I moved away to break this cycle but it just keeps following regardless of what I do. I don\u2019t want to change her. I\u2019ve accepted her drinking as a reality I can\u2019t blame myself for or constantly worry about. I just want to have a healthy relationship with her and I\u2019m so lost on where to start. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions or has been through something similar? At a loss right now and just looking for suggestions. \n\nThanks! \n\n",

Any advice would be great. It just sucks knowing you are better than this and yet it's so hard to combat .lately I write notes to myself every night before I go to bed  try to discourage my self from drinking.  In my notes I try to self motivate and pray to the lord, jesus christ that I am better than this. Any advice or words of encouragement  would be very helpful as its hard to stop. I'm in my late 20's, trying to be the best I can be.but alcohol seems to get in my way. My ancestry is known to be prevalent to alcoholism but I want to the buck to stop here. I'ts time to stop. Most importantly  I want my parents to see me succeed as they were the best parents ever and I feel I have let them down. Any wise words of wisdom are welcomed, be it negative or positive.

She was a stay home mom and now that my children are in their 20's she ran the house.  We have 2 dual bank accounts.  She did not drain either one at all however she ran up several credit cards.  My plan was to have her sign an agreement to remove her name from both bank accounts.  I dont want to close them because so many bills  are paid from the accounts I dont want to take a chance of some of them not getting paid etc.  I plan on taking all her credit cards away.  How do I supply her with money.  She does all the food shopping, house errands etc.  I also cant just give her a gift card specifically to grocery stores because they sell wine, her drink of choice.  Any ideas greatly appreciated.",

   "selftext": "My grandmother died a few days ago, i've been lamenting on the fact that perhaps I could have visited her had I not been in a shit relationship that ruined my finances and allowed me to be in debt and depressed, and also an alcoholic. She lives in another province and plane tickets are expensive. My father, uncle and sister were all there for my Granddad when she passed. The last time I visited them I was hungover every day and I was not invested in appreciating my time with them.\n\nThis of course has been a fruitless endeavor that is self absorbed and ridiculous in hindsight, but in my sadness, I was angry. I became fixated on everything negative about the man I loved and hated for years. I came across  a recorded conversation I had with my ex during the most abusive point in our relationship.\n\nIn haste, I revisited it and realized how fucked he was, and how fucked I had become.\n\nThe iPhone recording of my ex and I, was one I took a night in a back alley when I was completely hammered at the bar he worked at. It was very near the end of our relationship; we were talking about how I felt he was drowning from the anxiety of his job that did not pay him enough nor respect him enough. He got in trouble for having anger issues and reprimanding the front of house staff (he was kitchen manager) and I was attempting to reopen the \u201cgo get counselling\u201d discussion which obviously never works when you\u2019re wasted.\n\nThis is why I never want to get into alcoholism again, hearing me slur and cuss just as much as he was makes me repulsed. This is verbatim what is recorded on my app:\n\nHim: *random mumbling* \u201c\u2026if somebody pisses me off and doesn\u2019t you know \u2013 treat me the way you know I\u2019m not \u2013 like \u2013 like I should be treated; \u2018look at me, I\u2019m a fucking psychopath!\u2019\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cYou\u2019re not a psychopath \u2013 \u201d\n\nHim: \u201cShut your fucking mouth.\u201d\n\nSilence for five seconds.\n\nHim: \u201cSo you\u2019re the person that I\u2019m talking about - *high pitch imitative voice* - \u2018OH you\u2019re not a psychopath\u2019 \u2013 shut up.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cYou\u2019re being very\u2026crazy right now.\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cWell you just shut your fucking mouth, you don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI\u2019m not \u2013 \u201d\n\nHim: \u201cYou know what? You\u2019re never been there before, you have never understood \u2013 someone who has been like \u2013 you know what? This is \nit? This is my life! This is the strength in my life.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201c*I* don\u2019t understand? I\u2019ve been like \u2013 I\u2019ve been around you for almost seven fucking years.\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cYou\u2019re right! I\u2019ve given you everything you\u2019ve asked for. You know what? I have.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cNo! No you fucking haven\u2019t. You\u2019ve not given me what I asked for. That\u2019s why our relationship is fucking failed!\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cGOODBYE. You can leave then! Perfect! We\u2019re on the same page!\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI\u2019m not trying to tell you that! I\u2019m trying to say \u2013\u201c\n\nHim: *incoherent mumbling*\n\nMe: \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to help you and you\u2019re being unbearable.\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cI don\u2019t need help.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cYes you do!\u201d\n\nHim: *\u201cReally?\u201d*\n\nMe: \u201cYou need someone to help you! Someone qualified, who isn't me.\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cI hate you! FUCK YOU. GOOD. BYE.\u201d\n\nThe recording ends with ten second of silence. This isn't nearly even as bad as our arguments got. I remember that night he was so drunk he could not stand and I blacked out after walking away form him and having him follow me three blocks.\n\n",

   "selftext": "I'm not sure where this exactly belongs, so I'll be posting it to a few subs.\n\nI need some help sorting through my feelings about my mom (doesn't everyone?). Growing up, my mom was awesome. She made all my Halloween costumes, homeschooled me (well, I might add), fostered my huge love of reading and the arts. She was funny, beautiful, kind, and very strong in her faith. She had/has depression but she was open about it and took medication. She sacrificed a lot for my siblings and I. She wasn't perfect by any stretch, we still had our normal mom-daughter spats but, I really respected and looked up to her.\n\nBut everything changed when my dad left and they got divorced when I was 15. She turned into the perpetual victim and what was once well-managed depression became full blown alcoholism. She went to work and worked hard but was not present for my younger sibling or me. Instead she got drunk every night and many nights, I had to go out looking for her because she didn't come home. She became very promiscuous, which after a fairly strict Christian upbringing, was a complete 180 from what I was taught.\nBeing extremely type-A, I picked up a lot of slack, especially with my brand new license. I took my sibling to all their various activities, packed lunches, bought presents. I was so mad at my dad for leaving that I went no contact for about five years, and truthfully, he was having his own breakdown and I really couldn't handle it.\nI see now that my behavior really enabled her, but at the time it was all I could do to keep from losing it. I developed anxiety disorder and started having severe panic attacks. I was running around trying to be mom, while also trying to go to school, work part time, and still be a normal teenager. I was trying so hard to keep everything together and keep up appearances.\n\nEverything came to a head when I came back from a mission trip Spring Break of my Sophomore year, and the whispering at school about my family was too much to ignore. I was the last to find out about an incident that happened with my mom and sibling while I was gone. It's too identifiable so I won't go into detail but lets just say she completely embarrassed me in front of my entire peer group. I was (am) a tight-ass, trying so hard to project an image of perfection and kids were making jokes about my mom in class.\n\nAfter all this, and her continued drinking, I lost all respect I had for my mom. It's like she died when my dad left and the person who remained was not my mother. I was so angry with her and as soon as I graduated, I left for college and didn't look back. She stayed in home town until my younger sibling graduated a couple years later then basically dropped younger sibling and left the country.\n\nNow she lives several states away and I end up seeing her about once a year. Her behavior hasn't really changed, although she tries to maintain it has. She tells me she doesn't really drink any more, but all her social media is photos of her at bars in skimpy costumes. I'm still so embarrassed by her behavior that it makes me act completely crazy when she comes around. After the last time she was here, I decided that I cannot have her visit any more and will tell her as much when she tries to visit this year.\n\nI barely talk to her now and it still makes me feel so guilty. I'm constantly second guessing my reaction to her. Like, compared to other parents on the RBN sub or JustNoFamily, she really isn't that bad. Am I being too harsh? Should I figure out how to just accept her as is? We don't have anything in common and I get really embarrassed and nervous when she talks because she has no filter any more. I can't tell her about the good things going on in my life because she seems to turn it around to be a pity-party for herself, while still maintaining that she \"loves her life\" and \"things are going soooooo great!\"\n\nFor my mental health, I do not follow her on social media and I have VVVLC, but that fact alone still leaves me feeling incredibly guilty, because if my child didn't talk to me, I would be devastated.\n\nI'm just looking for some advice on how to handle her and if I'm doing okay. I think if she had been a shitty mom the whole time, this would be a lot easier, but somehow I can't let go of the extremely fond memories I have of her growing up.\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you thank you so much for reading!",

   "selftext": "Hi guys, hope you are all having a great night slash day wherever you are. So my pregnant bpd girlfriend has ended our relationship again. We have been together over a year and I have been steadfast and loved her through her alcoholism and constant push pull , she is the most wonderful person I have met just has some issues like every one else. We each have kids from previous relationships and are family has blended together really well all the kids are excited about their new sister . So we found out she was pregnant a few months ago and with the hormones she has completely changed and basically hates me or so it seems. She kicks me out about once a week, for reasons like I comforted her wrong , another time I asked her if she was upset about something just minor things that get blown way up. Sunday morning we woke up and everything was great we laid in bed and cuddled and talked till about nine. My 11 year old who I only get one weekend a month because of distance was here for the weekend . My girlfriend decided to organize our room and I took her daughter and mine out to caribou and when we returned out of nowhere she flipped and started going off about how I never made my kids eat vegetables before I met her and now there is different rules for her kids and mine about eating vegetables. My kids eat the same vegetables at dinner that hers does so I don\u2019t understand but anyways it upset me that she seems to flip when I get my daughter, my daughter loves her and is a great kid. So after that mess I have to run my daughter home to her moms and when I get back home with my seven year old it was about ten at night. He shares a room with her five year old . I sent my son to bed right away , thirty seconds later her son comes out bawling saying my son says they can\u2019t watch YouTube videos in bed . That\u2019s a rule that my girlfriend and I implemented, my son wasn\u2019t rude at all just following rules. My girlfriend lost it saying that my kids don\u2019t get punished for anything and have no rules which is not true. She says she doesn\u2019t want to do this anymore and ends the relationship again. I am mentally exhausted and I have full custody of my seven year old so when I get kicked out at 11at night my son comes with. After she quit drinking I prayed that this would stop but has gotten worse since being pregnant, I clean , I pay the bills , I drive both of our kids to school and their activities but she still says I don\u2019t do anything that I promised. Sorry getting a little long winded , so as of Sunday she told me to only contact her about the baby. I am super hurt and have not responded to any of her texts or calls because of my anxiety and all the texts have been devaluing me and trying to instigate a reaction. Like I said she is wonderful but since being pregnant can\u2019t stand me. Any advice on how I could handle her better ? The consequences of whatever is going on her head have a huge affect on a lot of people\u2019s lives and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m strong enough to hang on anymore it\u2019s messing with my son.  Sorry it was so long and thanks guys for any advice . I have a lot of respect for you  ",

   "selftext": "Hi guys, \n\nIn two days, I'll be 22 years old. I've decided I'm using that \\(somewhat unimportant\\) milestone to mark my shift into an abstinent lifestyle. My last drink was five days ago, and I made a total fool of myself. Blacked out, annoyed my friends, it wasn't pretty. And this has happened more times than I can count. \n\nI started drinking when I was 17, and directly from the beginning I had problematic tendencies when drinking. I kept telling myself I'm not an alcoholic, and maybe I'm actually not one, but labels don't matter, it's the way one behaves and how it affects one's life. I don't think I'm addicted to alcohol. For me, it is truly not difficult to stay sober. I've gone to bars before with friends and had no problem resisting the temptation to drink; knowing I had to drive home later. All no issue whatsoever. My problem? Moderation! I can't just have one or two drinks like most people. The moment I get started, I just want more and more without really noticing  \\(or caring\\) at what point enough is enough. This has led to me having more than my fair share of embarrassing memories while out with friends, and I'm tired of it. I can't tolerate it anymore. Every time I start drinking, there's about a 30&amp;#37; chance that I'll regret it the next day. Then when you consider drinking about once per week, that's another drunken embarrassment every month. All of my friends have their rare occassions of accidentally going a little too far and getting a little too drunk, but it happens to me signficantly more often than anyone else I know. \n\nUntil now, I've always made excuses for myself, so as to not hate myself more than I already do. Maybe I drink too much to drown out the sadness and self hatred caused by my Depression? Maybe I drink too much because I have Aspergers' Syndrome \\(a form of high\\-functioning autism\\) and I don't have the social capacity to know when enough is enough? Maybe I'm just addicted to alcohol and haven't realized it? Maybe my extensive family history of alcoholism has doomed me genetically to excessive drinking?....... All of these might be right or none of them, it's honestly anyone's guess. But the important part isn't what's causing this issue, but rather how I react to it. And I'm afraid the only logical thing to do is to swear off alcohol until further notice, but probably forever. The security is knowing that I always have complete control over my behavior is well worth sacrificing a little bit of fun when going out with friends. \n\nTo a certain extent I feel a bit sorry for myself that I can't just have a casual drink now and then like most people do; it's certainly a nice way to liven up a party or loosen up social inhibitions. But on the other hand I feel very lucky that making this decision to be abstinent is a relatively easy one that does not involve any pain or anxiety in my day to day life, as it does for so many members of this sub, who struggle day to day to stay sober; they have my deepest sympathy and respect. \n\nI don't know exactly what my intentions were in writing this, I guess I just wanted to tell someone about my decision. I haven't told my friends yet and I'm interested to see how they will react. ",

   "selftext": "I've known and loved this man for 17 years although we never dated we recently started dating.  He has depression and anxiety which is been ongoing and though I knew he drank I realize now he has a problem with alcohol. Sometimes it seems like he knows he does other times he's in complete denial.  He's been in and out of a hospital inpatient program for suicide emotional stuff about four times since November.   As soon as he gets out though he always goes back to drinking.   Never gone to rehab or median turning thing like that.  I've told him that I can't be with him if he keeps drinking like this there's been times when he's passed out he says he's not drinking and then he is just all the usual Behavior common in alcoholism.  I really care a lot for him I really don't know what to do anymore.  I've broken up a couple times with him but always go back with him because I miss him and worry about him and honestly we have a wonderful sexual chemistry he's supportive and always has the right things to me it's never abusive to me although his behavior isn't good for any relationship I know.  I told him recently that I can't do this with him anymore if he doesn't get help and he took it as me breaking up with him again now I want to see him cuz I miss him and I know that's kind of selfish.  I'm looking for any advice about what to do if I should see him or not we only see each other a couple times a week at most and I'm debating whether or not to see him this week or just cut it off which is very hard for me to do because of my own needs.  I'm trying to be supportive but not enabling and not have a codependent relationship where I just worry about him and his drama but it does overtake things. Then I wonder if we are more serious inside each other more maybe it would help I really don't know what to do at this point any advice would be appreciated.",

I didn\u2019t want to let go of that last hope for a relationship with alcohol. Holding that hope is sort of like sizing up your boyfriend who has just cheated on you with your best friend, burned your house down and killed your cat and weakly saying, \u201cWell...we\u2019ll take a break I guess...for a while....\u201d I am seeing how diseased that is, and how it set me up to white-knuckle it through sobriety and view not drinking as deprivation instead of freedom and hope. I really feel that book This Naked Mind helped a lot so thanks to whoever recommended it to me recently. It illuminated a way of thinking that makes so much sense to me and reversed the deprivation aspect. Now I feel sorry for people who drink like I did. I don\u2019t want it at all. If points come up in the future when I do have a momentary craving I will reread some of the hardest hitting passages.\n\nThe withdrawal anxiety from my bender on Saturday is finally gone. I truly never want or need to experience that again. I\u2019m exercising, eating well (lots of leafy greens and fruits) but giving myself treats when I want them, getting much better sleep again, and taking supplements. DHA, vitamin D, reishi mushroom and Lion\u2019s Mane to try to help normalize my brain again. Oh and matcha tea, breathing exercises, and cold showers (Wim Hof method.) I am looking forward to getting started with actually realizing the potential that was locked inside me all these years while only the alcoholism got to express itself. \n\nSo yeah this past weekend was a harsh setback and it hurt but I landed in a better place, I think, and a lot of the good work I did before the slip-up in terms of getting my life together (meaning the little things like cleaning and organizing, getting my car serviced, having my teeth cleaned, playing board games with my kids, etc that don\u2019t happen when your major agenda in life is getting wasted and passing out) is all still in place. \n\n",

   "selftext": "On the drive to the prison, my buddy spent some time unloading.  In a way it was a meeting before the meeting, and he needed it.\n\nA brief explanation -to my mind a meeting does not have to take place in a church basement.  It can be two alcoholics connecting in the bread aisle of the supermarket, or at a coffee shop.  It can last a couple of minutes, or, as in this case, the forty five minutes it took to drive to our destination. His wife is very sick, she is a terrible patient, she provokes him, he regrets his outbursts...\n\nIn science fiction movies one often transports to another universe by passing through something like a giant soap bubble.  Not so in prison, it's stop, show ID, names recorded on clipboard and notebook, gates open and close - going through metal detectors in an area called the port sally, getting our get out of jail free cards and surrendering our keys and outside ID, more gates, and then a short ride in a battered van to the building where the 'programs' are held.\n\nAnd then - like the science fiction movie - poof we're in the alternate universe.  With people just like ourselves...\n\nThe leader last night picked a reading from a staple book in AA called Living Sober (pdf versions can be found online)  - He chose the chapter \"Easy Does It\" which goes directly against the alcoholic super power of \"I gotta get all this done immediately, and perfectly\".\n\nFrom the reading *\"The slogan \"Easy Does If is one way we  AA's remind each other that many of us have tendencies at times to overdo things, to rush heedlessly along, impatient with anything that slows us down. We find it hard to relax and savor life.\"* \n\nThis morphed into a topic of letting ourselves get bent out of shape when someone or something gets in the way of doing what we want to do.  (this happens a lot in prison)  someone else is on the phone - or a correction officer decides this is the time to enforce ALL the rules.  Space is rented in heads, molehills become mountains with international expeditions wearing oxygen tanks as they struggle upwards.... \n\npreachybit/ **there is so much more to recovery than not drinking - though that is of course the required starting point. Our thinking - our whole system of coping - is thrown into disarray. We no longer need a Bureau of Lies and Evasion in our heads** (the source of some of our 'superpowers') - and that releases a lot of energy which is not always put to good use /preachybit\n\nOne man shared on how he'd avoided drama this week by simply not responding to someone who was clearly looking to start something - over nothing.  \"I used to live for such moments, not that I needed an excuse to get into an argument, but if one came along I sure would run with it.\"   Easy Does it at work.\n\nTowards the end of the chapter it says *\"When we do find ourselves up-tight and even frantic, we can ask ourselves occasionally, \"Am I really that indispensable?\" or \"Is this hurry really necessary?\" What a relief to find the honest answer is frequently no!\" and ... \"How much does it really matter?\" is a very good question.\"* \n\nPreachybit2/ my warped, damaged, leaky self esteem was at the core of my alcoholism - and my knee jerk response was often do inflate it making my 'missions' far more important and urgent than they had to be - making me and those I was bumping against unhappy or angry.  Today Easy Does It - helps me a lot./preachybit2\n\nThere was less need for yet another \"meeting\" on the ride home  but as my friend was getting out of my car and into his truck, I called out \"Take care or yourself too, my friend.\"  He said he was going to go fishing tomorrow.\n\n",

   "selftext": "Thank you for reading this in advance and sorry for the long text ahead.  I just need to vent.  I wasn't sure who to talk to so i found this subreddit. My dad's been an alcoholic my entire 31 years of life.  He'll be 59 years old tomorrow.  I now live in FL, my dad is living in my home state of WI.  His alcoholism has gotten to the point where he is on the verge of death and I don't know what to do.  I'm very scared and worried.\n\nHe wont listen to me.  My ex girlfriends dad had nowhere to stay, so my dad let him crash at his house.  My ex's dad had to leave because the house smelled bad of feces/urine and he couldn't stand it, he'd rather be homeless than live with him. \n\nMy ex told me that her dad told her that my dad... Drinks, sleeps for a few hours, drinks, sleeps for a few hours, drinks...etc. I was also told that he looks like he \"weighs 80 pounds, if that\", urinates and has bowel movements in his clothes, he doesn't eat for a week, he hasn't showered in months, my dog of 14 years old+ is also living with my dad and the dog is puicking/pooping/peeing all over the house and is eating her own poop.  Was also told he uses a bucket to pee, and has a rash/bumps all over his body (probably from not showering)\n\nI called my dad early this morning and we talked for 17 minutes. He just woke up so he was more towards the sober side, but still drunk.  He told me that he's fine and not to worry. He said he's 140 pounds (very doubtful) and that he had a half a sub to eat yesterday and 2 fish sandwhiches and a big mac the day before. He said that a week ago he didn't eat at all because he wasn't hungry. He did tell me that his legs are week and he hasn't done laundry in a long time because hes to weak to walk downstairs to do laundry.  He also said that when he drinks he doesn't care if he pees himself, or doesn't care if the dog goes to the bathroom all over the house.  He said the house does stink.  He said he has cream for the rash and not to worry.  I told him \"dad you're going to die if you don't care of yourself\" he said he doesn't care, everyone dies.\n\nBut I am worried.  Of course, he is my father!  He's been in rehab a few times years ago and we even had him committed in the past one time.  He was sober for a few months, then started right back up again.  At this point, i don't know if that'd help him.  He's literally drinking himself to death.  If he quits drinking it'll kill him because he's so dependent on it, and if he continues to drink it'll kill him.  \n\nI don't know what to do.  I told him he needs to go to the doctor, he said no.  Told him he needed to think about put my dog down because shes obviously getting sick/old age...he said no that's cruel.  My dad told me in the past that once the dog dies, he will kill himself.  He's tried to kill himself in the past, mostly just saying he was for attention, but one time he actually cut his wrists (with a dull blade and just needed a few stitches)\n\nHe is obviously very sick.  I messaged his two sisters and told them about what's been going on and asked if they could go check on him. I  Hoping for a reply that they will do so. I really can't afford to fly up there just to get an ''i'm fine, don't worry\".  I can't afford it and my work is short staffed and i'd probably be fired if i go. I do not want to believe that hes down to 80lbs, if that's the case, he will be dead any day.  I was thinking about calling the cops for a well being check, but i don't know if they'd do anything.  Sure maybe they'll lock him up on a 72hour hold at the hospitals' psych ward, MAYBE, but probably not.  I've called the police MANY times on him when i was living at home and they really didn't do anything.  He's been to detox, gets out and drinks.  He was sober for a few months in the middle of last year, did it on his own, but now is back at it and it's worse than its ever been.  I didn't know it was this bad until i got the message from my ex last night.\n\nSorry for the long text, and thank you for reading.  I'm scared.  I'm worried...its making me depressed.  I hope my aunt's will go over there and check up on him.  He's going to die if he doesn't get help.  He's all i have left.\n\n\n *Edit-Neither one of his sisters will help/check on him...the want nothing to do with him.",

We have known for some time that he had a drinking problem but he had it under \"control\".  Over the past 8\\-10 months, things have escalated significantly.  In January, we brought our young son over to his family's home for a playdate in the late morning.   He was intoxicated when we arrived and claimed to have been grocery shopping; he shot a gun that we didn't know he even had right next to my husband's ear, blowing the ear drum; he then attempted to go sledding with the kids and hurt himself pretty badly \\- cut face, bruising; then, he passed out at the kitchen table at 2 PM.    We had made an offer to his wife to bring her somewhere the following day, to which she responded \"I can't trust him here with the kids alone\".  That was our first real sign that his drinking had escalated. \n\nFast forward to March.

He is refusing any treatment.\n\nWhat options do we have to help him so that he doesn't end up hurting or killing himself?  Can we get him involuntarily committed?  Is the noose sufficient evidence of threatening self harm? \n\nPlease help.  We honestly do not know what to do.  ",

In particular, all examples I see tend to involve significantly longer binging/higher consumption than mine, which makes it hard to assess. \n\nHere's my situation: 28yo, 130lbs, 10+ drinks on Friday &amp; Saturday nights type, have been for 10 years, no withdrawal issues ever (even on slightly longer binges), thought blacking out pretty much completely is very common, which is anecdotally not normal apparently. \n\nRecently had a bad 2-week binge after a breakup, at well over 10+ drinks per day for 14 days in a row, and I had withdrawal symptoms for the first time (seemingly in the moderate area from what I've read: really bad insomnia, hands shaking, night sweats, tons of \"vivid nightmares while half asleep\" bordering on hallucination, very foggy/\"permadrunk\" feeling during the day, irregular heartbeat), but took a few weeks off drinking and got back to normal. Actually saw a doctor because I started googling these symptoms and got scared of DTs, but he sent me home untreated saying things like \"the guys I get here I'm actually worried about are shaking 10x more violently than you are\". He also said \"but by my diagnosis, you definitely are an alcoholic\", which is kind of rattling.\n\nLast weekend, after the few weeks off to feel back to normal, did a typical 10+ drinks on Friday/Saturday, expecting Sunday to be totally normal, but I'm seemingly having withdrawal symptoms again starting Sunday and still going on now (full nights of insomnia in particular, a touch of the vivid nightmares/hallucination and irregular heartbeat type of stuff). Just for more perspective, I've been a fall-asleep-in-10-seconds person my entire life, so insomnia is extremely odd for me, especially this severe. \n\nSo, is this an example of kindling? I don't know how bad this kind of situation is: is total abstinence at this point a knee-jerk overreaction, or is continuing to use my body to test this out actually dangerous? If the answer is \"not likely kindling, but cut back on 10+ drinks and blacking out\" that's great. \n\nLike I said, I'm also open to the possibility I'm saying a lot of dumb things, so just looking for any info or related situation you can help me with..",

   "selftext": "Something I have been pondering for a while: where is the line between liking alcohol, and alcoholism? Do I drink because I like alcohol and choose to drink it, or am I addicted and justifying what I do?\n\nI've always liked strong liquor, and never understood why some people think neat liquor is too strong to drink. When it comes to alcoholic beverages, I've always preferred drinks that are over 50% in alcohol content. For me it's always been about the taste and the warm glowing sensation it causes.\n\nI used to drink 2 glasses on the majority of days, at night before going to bed. And I don't mean just gulping down 2 glasses, but sitting back with a book or something on tv, sipping from my glass at the end of a busy day. Never more than 2 glasses.\n\nI've always been careful not to get drunk, simply because I hate being drunk. Sure, it's happened a couple of times in my adult years, such as on newyears eve. Even then, I was legally drunk but still able to talk, walk, and know what I am doing.\n\nSince I've always been aware that logically, there has to be a line where a controlled habit becomes an addiction, and because of that I regularly decided in a pseudo random manner to not drink until the end of whatever month it happened to be, which meant I would not drink anything for a period that could be between 1 to 4 weeks. This was just to prove to myself that I was not having a problem.\n\nIn my inexperienced opinion, maintaining control is what makes the difference. I'm curious to know if that matches what people here think.\n\nBtw, I've quit alcohol altogether for about a month now. Not because I don't like it anymore, but because I have a medical issue for which I need to lose weight, and alcohol is one of the things I scrapped from my day, together with sugary snacks and other junk.\n\nI didn't think quitting would have any effect at all because it was not difficult, but one surprising thing I noticed is that now I dream more often, more clearly. And it takes me less time to go from grumpy to awake.",

   "selftext": "I am an adult woman and I learned about 5 years ago that my dad had an alcohol addiction. He has a lot of anxiety, and every once in a while he has crises where he drinks a lot of alcohol \\(he hides it\\). Sometimes the crises are triggered by social events where he believes he has to drink alcohol to belong with the crowd.\n\nI had witnessed some crises and I usually don't do anything until my dad melts down in front of us \\(usually my mom, my brothers and me\\) and we then have a very long conversation about his addiction and his anxiety.\n\nHe is in the middle of one crises. My brother and his girlfriend were there earlier this week and my dad melted down \\(he had been drinking again for about two weeks\\). We had a very long conversation in which my brother told my dad that he was going to change his role, that he was going to coach my dad as of now. The thing is, my brother lives quite far away. I currently live with my parents again due to an injury. After the big conversation I told my dad that I would quit Coca\\-Cola while he quits alcohol. I made up a chart in which we have to make a cross every day we're not drinking.\n\nWell today my dad said he could make a cross. So I told him he would be able to do that tomorrow, and I decided I would be the coach.\n\nI started by putting tape on the door to the backroom where the alcohol is stored. My mom had thrown out all the hard liquor but my dad started drinking wine. I have a mind to throw out the wine but I'll pitch the idea to my mom first \\(and to my dad when he's out of his crisis\\). I told my dad he wasn't allowed there, and that if he needed something from that room \\(the freezer is there too\\) he had to ask me first.\n\nThen I offered to help organize a big party he's throwing next August for his retirement. It started well, but then we argued about making it a non\\-alcohol party and I kind of regretted being the coach. My dad had really bad arguments for having alcohol at the party, then he started on about how he wasn't the only one with an addiction, that my mom was addicted to chocolate...I was able to cut the conversation short and now he's watching TV and we're going to go to the grocery store in a little bit. He's quite agitated so I told him he needed to keep his mind occupied and I keep offering activities, but it doesn't work all the time.\n\nSo, there goes. I'm my dad's alcohol coach. I've only started literally a couple of hours ago and I already understand why my mom never wanted to coach my dad. She wants him to take care of the problem himself, but she still has lots of conversations and arguments about alcohol with my dad.\n\nBut I'm glad I did something. Watching my dad slowly killing himself with his addiction was becoming unbearable. I still don't know if coaching my dad is my best decision, but I can't go back now! I hope he will be out of his crisis soon and I plan on trying to keep talking about alcohol when he's sober. We still need to convince him about the whole alcohol\\-free party thing.",

   "selftext": "Being in my current memory...\n\nI'm grappling with what I feel is a mid-life, dull thud.  It's the kind of feeling that at first glance seems to lack gratitude, a gross feeling that makes you not want to examine any further.\n\nMy life is beautiful.  I am surrounded by successful, loving people.  My work carries its challenges and stressors as work is supposed to, but the rewards are comfort and security.  Our son is heading into adulthood on good footing and I am in love beyond words with my wife.  I am as mentally fit as I've ever been, combining daily recovery, with a healthy dose of new, meaningful friendships.  So why the \"blah\" feeling?\n\nThis prose is prompted by doing something as silly as completing my landscaping.  I live in a new community where the mighty powers of the HOA put you on a strict timeline to complete your landscaping.  Understanding that the wondrous workings of the smallest of governments are here to make sure we all have the appearance of normalcy and success, I am more than willing to comply.  But that's just it, when I was putting in my yard at my first home in my twenties, I was enthusiastic.  I was consumed with the artistic vision of learning and creating something new!  Now I'm, ...ehh.\n\nI can spotlight a ton of those moments in my twenties; My first concert at Red Rocks, a career field that carried otherworldly clout, my first home, the birth of my son... I have memories of how excited I was to be participating in these epic \"life moments\" for the first time.  I was hitting all the benchmarks of what it meant to achieve in a good life.   I will admit, those things came early and easy for me.  I often wonder if my alcoholism developed strictly out of boredom.  Things were too easy and I had to dumb myself down and put myself into finicky health and legal situations just to get the spark of a challenge. The juxtaposition of the upright, middle American citizen, adding the ugliest of taboo consequences of addiction. \n\nSo here I am, kind of feeling like I'm on the verge of sober Jeff 2.0, cycling through some of the former experiences,.... house 2.0, career 2.0, car 2.0, child responsibilities 2.0, all beautiful and perfect,... better than ever, but I just feel like I want to be hyper-cautious not to rinse and repeat my former mistakes.  \n\nI've accidentally stumbled upon a better understanding of the Taoist yin and yang symbol and it's underlying philosophy; The two perfectly symmetrical serpent-like swirls, one black and one white, symbolizing chaos and order.  It's been said or interpreted that a good life lives somewhere on the border of chaos and order.  In fact, there is a small white dot on the black side that will instruct the most chaotic of lives that you can visualize what the order of a good life looks like.  In turn, there is a black dot in the orderly life that reminds us that the best lives will always have a sprinkle of chaos and challenge.  If you live in complete order on the white side, you lack the challenges and are not provoked into risk taking that might allow you to stretch yourself and undertake new and exciting adventures.  If I could summarize the black dot in and orderly life, it is my wife and I watching Anthony Bourdain traveling to Vietnam and us having an intriguing conversation afterwards about what it would take to sell everything and go live there!  Humans long for a certain amount of risk.  It sparks that primal dopamine bump that reminds you that a significant reward could be on the other side.\n\nWhen I was drinking, I was the unsustainable \"whole\" of the Taoist symbol.  I didn't live on the border of chaos and order, I tried to heavily play the role on each side.  Outwardly, I was maintaining a company, paying bills, loving my wife, and raising a good kid.  Inwardly, I was chasing risk, planning my next drunken spree.  In my mind, passing the DMV to get my license renewed because there was always a liquor store two blocks ahead.  And it wasn't that life was bad.  The heavy swings of responsibility contrasting with utter adolescent behavior was its own adventurous game, but the turmoil of hypocrisy in my mind was the torture that was unsustainable.  If your virtue is honesty, you can't live in both places, and for me, if I continued to try, the chaos would win. \n\nThe thing about great memories, the memory of me designing and installing my yard in my twenties, is that you don't recognize them until 15 years later.  Right now I am not enthusiastic about producing the \"next thing\", about landing the next job, or installing the perfect shelving system in my garage.  I have a solid history of achievement in those areas and can't help to think that somehow addiction intertwined with them.\n\nInstead, I am interested in going inward.  I am interested in sitting here and writing this.  Perhaps the next great memory I will have 15 years down the road, will be the period of my life where I didn't create outwardly, but when I sat with what was happening on the inside.  \n\nMaybe I'm in my next great memory at this moment.  \n\nAnd maybe I am now rightfully sitting on the border of order and chaos, because shit, with me sitting here figuring out how my brain works, that landscaping is not going to complete itself.  So the danger of disappointing the HOA police is the \"new balance\"... and it's honest, and procrastination might be the \"new danger\"... and just the right amount of risk... and now I'll get a $300 fine from the homeowners instead of a $3,000 bill from my lawyer. \n\nAnd maybe today I'm creating a new best memory;  The day I learned that the sound that I was hearing was not a dull thud, \"blah\" or \"ehhh\".   It wasn't that at all... \n\nIt was the silent whisper of maturity.  \n\nIt's what wisdom sounds like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

   "selftext": "Hey fellow SD members!  Former poster, turned Lurker (read: drinking heavily), now returning poster.  A few months back I realized where my drinking was going was destroying my life, and worst off I was consciously watching it happen, and too afraid to stop it- After all, how could I phantom what life without a case of beer a day would look like. Before I digress down the rabbit hole I thought I would share a little bit of what help push me through my (recent) days and nights of withdrawals and what kept me pushing through.\n\nFor some slight context a little less than 10 years ago I was in my early-ish 20s and a Boston marathon qualifier.  While also already a heavy drinker at the time, I then was in the process of a divorce, followed by the 2008 market crash, losing my job, and ultimately a house foreclosure.\n\nFast forward to 2018.  I had put on about 40-50 pounds, still somewhat physically active but nothing like the 'old' me.  So..on to the math, and bare in mind these are just generalized numbers for sake of the post.\n\nBeer costs:  $17.08 per day.  This bought me a 18pk or 16oz cans (a pack of 24, 12oz cans) . \nBeer Calories: 102 calories per 12 oz = 2450 calories a day\n\nAverage calories burned per mile ran: 140 calories\nAverage calories required to burn per pound of fat: 3500 calories\n\nSo as I sought out help through a counselor, as I am also dealing with the emotional side effects that a decade+ of life destroying drinking will cause, I was able to put down on paper what for me was the perfect representation of how much alcohol was effecting my life and how the effects of quitting could be immediately observed.\n\nI could be saving about $500 a month, just in beer (let alone all the empty calories). With proper diet and exercise I could quickly cut out 2450 calories from the beer, combined with the average training run of 5 miles...and quickly I would be looking at ~3000 calories per day.  Yes, I see what you are thinking, I gotta eat something right?  Well, what I found from this new sense of not being perpetually hung over is that I was able to (on a weekend) cook nice breakfast burrito, prep all my breakfast food for the week to come, clean up after all the cooking, then deep clean the floors of my condo.  All of this within the span of 3 or 4 hours (7am -11am), where in the past I would have been probably still somewhat drunk, rolling out of bed at 11am looking for what ever was left of the night before and starting all over again.\n\nAnyways, I am sorry if this turned into a rambling tale, but I have taken so much inspiration for those have shared their tales and perspectives while I was finding the courage to face sobriety myself. and hopefully something in here can inspire others who might be facing the same worries I was.  Its only day 9 for me, but all I know is I didn't drink yesterday and I won't drink today, and I'll handle the next day/moment when it comes!\n\nTL;DR Getting sober can save a boat load of money over time, as well as help in getting back to a weight that I am comfortable with!  And hopefully regaining the marathon endurance and running strength I had years ago.",

I have a huge issue in my family of alcoholism and last night made me realize my \"hobby\" has become more of a habit. I know some people may call me a liar over this but it's true and very concerning to me. I polished off a half gallon of captain Morgan and was very surprised at the fact that I felt hardly anything. I became upset and drank straight shots to hopefully send myself into the land of forgetfulness and mistakes. I never reached that point. Never even got close. I hang around a group of people who I guess are \"enablers\" but I will put no blame on them, they are great people who enjoy a casual drink and are impressed by how much I can drink. I continued to drink until my friend who was hosting our weekly drunken get together ended it to go to bed. I finished well over a half gallon and roughly half of a fifth in the course of 2-3 hours and only just began to feel tipsy. I got an uber home and as soon as I laid down next to my wife I began to realize, I really might be an alcoholic. My friends and I have done our drunken get togethers since we all left for college, the military, and regular civilian workforce years ago. What started out as a yearly get together became a monthly get together which became a weekly one. That led to my daily \"get together\" with alcohol. Let me reiterate that I do not and will not put any blame on my friends but I truly do see that I've associated having a good time with them as one where I am having a bottle. Do any of you have any tips on how to kick this and keep my friends? If I need to cut my friends I will, nothing will stand between my wife and I, but I know for a fact that I am the only one out of my pretty tightly knit group of friends who struggles in this way. I admit, shamefully, that i really think I need help. How did any of you quit drinking? How did you keep your friends? Most importantly though, if you have done this, how did you admit to your significant other and/ or friends that you're struggling and need help? I know that a lot of this is pride based, but that's a large issue for me. I view my issue as something that I need to grow out of and that's why I only actually feel comfortable hiding behind a username. I hope I am not wasting any of your time. Any and all advice would be appreciated.",

   "selftext": "I'm sharing an excerpt from one of my favorite Al-Anon books, *Opening Our Hearts, Transforming Our Losses*. [A chapter can be read here.](https://al-anon.org/blog/opening-hearts-transforming-losses) \n\n\n**Changing the dynamics of our relationships**\n\n\nIn Al\u2011Anon we learn how to set boundaries, to say yes when we mean yes, and no when we mean no. We no longer give to others out of obligation, control, or fear, but because we want to give. Once we begin to take better care of ourselves, we can begin to give to others in healthier ways.\n\n\nRecognizing our part in the alcoholic relationship is a crucial component of our recovery. Before we can make positive changes, we must first become aware of the dynamics of the relationship and the role we\u2019ve been playing. Perhaps we were enablers who rescued or made excuses for the alcoholic. Or we may have seen ourselves as victims, helpless to change our circumstances. Maybe our role was to accept all the blame for the alcoholic\u2019s drinking or bad behavior, apologizing for anything that went wrong. Some of our conduct made a bad situation worse.\n\n\nWe examine our role in the family disease not to blame ourselves, but rather to deepen our understanding and compassion for those parts of ourselves we want to change. We cannot break our old patterns without such understanding. Rather than continuing to feel responsible for others, we begin to take responsibility for ourselves and our own actions. We did the best we could at the time with the resources we had, but now that we are aware, we can see another way. As we apply the principles of our program to our day\u2011to\u2011day lives, we begin to respond to situations differently than we had in the past. We give up our illusions of control and our belief that we can change the alcoholic forced sobriety.\n\n\nAs we begin to change, so too will our relationships not just with the alcoholic, but with everyone around us. In any relationship, when one person changes, the entire relationship is altered. Just as we have been affected by the family disease of alcoholism, those around us will be affected by our recovery as we begin to heal. Even though we may want a change in our relationship, the change itself can be a loss.\n\n\nNot everyone will be happy about the new changes in us including ourselves at times. We may reminisce about how things used to be and may even try to convince ourselves that things weren\u2019t so bad before recovery. We can expect a temporary period of upset or increased crisis at this time. This doesn\u2019t mean we should go back to the way things were, though we may be feeling pressure to do so. Positive changes don\u2019t always feel right at first. On those days when going back may seem easier, we can trust that our Higher Power has guided us to this point in our lives. We are precisely where we need to be.",

   "selftext": "I\u2019m new here. I\u2019m trying a dry May. I tried a dry Jan and made it 15 days before caving. Since then I had one stretch of 9 days, several of 1 or 2, but many wine drinking days. I have been a crazy heavy drinker for over 40 years, and until Jan 1 of this year, it had been probably a decade since I had not drunk 3 of those 500 mL wine cubes every night. I even packed them in my suitcase on travel, just in case they weren\u2019t sold at my destination. Seriously, the only exceptions to downing 3 boxes \\(the equivalent of a 1.5 L bottle of wine\\) were the odd day every few years when I had to do a medical prep over night. Since Jan 1, even though I haven\u2019t been dry most of the time, on the nights I\u2019ve had wine, it\u2019s been considerably less than 3 wine boxes.\n\nI have a laundry list of signs and symptoms that point to neuro compromise, liver problems, gastritis, etc., etc., so I am committed, since I\u2019d prefer not to die early or have my brain rot, but clearly this is a struggle. On the one hand, I\u2019m proud of having drunk so much less in 2018 than ever before, and I\u2019ve lost 20\\+ pounds since Jan 1. However, I think that part of my mental illness is to shift the focus to weight loss \\(not that I really need to lose any more\\), not alcohol, and that allows my alcohol soaked brain to rationalize that only 1 or 2 boxes, if I skip dinner, won\u2019t really make me fat, so..... yeah, you get it.\n\nI\u2019m basically 100&amp;#37; A\\-OK all day with the exception of the late afternoon/ early night window, where my brain attacks me with every single reason why I should have some wine 'just tonight\u2019. For me, if I can push through the window of 5\\-7 pm, the rest of the night is easier settled into my routine in my night clothes. Then it\u2019s MUCH less likely that I will make a wine run. Sometimes, depending on what\u2019s up, that window does expand to about 3:30 to maybe 8. So a max of 4.5 hours, but usually just 2 \\- and it\u2019s that stretch of time, in spite of feeling calm and confident all the rest of the day, that really do me in.\n\nIn addition to the health reasons for quitting, I have been emotionally absent from my husband and children for years, and honestly, we\u2019re seeing the effects at this point. I have become almost reclusive, not wanting to go anywhere or do anything other than come home, sit in my corner, drink and watch something or read \\(if I\u2019m not too blurry\\). This is really a big thing for me. It was a breakthrough in March, when I invited my husband to accompany me on a business trip. For 2 of the 3 nights, I had minimal, pretty much normal consumption of a couple of glasses, but blew it on the middle night, sucking down a whole, super expensive bottle of wine in the stall of the lobby ladies room. So stupid, and missed a great dinner. Roller coaster \\- up and down and up and down.\n\nTrying to make it stick this time, it\u2019s May 4, and I haven\u2019t had a drink all month \\(all 3 nights!\\). I\u2019ve joined this Reddit group \\(my first\\), gotten the Nomo app on my phone, and I read the Flipboard alcoholism articles every day. I also write in my diary, still titled, \u2018Dry January\u2019. ha. It really, really helps me get through the bewitching hours, if I have done this \u2018work\u2019. When I don\u2019t do it, I\u2019m much more likely to rationalize and blow it.\n\nI am glad I joined this group, because you all sound so lovely, non judgmental, and supportive in your comments to folks who struggle on this front.",

   "selftext": "Hi, all! I am a longtime lurker often inspired by everyone's posts and support. I think of this as a place I would walk by on my way to make bad decisions; a place welcoming me to enter but I just wasn't ready.\n\nI will try to spare my Gays of our Lives sob story. The cliffs notes version is that my roommate of two years and I became romantic last summer. He was very promiscous before me; I am seven years his senior; there is a lot of STUFF that happened before this; I fell out of love with him at the same time he realized he was in love with me. Men are like that.\n\nI used to be the fun drunk who hosted parties and knew everyone at the club by name and I was friendly and popular and I just liked to FLIRT.\n\nI become a very angry, raging, vengeful drunk around him. I am ridiculously non-confrontational when sober. Now I combine one drink and Adderall (which I take as prescribed, not abusing) and I just get downright scary, and all the stuff I kept inside comes out. \"Oh, yeah? Well in November 2016 when you demanded my 120-pound ass to move the bookshelf and I moved the wrong one, you sent me a rude text about it and it HURT MY FEELINGS! FUCK YOU!\"\n\nWe got in a fight at the club in front of everyone last night at the RuPaul's Drag Race party! He was Eureka and I was The Vixen. Even security came over. We got home and beat the crap out of each other. I slapped him like I was Stephanie McMahon. He shoved me into the cabinet and I hit the back of my head. I scream at him every time I drink (since November). When I am sober, I clam up because I feel too sad and defeated to argue. The only reason the upstairs neighbor doesn't call the cops on us is because he wants to screw us. (Sad but true, and it's NOT going to happen)\n\nI am moving back home for at least a month and I am producing a play this summer and my goal is to not drink until Pride (last weekend of June). I know I should say until forever. I've been in therapy and advised to go to substance abuse counseling. Forever is too scary! I tell myself that if this person leaves my life, I won't be this way anymore. Deep down I know that's crap. Last week he was on vacation and my drunk ass blocked him on social media just to prove ... Something.\n\nI don't want to do this anymore. I am sad and ashamed all day. I have the right to have feelings but I don't have the right to treat another person this way. I am late for work every Friday. It is a miracle I am employed. Carrie Fisher said she didn't figure out she was bipolar until she quit drinking, because alcoholism and drug use are so similar that you have to be sober before you can differentiate it from other mental illness. And even if I'm actually bipolar, I can't use it as an excuse to be an incompetent manchild who is an asshole to his quasi-boyfriend.\n\nThank you all for letting me share. Keep doing what you're doing!\n\nIWNDWYT",

We talked about drinking early on in our relationship and decided we saw too much negative in drinking and we generally don't drink.  Socially maybe every other month.  However part of that has been with our neighbor, one of my friends who is a hard core alcoholic.  Hard. Core.  She drinks all night, sleeps till 5 or 6 pm.  Her spouse is very unhappy and I know from our private conversations that dumping her is on the table, but she has invested so much, she is reluctant to pull the trigger.\n\nSkip ahead, I am becoming bothered by the fact she texts my spouse (he's a gay man, she's a lesbian) at 3AM to come drinking.  Not that anything came of it as he slept through it, but I am bothered by the fact she thought it was appropriate.  We are neighbors, which kind of exacerbates this.\n\nLast weekend she texted at 1AM when we were still awake, but I still think this was not something \"decent\" people should do.  It had been a month since we had anything to drink so I begrudgingly said let's go, he ended up staying and drinking till 10AM.\n\nI feel like she wants to groom him to be her drinking buddy.  She probably perceives me as being able to support us both just as her wife does, so they can while away the nights drinking.  I told him before we went that I wouldn't have alcohol change our plans again (of course the next day is lost after a night of drinking).\n\nMy question is has anyone seen this grooming behavior before, where someone detects a predisposition to drinking as my husband has and tries to exploit it?  I am considering saying we can't socialize with them any more because you can't ask an alcoholic to be responsible with alcohol in any way, certainly not because it will harm someone else.  This has blindsided me, though it's not truly a problem yet, it's bothering me a lot.  I hate to end a marriage in short order, but I won't have alcohol be a point of contention in my marriage.  I now it's futile.  He has never drunk enough to really crave it or have a routine, but when it's around and he's started, he only wants more.  Nothing matters.  For that reason we simply don't drink and he doesn't miss it as long as he hasn't started, but multiple texts offering it can make a difference, especially if they are well-timed on a weekend.\n\nDo any recovered alcoholics have input?  I want to tell her sorry you have no friends who want to drink all night, but my spouse is married to me.",

   "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI would like your advice.\n\nAlcoholism runs in my maternal family. My uncle fucked up his life because of the alcohol, and maybe my grandmother, mother and other uncle are alcoholic. (Right now I'm dating a \"recovered\" alcoholic.)\n\nI had my first beer (accidentally) at 9 years old. I didn't drink again until I was 19 or something like that. Right now I am 24.\n\nI've always been afraid of alcohol, of drunk people and of getting drunk. There are countless reasons for this. But I've always known that I COULD be an alcoholic because of my genes.\n\nI've become quite fond of beer and like pretty much any alcohol, except vodka. However, I only drink in very controlled environments: alone, with my mother, or with my boyfriend.\nIn the last five years or so, I've built up my tolerance to the point where I can happily drink 6 common beers, 6 shots of brandy, 2 glasses of wine, and still be fine. (I weigh about 49 kilograms, or 108 pounds and I am a female) Beers are like water for me now, but I avoid drinking with coworkers or strangers in general because I'm afraid they'll judge the amount. \nI like beer (and the other alcohols) because of the taste. I am quite selective and try to become an expert in beer. I do not drink for the sake of the effects of alcohol, which I do not experience and do not wish to. At most, I'll feel dizzy and I'll stop. But that doesn't really happen anymore. Also, I drink a lot of water while I'm consuming alcohol.\n\nIn a week, I drink two to four days. Usually it's anything between a normal beer to six beers per day. So there are weeks when I consume 2, and weeks when I drink about 24 beers. Normally it's about 6 beers per week. \n\nI do not feel anxious if I cannot drink, and I have a lot of chronic health issues going on, but my first question is to the doctors is: \"Can I still drink while I'm on this medicine?\" Beer is the only thing I actually WISH to ingest; for some reason I've lost interest in food. I eat, but I'd rather drink. I can afford my consumption. I have always been a responsible student and employee. But a doctor said that, because of the amount of alcohol I drink per week, I qualify as an alcoholic.\n\nIs this possible?\nAm I an alcoholic in denial?\nDo I need help?\n\nSorry for the length and thank you.\n",

I do not question this as, for as many of those out there whom have been afflicted with alcoholism, there are just as many who have no trouble understanding and managing their relationship with the abuse of the universally-accepted substance.\n\nThe cure for a physical addiction is simply to reduce/deny consumption. After physical addiction has been omitted, it leaves only the psychological aspect of the behavior. (The real beast for most of us) At this point, alcohol, like many drugs that immediately give the user a sense of reward and spiritual fulfillment, can be used to achieved exactly this: Purpose and a reason for being. Further touching on the human sense of work and reward, it's no wonder that we celebrate great achievements with champagne, wine, and spirits. Alcohol stimulates the reward center of our brains. Humanity knows this. We've known this for thousands of years.\n\nA noticeable pattern in those with a great affinity for alcohol is that they: Not able to achieve great fulfillment in their day-to-day lives, have built the habit of becoming dependent on the sense of reward given to them by the consumption of alcohol. As the reward is of a chemical nature existing within our brains, it is no less real than the true rewards we achieve in our endeavors.",

   "selftext": "Here's the gist of it...my boyfriend has struggled with alcohol fairly consistently for the past year (he's 30). In January of this year, his family had enough and told him if he didn't go to rehab, they were choosing to disconnect from him. He obliged, but I feel it was only because he didn't want to lose them. He completed a 30-day rehab during the beginning of this year, and things were good for a couple of months.\n\nFast forward to April of this year...I found he had Kratom and Phenibut that he said he was using to help keep him away from alcohol. I believe he has been abusing both of these substances, and this past week found a bottle of vodka.\n\nHere's my question--his family and myself have had enough, and it's getting to the point that this is dangerous. Before he went to rehab, he was hospitalized with a BAC of .37. If it gets back to that point, there's no telling what could happen. I am thinking of confronting him and then leaving until he decides to get serious about being sober. His family has written letters to him (they're in a different state) which will be presented to him in a couple of days. Is it too much to pull everything out from under him at once, i.e., family and myself (we've been together 6 years), or should I just leave first and then if he still doesn't get help, bring his family in?\n\nAs of this posting, he does not know that his family or myself know he has been continuing to drink / use Kratom.",

   "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm not really sure if this is the place, but I'm worried about my friend's happiness and wanted to see if others who are in/have been in a situation similar to hers could share experiences me to help me understand and know how to approach this. I understand that you do not offer advice here, only suggestions and support/personal experiences. That's the kind of thing I'm after.\n\nMy best friend is the most vibrant, incredible, bright, talented young woman. She is genuinely an exceptional person. Last year she dated this guy, Matt, and they were together for almost a year. Matt is an alcoholic who seems to accept this about half of the time, and still thinks he doesn't have a problem the other half.\n\nMy friend broke up with him after too many repeated disappointments (making commitments and not showing up because of drinking, lying or avoiding truths, not putting in any effort to certain parts of their relationship). During their relationship, he also gave her Herpes and lied about it twice before coming clean. She understands that this constitutes sexual abuse and was rightfully furious. This happened early in the relationship.\n\nHowever, after the break up, she was a wreck and very unhappy because she says she loves him so much and saw a future with him etc etc. I, along with other friends and family, was unbelievably relieved it was over, after seeing her constant disappointment and unhappiness. They stayed apart for a number of months, but now it looks like she's seriously getting back together with him.\n\nReddit, I know I can't control this, and I don't want to. But I really want to arm her with as much information as I can in a kind, supportive way before she commits to this. I've suggested she read stories online, but she says she doesn't like being slouched over a screen reading stuff like that cos it's depressing and doesn't vibe with her. She continues to downplay alcoholism, as if it isn't such a big deal after all, and is saying things like \"god sometimes I wish we could just run away together and everything would be okay.\" She says all relationships take compromise and maybe this is just their compromise (as if the other problem areas don't exist).\n\nShe also said to me, \"Surely there exist people who have happy relationships with addicts? They must be able to have fulfilling relationships too.\" I honestly don't know if happy, fulfilled relationships do exist with current (not recovering) addicts. I'm aware that those in long marriages/commitments must try very hard, so maybe it exists. I am just so concerned as she is so young and early days with him, even for a regular relationship a year is so short, and he is much older and doesn't have his life together (even aside from the alcoholism, that's just the part that really isn't his fault.) If she keeps trying to make this work, I'm worried that no one event will ever be \"bad\" enough to leave him even if she becomes miserable overall.\n\nSo my first question is, does anyone here have a positive story, a fantastic and healthy relationship with an alcoholic?\n\nIs there anything you would suggest I tell her or suggest to her before making the commitment that might help her make her decision?\n\nIs there anything that personal experience has taught you re establishing boundaries that helps IN the relationship, if she does choose to get back together with him?\n\nDo you have any suggestions for how I speak tactfully about this with her? I'm already trying to 1) never tell her what to do, just ask her questions and speak about my opinions of certain things, 2) never say anything bad about him as a person, and highlight that I'm sure he's a good person but this problem is large, 3. Always give a positive aspect before negative points (e.g. \"it's great that you're thinking so much about this before making a decision, at least whatever you choose you know you didn't take it lightly. I'm just concerned that...\"). Any feedback on this or ideas on how to present info would be great.\n\nTl;dr: 24yo friend probably getting back together with 36yo alcoholic ex who ruined their year-long relationship before by lying about drinking, avoiding commitments, and giving her an std and lying about it. Looking for any suggestions or experiences you have to share to help me put things into perspective/be a supportive friend. \n\nThank you!",

I frequent this sub. I eat well and hydrate. I've been killing it professionally and personally. I've managed to save my marriage from the brink of ruin and it's getting stronger every day. I'm finally in therapy for issues of past trauma and I read about alcoholism, communication skills, and spiritual growth in my free time.  I go to AA once or twice a week. I like the meetings for the most part. It's helpful to be a part of a community of people of all walks, but all battling the same dark, insidious force of alcohol. However, now that I've been going for a couple months I'm starting to get to know some of the members and feel pressure to commit to a sponsor and work the steps and to be honest, I don't want the commitment and I'm a little turned off by the cult vibe. I haven't met anyone I've connected with enough to feel comfortable asking to be my sponsor, and even if I did, I don't want to prioritize making meetings and commiting to service positions. I have a full and rich life at the moment and I feel anxiety about the idea of trying to fit more obligations (especially social obligations which drain my introvert batteries). Finally, I don't think I would be able to fully deliver the AA message to new comers with the sincere zeal I've seen in so many members. Maybe I would if I had found AA in that window of desperation that happens in the first few weeks, but I made it out of that place using other tools. They say nobody comes to AA for the first time on a high note, but I kinda did. I love my life and I feel confident in my sobriety. I would love to have AA in my toolbox, but I don't want it to be the main component of my sobriety plan. Am I kidding myself by think I can stay sober without AA? According to countless people I've heard share in meetings,  I will eventually fall off the wagon if I don't. What do y'all think? ",

   "selftext": "Hi!\n\nSo some backstory: I quit drinking one month ago (30 days sober as of today). I would say that I was a functioning alcoholic. I mean that in the way that I wouldn't drink every day or get black out drunk. But I did drink about 4/5 days a week, mostly wine and beer, and when I drank I couldn't stop at just one glass of wine or one beer. I would also often drink alone. So I am aware that I am not one of those people who can drink occasionally a glass of wine. When I drank I always craved more. So I quit drinking a month ago, haven't had any withdrawal symptoms, but I do crave alcohol from time to time. \n Also about a month ago I met a new guy, and we have been on several dates so far, and talked about being exclusive and both wanting a serious relationship. I wouldn't say I am in love with him, but I do like him a lot and look forward to what may come out of it. The problem is I knew his mother died 3 years ago (he is 30, I am 29), but recently he told me that she died of alcoholism. She had been an alcoholic his whole life and because of it during part of his childhood he lived with his grandmother. She also had been in and out rehab, tried to quit several times, etc. the whole story. Moreover, he never met his father, so despite all this, his relationship with his mother was quite close.\nSo, since I have just met him and I didn't want to scare him away, I haven't told him yet about my problems with alcohol. Now I am even more afraid that knowing my struggle with alcoholism will scare him away, but at the same time I feel that it is unfair to keep it a secret from him, given his past. I feel like I should tell him, because I feel like, given his mother's story, we would not want to get involved with someone like me. \n\nSo my question is: what would you do if you were in my place? Would you tell him right away in case he didn't want to pursue a relationship with someone like me? or would you wait to see how things go?\n\ntldr; I quit drinking a month ago, my new boyfriend (been dating for one month) just told me his mother died of alcoholism. Have not told him yet about my struggle with alcohol. Not sure if I should tell him now or wait.",

I actually got good and pissed off and debated going somewhere else to try and save a few cents when the reality of my situation hit me like a bolt of lightning: every week I typically spend between $150 -$200 on booze without a thought. I'd spend less on food so I could afford beer and whiskey and if I couldn't afford it I'd take money from my line of credit to drink with...\n\nI kind of felt like I was two different people at the same time; drunk me and sober me were having a tug of war over that bottle of fizzy water and the insanity of my drunk way of living reeeally hit home.

As i was going to bed hungover from the previous night i had some sort of hallucinations and I saw flashy images in my dark room. But I experienced that stuff already before. The things that schocked me extremely were my dreams. Frightening, dark dreams in which i ran from something. And when i woke up very sweaty and scared the hallucinations were slightly stronger than before but they vanished quickly. Google was surprisingly not very revealing. I found out that alcohol can cause psychadelic experiences when hungover and dehydrated. \n\nI want to reduce my alcohol consumption but I think partying without alcohol is kinda boring. My assumption is that I will stop drinking alcohol when I stop partying, has anyone experiences where they thought the same thing, but didn't stop?

   "selftext": "It's really frustrating.  I'd had a bottle of wine the whole time I've been home from the hospital...  A 750mL bottle, at that.  Not even close my typical 1.5L bottle per night that I was dosing up until I was taken to the hospital by the police.  Then, late last week, my new psychiatrist took me off of one med I was taking at a super high dose and put me on a low dose of Seroquel (because, as she and I both know, starting at a therapeutic dose of Seroquel from the get-go means sleeping 18-20+ hours a day for months).  Two days after that change, my panic attacks came back and are worse than they've been in a couple of years.  I'm throwing up from them again, afraid to leave my apartment, afraid to leave my bed...  I'm even having them in my sleep again.\n\nToday I ended up buying a bottle of wine that is usually $12-15 per 1.5L bottle but was on sale for $6.99.  I couldn't resist when I saw the sale.  I intentionally got a low-alcohol containing variety because my tolerance is lower and I don't want to do something exponentially more stupid.\n\nI'm not drunk now.  I just got back from the store and poured myself a glass, but I've been staring at it the whole time after taking a sip.  I'm disappointing myself, my fiance, and my family, and they don't even know it yet.  This is the best sobriety streak I've had in years...\n\nYou all know the struggle.  Talk some sense into me.  I know the panic attacks will subside in a few days (the med change coincided with my period--two of the strongest triggers at once), I've lost 40lbs and don't need to drink empty calories...  But I'm so afraid to go out right now, and with my med changes, I'm on *nothing* for anxiety for the first time in almost ten years.  I've only had two therapy sessions.  I don't know how to cope.\n\nThanks...  &lt;3\n\nA Noteworthy Edit:\n\nI was put on Naltrexone at the first hospital I was at during my two-month inpatient stays.  It definitely helped with the cravings.  They said it would make it difficult for me to feel the alcohol's intoxication as well, although, since I was in the hospital, I never experienced that.  Should I ask for that again?  My therapist works at the same place as my psychiatrist and I have an appointment there on Friday morning.",

I though hm... they might be onto something so I haven\u2019t  drank for the last few days but I feel like complete crap. My arms are really weak, I can barely text on my phone which seems to be a symptom of alcoholism. Is there a form of alcoholism where it\u2019s really \u201ceasy\u201d to quit like this? Besides the physical symptoms which really suck right now, I don\u2019t really feel I have a problem? I\u2019ve thought of having one or two drinks to lessen the symptoms but that makes me feel I\u2019d be more passable as an alcoholic telling myself there isn\u2019t a problem and just keep drinking. I thought about going to a rehab but it feels like I should be able to manage this on my own since the addiction seems to be only physical. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. ",

It got really bad when I left for college (I'm his youngest and only daughter). He tried to quit cold turkey by going to meetings alone, and it worked for a year until he relapsed, got a DUI, spent the night in prison and then went to rehab for a month.\n\nWe've had a tough year.

I just found out from my mom that he may have been drinking for months at this point, but she didn't want to tell any of us to not worry us.\n\nI called my dad on it, and he actually admitted to me that he has been drinking, but that it's under control and it's just a minor setback. I could tell the entire time I was talking to him that it was the addict talking and not my dad bc he has a certain way of speaking when he's like that.\n\nI called my two uncles who have been a great support system and have combined something like 30+ years sober. They're working on confronting him in a way that doesn't make life more miserable for my mom, who he's incredibly angry at right now for telling me.\n\nMy question is what do I do now? I don't want to cut him off because I feel like he needs support right now, but I also don't want to make it seem like I'm at all ok with the fact that he's drinking. I also don't want to sit around and wait until he gets another DUI or kills himself or someone else. I also do not want to speak to him when he's drunk. I feel pretty numb to the situation honestly and am just annoyed that I have to go through this a third time. Any advice would be super helpful, thanks in advance.",

   "selftext": "I've known for a long time that I drink too much, but this is the first time I've admitted I have a serious problem... \n\nI've suffered mental health problems for pretty much all my adult life. I'm 27 now and watch myself deteriorate physically and mentally as my alcohol intake steadily increases. When I lost my grandmother and developed type 1 diabetes within a short space of time my drinking became pretty much a daily thing. What started as a bottle of wine every other night has developed into not being able to sleep properly without a bottle of whiskey.\n\nI've been pulled up once or twice by my family and promised to reduce my drinking. Instead of reducing my drinking I've just become more proficient at hiding and disposing empty bottles. I rotate between 3 or 4 supermarkets to buy drink so I don't 'look' like an alcoholic buying booze. I realise now this is the behaviour of someone with a problem.\n\nI'm blessed with wonderful people in my life, but I've never discussed these issues in much detail. I know my drinking will eventually harm these people if it hasn't already and I don't want that to happen. My drinking didn't used to effect my job but I've missed a good 2-3 shifts in the past few months because I was too hungover to go in. I was supposed to work New Year's Day but attempted to overdose on insulin on NYE and spent the night in hospital. I've had various therapies and been prescribed anxiety/depression meds but these are useless unless I stop drinking.\n\nIn social situations, I simply cannot control my drinking even though I promise myself I won't overindulge. I went to a house party for my girlfriend's birthday on Saturday. The plan was for me to stay the night but I woke up the next day in my own bed with absolutely no recollection how I got back.\n\nAlcoholism killed my Granddad. It killed my dad and I know if carry on down this path, it will kill me, especially when I already have type 1 diabetes.\n\nI discovered this subreddit a few days ago. Reading the experiences and stories of everyone here has given the clarity that I can, and will stop drinking. \n\nHere's to day 1!",

My friend\u2019s mom died when she was young, so my friend doesn\u2019t really have any other family except for her husband and their young son. Her father announced while they were setting up for the grandson\u2019s birthday that he had six months to live because he has entered advanced stages of cirrhosis. The doctors have tried to get him to stop drinking. He is moving to be close to his siblings, presumably to die there. I remember seeing him at the birthday party, and he was holding onto a small coke can for the whole two hours in a way that, along with his demeanor, made me wonder if he was drinking alcohol (I didn\u2019t know any of this backstory at the time). It kind of makes it doubly sad, doesn\u2019t it? He tells his daughter he is dying from alcohol as he is drinking alcohol. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what the moral of the story is except that it helps me steel my will against drinking because I have a young son.

   "selftext": "This past week I have gone days without taking kratom at all, and at most I'm taking 3-4 grams per day to help me sleep and do the 'taper' like I originally planned. This was an unexpected attempt at TAPERING. And I feel GREAT. Please stick with me - \n\nI've been crying out to this community for advice on what to do. My addiction felt so bad I just KNEW I needed something like suboxone to help me come off of it. Actually, it was all the other unhealthy practices in my life that was making everything worse than it had to be. \n\nI asked advice on taking subs to get off of this, because my withdrawal has been so severe in the past. I've tried quitting cold turkey at least 3 times now. **The last time I did it, I guess about a year ago, I made it a month and a half until a full blown relapse.** I mean I could not function without it. I was miserable to everyone around me. And for the sake of my job, and for my interactions with my son, I decided to get back on it. I thought I'd just take a little to function healthily. You know how this thing works and I found myself taking 30-45 grams a day, even though I felt like shit all the time I kept taking more thinking it was the only thing that could make me feel better - when in reality, it was the thing keeping me down.\n\nRecently, I asked for advice on taking suboxone or something of the sort for help getting off of this. Almost unanimously people were telling me to taper. They said it was the only way - and they were right, in my case. \n\nI started slowing down my usage, with no actual plans to come off of this drug right away. That was around 3 weeks to a month ago. Well between my alcoholism and other problems I was having in my life I decided to take some time off of work. I asked for 2 and a half weeks. The first half of the week I really cut my usage, massively. Stopped drinking and just did what I could to get by. It was difficult. In fact I didn't even realize that my lethargy, restlessness at night, loss of appetite, etc etc were all to blame simply because I cut my dosage. Sounds ridiculous after I've been through it before, but it was when the diarrhea hit that I realized I was actually withdrawing. Believe it or not this gave me courage. **I realized I had made a big step.** \n\nLast week, my first full week off of work, I went days without taking kratom and the days that I did I kept it very small. I was taking around 6 grams on the days that I did. At first it was difficult, I had a lot of trouble sleeping. But it was nowhere near as bad as when I went CT, and this time I was determined. So towards the end of the week I not only decided to stick to 2-4 grams a day IF I USED AT ALL, but I asked here about supplements. \n\n**This is where everything changed for me. The usefulness of supplements cannot be understated.** That next morning when I woke up and did not feel the NEED for kratom was incredible. I had breakfast without taking any, and admittedly, I started getting the symptoms. Mildly. The sweats, temperature fluctuations, restlessness. After eating I was stuck with it for a little while. But I took all my supplements and felt much better, and I ended up taking only 2 grams that day. Felt great for the rest of the day. **On two grams, I felt great.** Again, woke up with no urgency to take kratom. Again ate breakfast without taking a morning dose, and the withdrawal symptoms presented themselves, VERY mildly. In fact they went away after 20 minutes or so with no help from anything else. I went the rest of that day without dosing and took 1 gram to help me get a good night's rest that night. Slept beautifully, woke up again feeling like a million bucks.\n\nNow my sex drive is back, I'm thinking clearly again, my emotions feel real, I'm motivated to take care of my business...and I'm down to 2-4grams per day. Still tapering. I feel no urgency to do any more than I am now, and I also feel no urgency to pull the rug out from under myself. I'm going to continue tapering until I feel comfortable jumping off completely. It does not feel overwhelming at all any more. It feels like something I'm in the process of conquering. \n\nMuch love to those of you who encouraged me, who told me what supplements to get and advised me on tapering. **Before anyone gets concerned about me spiking the ball before I cross into the inzone, I am very well aware that this is a very serious matter. I have absolutely no option but to either give up or to finally beat these addictions and start living a healthy life, now. I'm done with excuses.** I'm seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist tomorrow. Now begins healing.\n\nIf anyone is interested in my supplement regimen, I'd be happy to share. I take supplements in the morning, midday, and at night before bed. Quite a few, actually, but they are all natural such as fish oil and magnesium, things of the sort. All of them together made a massive difference, that was when I REALLY started to feel better.\n\nJust wanted to share, everyone. My appetite is coming back, at EVERY point I'm fighting to do the right thing. **I want to let you all know that tapering is effective and can be done while continuing to function. Supplements made a huge difference for me as well. Every one of you who is struggling with this should take that into consideration. CT is just not for some of us.**",

All those post are keeping me afloat.\n\nThe more I read the more I feel the need for a support group such as AA. The thing is AA is really not appealing to me. The belief side of it is against everything I believe and don't get me wrong I have no problem with Christians or any other religious community. I am married to a strong believer, I go to mass (mainly to please her) and my own belief are constantly being challenged. The problem is that the steps are not something I can live with and I strongly disapprove the need for a superior being to heal me. I think it has to come from me and nobody else.\n\nI don't know how this will translate in English but ther is saying that goes by: \"help yourself and God will help you'.

   "selftext": "Hi SD\n\nI've been lurking around here for a while, commenting occasionally, but I never really thought I would make a post about my situation as I didn't think it would help. I still don't, but I wanted to post some thoughts I have on alcoholism and mental health issues/disability, and ask some questions of people who have managed long stretches of sobriety. Apologies in advance.\n\nI'm a 35 year old man, and was diagnosed with autism two years ago (I will return to this shortly). I've been a functioning alcoholic for around five years now, with a marked turn for the worse in quantity and frequency of drinking in the last year or so. I started drinking fairly late, around my mid 20s, mainly to assuage the social problems that autism - or more precisely, the way autistic people are supposed to shoehorn themselves into societal systems that are completely unsuited and basically unnatural to us - has caused for me. I had been an awkward loner throughout my teenage years and early twenties, but I discovered alcohol and how it made me feel more open and less awkward and dysfunctional. This isn't to say I'm absolved of responsibility for my situation, but more of an explanatory device. \n\nI work in an extremely pressurised environment in an ambulance service (dw I never went in drunk, and rarely went in hungover) where I have dealt with tens of thousands of incidents, many of them extremely unpleasant. That side of the job has never bothered me, but I think the pressure has finally taken its toll. The NHS in the UK was subjected to the most intense pressure in at least 20 years last winter and I don't think it is a coincidence that my drinking and mental health nosedived over the course of, it to the point that I had to request a move off of frontline duties before I went off on long term sick, or killed myself. It was a very bad time. I was drinking heavily every day I wasn't in work, usually around 10 cans of cider and a few bottles of beer. My usual bed was the floor in my living room.\n\nMy drinking has basically developed from social to boredom drinking. I never wake up in the morning wanting or needing a drink but it's when that half hour before the off licence shuts time comes around my resolve just crumbles. I'm sure some of you know that feeling. I know I'm an alcoholic tho, just a different type of alcoholic than to some. I've had several good attempts at getting sober but I just crack each time. I'm on three days atm. \n\nOne of the problems I have is that I *know* that even without boozing my problems won't go away. I'm going to be autistic until the day that I die. I'm not going to have a social life because all my friends drink alcohol non stop and I a) can't moderate or stay on soft drinks and b) can't make friends without the crutch. So I'm trying to be sober but I'm not really enthusiastic about it, or jumping for joy at feeling better, I'm just sad because I know that my life is probably going to be one of solitude. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading. I have a couple of questions for long term ppl if anyone could answer them.\n",

   "selftext": "DISCLAIMER\n\nThere is a looong first part, where I just kind of tell my background, because I think that it influenced me and my general state of mind. \n\nIt would be too long to write everything down \\(it already is now, tbh\\), so I'll just add a quick explanation for those who don't have the time to read the whole text or who don't understand why I even wrote this stuff in the first place:\n\n\\-My mind was already complicated as a kid, it was almost impossible to get me to do anything that I didn't really want\n\n\\-I'm very bad at handling emotions because I never learned how to express them \\(or at least, I think so\\)\n\n\\-I think I might be bipolar or something, but it's just self diagnosed.\n\n\\-The story about the wrong crowd is just to tell that it took me a really long time to get a stable grip on life, and that I think that it left me behind most of my peers on an emotional level, plus it gave me a lot of emotional stuff to digest. It also left me feeling like a missfit with almost everyone, and gave me a pessimistic view on the world, which, altogether, certainly doesn't help. \n\n\\-Last point: I'm often told that I have the character of both my grandfathers. They are both remembered as strong, well respected and intelligent men, but with a very restless character and an inabillity to express their emotions in general, which lead them to strong \\(but still \"perfectly\" functioning\\) alcoholism and heavy smoking. They both died at approx. 65 years, I never really got to know them. And I don't want to go down that road too. \n\nTo skip the first part, just go to the \"NOW\"\\-paragraph.\n\nI've been a \"difficult kid\" since my early days. My teachers always told my parents how intelligent and polite I was, but also how difficult it was to get me to do anything. They'd call home and accuse me of \"passive resistance\", meaning that I wasn't actually disturbing anyone, or being a dick or whatever, I was just politely refusing to do anything, and if they forced me to do something, I just did my best to accomplish my task in the worst possible way.\n\nI'm not sure why I was like this, but anyways, in my early teenage years I had my typical teenage self\\-esteem crash, but maybe a little bit stronger than what's normal. I was a very skinny kid, and very insecure. So insecure that I feared to think, because I assumed that, maybe, other people would be able to hear what I was thinking. And I had normal thoughts, really, it's not like I was imagining how I'd kill my classmates or anything like this. \n\nI started to hang out with the wrong crowd. I decided that I needed to be hard. So I threw out all the books from my room, stopped communicating with my parents and instead started only doing pushups and listening to hip hop. Pretty stereotypical. I think that I was just afraid of life in general, and thought I would be alright as long as I was a though motherfucker, which of course I never became, since that's just not who I am. My new friends were the kind of 14 year olds to deal drugs, visit prostitutes, get into fights all the time and generally not care too much about life in general. I was not like this, so I ended up being friends with thugs and nice kids at the same time, not knowing where to fit in. I dealed drugs myself, even though I really didn't need to, my family is what you could call \"well off\". I did good, I always kept it lowkey and never ripped people off, and everybody respected me. \n\nBut I started to see how some of the pople I knew really started going down the wrong track. They stealed cars, robbed stores, started getting into struggle with the law regularly, accumulated large debts when they got caught doing graffitis all over town and then also started bombing trains. I was loosing my grip on life, I didn't know who I was anymore, and started abusing alcohol and weed. I was depressed, I think. The worst point was when a childhood friend killed two people, but it took the police almost two years to find out it was him. And this only because he told everyone, and someone finally ratted him out, for a significant sum of money, as far as I know. Some time later, a friend commited suicide, and two other firends were put into a closed psychiatry after several failed suicide attempts.\n\nAll the while, I had no one to talk to, and I just kind of took everything into me without knowing how to release it. I did a lot of sports, but my trainer was an \"ex \\-\"gangmember from a well known \\(and feared\\) latin street gang, and he basically only told us how to get harder and never show emotions, which probably wasn't exactly what I needed, either. Plus any benefits sport might have had on my mind were rapidly eradicated by downing bottles of cheap rum or smoking too much weed.\n\nI'm sure that my parents never really new about all the shit I had seen or was seeing on a daily basis, and what the people in my sourrounding were doing to my character. They just put off my lethargic behaviour as a normal teenage thing. \n\nNOW:\n\nIt's been some years since all of this \\(I've just turned 21 now\\), and I'm in college. But I can't study. I just don't feel like it, which is normal, so I just force myself to study, but I always end up failing. I've even gone so far to get all distractions away from me \\(blocked my phone, disabled any internet connection, locked my ps4 away\\), but I ended up looking at the ceiling. I think it's because of stress. I think that my teenage days were so full of negative stuff going on, and my mind so confused, that I never really learned how to deal with stress or my emotions in general, which means that the slightest distraction is able to totally get me off my studying or from really using my head in general. It's not that I am lazy, I go to the gym regularly \\(3\\-4 days/week, at 0730\\), I wash, I cook, I work a lot of hours because it feels good to at least be productive in that way and make some cash. \n\nAs soon as I start studying, though, I become absolutely restless. I start feeling stressed, depressed, apathetic. I don't understand what I'm reading, I start questioning my life, I'm not happy about anything anymore \\(this also happens when I'm not studying, but it's less disruptive to my life in general, since my job as a bartender doesn't require a lot of mental work, and neither does going to the gym or cooking\\). \n\nI don't enjoy going out anymore, because my conscience isn't clear. I don't really enjoy the company of others right now, because I'm too busy with myself. And I lack ambition, careerwise as well as leisure\\-wise. I have money that I have been saving. I could travel, I could enjoy life when I have free time, but I don't. Instead, I work or I literally waste my time, because I've made the experience that I'm not happy with myself, that I can't enjoy things. \n\nI would like to get my degree, but I've been failing this year. I only passed 3 finals out of 9, and my parents are tired of seeing me like this, so they've announced that they'll kick me out this summer until I decide to study seriously again. I already pay for most of my stuff \\(clothes, phone, eating out, transportation, leisure, gym, etc\\) and have a considerable amount of money left each month. Also, I already have two jobs, so I'm not worried about the financial aspects that much, I could just do some more hours at my jobs and I'd be fine, I wouldn't have too much struggle paying my rent. But it would mean stopping my education \\(or only progressing very slowly, since I would lack time to study seriously\\) and being stuck with only a highschool diploma, which would leave me in a bad place in later life. \n\nAny advice on how I could get past this struggle and focus on my finals? Right now, I need a short term solutions for this month, but I'd also appreciate general advice for my situation, and what I should do if I fail my finals again. I'm opposed to taking aderall or something like this, even though the times I did take it \\(self prescribed\\), it helped me to stay focused a lot.\n\nThanks",

   "selftext": "I don't even know what to say...thank you comes to mind. This sub got the ball rolling for me and has been more helpful than any other tool that I've tried, ever. It is here that I found \"This Naked Mind\", technically the book that pushed me over the hump. Without this sub I wouldn't have found the book. I went to my first AA meeting yesterday, at 99 days sober. I don't know why, but I felt compelled to see how they go about things. I wanted to see for myself instead of letting the devout atheists of Reddit scare me into avoiding AA strictly because of one word they use.... GOD. Please, don't ever let this be a motivating factor for you if you are thinking about AA. God is not the center of AA, it is a part, and despite what some tell you there will be no christening in a lake surrounded by cultist people in robes chanting your name. These folks are just like you and they want to help you... plain and simple. I plan to go to more meetings, just for the discussion and camaraderie alone. I went to an open discussion type meeting, there was no \"our way or the highway\" mentality. I did it my way, the Annie Grace way; which is frankly in stark contrast to their way. But THAT'S OK. They want to be and stay sober, just like you and me, and however you choose to do it doesn't seem to matter (at least to the folks I met.) Honestly though, \"This Naked Mind\" did it for me. I like the idea that I have power over this, and all I needed was a change of mentality, to rid my subconscious mind of the evil subliminal advertising of the booze industry. I like that the book doesn't make you feel broken, or different. Alcohol is massively addictive to EVERYONE, not just you. You happen to be further down the slide than \"normal drinkers.\" I like the approach that alcoholism is not a disease that some people have and others don't. Alcohol is the problem, not you, plain and simple and it can be a problem for anyone if they go long and far enough down the slide. I did this for so many reasons, and my story is so long and ridiculous and frankly embarrassing, that it will need another post and probably an alt account to summarize. If you are new here - You can do this. If I can, anyone can. It's not easy...no my friends in fact it was the hardest thing I've ever done. But let me tell you it's worth it, but you won't know it until you get past 90 days. Stick with it! I am not naive enough to think I can't fail... but I have arranged my tools to succeed. I have a digital copy of TNM on me at all times, and I read this sub daily when the urge strikes. I now know that moderation is a lie, and there is absolutely no point in drinking at all. You are literally PISSING away your life and your money, for what? Ok, I'm rambling - For now, at 100 days... just a simple thank you /r/stopdrinking. ",

   "selftext": "I am very surprised this connection has not been made and will keep it short and sweet.\n\n\n---\n\n**Intro**\n\n\nAs children, we run around and exert ourselves often. I very much remember that amazing mood you are in as you are amongst your peers and still trying to catch your breath. Many of us remained active in school, high school, and even college. Notice it was generally the preps who were consistently happy and pro-active whereas the stoners/goths/punks were the low-energy sad ones?\n\n---\n\n**The true nature of chemical dependency**\n\nSo we spend our entire youths establishing the habit of endorphin chemical rush. And it is totally justified. Humans are active creatures and I don't think anyone of us will argue that it SHOULD indeed feel good to work hard. The chemical reward system is very real\n\n\n---\n\n**Alcholism**\n\nMoving into adult-hood, we've unknowingly messed up this chemical system and are able to use alcohol to achieve the same sense of reward. I do not deny that alcohol feels good as it is triggering the same chemical response as hard-work. (But I won't argue with the horribly destructive consequences)\n\n\n---\n\n**Resolution**\n\nI always disliked the coping mechanisms we give to beginners when it comes to alcoholism. When one recovering from alcoholism makes it beyond the physical aspects of the addicting, they are left with potentially a life-time of psychological addiction.\n\nI've gone for long and thoughtful walks thinking it would curve my thirst for the drink to no avail. Likewise, replacing alcohol with a non-alcoholic drink was not sufficient. And I jokingly say if someone recommends I take on some incredibly boring hobby like basket-weaving in order to 'Keep myself distracted\" then I'm going to grow depressed as I yearn for any type of meaning and reward.\n\n\n---\n\n**Reward**\n\nThat yearning for chemical reward is just as real as the alcoholism. It is not a void but a burning desire. I've found lifting weights, running. Go jogging, swimming, and pushing myself to be 100% effective.\n\nIt was only when I found this incredible link between the mind and body that I was finally able to control my drinking. Your body longs for this chemistry and you do NOT need alcohol to live it.\n\nI will not drink with you all.",

   "selftext": "I\u2019ll give a quick back story. My mother has had a tremendous rough life. She was abused as a child, I\u2019m not exactly sure to what extent but I\u2019m fairly certain sexual abuse was involved. Then she began a relationship with my father who was physically and mentally abusive. As the oldest daughter, I was her protector. She left my father when I was 10-12 years old but her alcoholism took over. I was left to care for my younger siblings, one of which was 9 years younger than me and severely neglected by my mother and has intellectual disabilities. My dad got his life together enough to care for my sister until she was 16 and that\u2019s when I took over guardianship of her. My mom was detached from her so she never had a bond. She was more like an aunt to my younger sister. As you can imagine, my mom is severely depressed and binge drinks for weeks in a dark room covered in vomit. \n\nI knew at an early age I had to get my life together and get out of my situation if I was going to make it out. There\u2019s a long line of alcoholism on both sides and I was determined to not follow suit. I was successful at doing so but that required cutting my parents out of my life and obtaining an \u2018acquaintance\u2019 like relationship. I held bday and holiday gatherings which parents would attend sober and non combative because I held zero tolerance for it and it was really nice to witness after so many years of having all holidays ruined. All 3 of my mother\u2019s children are free of alcoholism and none of us drink alcohol but I feel like that also came at a price because we had to distance ourselves and decided We will not be codependent or supportive to the disease. I knew I made the right decision when a few years ago my mom would come visit my sister to try to build on their relationship and I discovered she was stealing her prescription medication. \n\nMy mom currently lives with her sister who is an addict herself but bc it\u2019s prescription medication it\u2019s not addiction. She enables my mom and buys her alcohol. My mom has  always refused treatment or any kind of mental help. She does attend AA meetings and church but it\u2019s too severe to not seek professional help. However, with so many years of doing this she has recently taken a turn for the worse and it\u2019s almost like she is trying to kill herself by alcohol. My aunt called my hysterical that she doesn\u2019t know what to do and she is coming home to her covered in her own vomit and has not had food or water in days. She called the ambulance yesterday because my moms lips were blue. \n\nThis is what I need your help with, do I write her, call her, do nothing? You are the only one that can imagine the despair my mother feels and I\u2019m conflicted if I reach out to her at this point it will just send her over the edge. I feel like Im a trigger bc of the tremendous amount of guilt that  she couldn\u2019t do better for us and I\u2019m caring for my sister. I have never thrown that in her face bc I know how bad it hurts her that she failed us and I don\u2019t want her to carry that kind of guilt, although I\u2019m very aware the guilt is there. She\u2019s always been closed off and taught us no crying is allowed or emotions should be shown but I want to reach out to her but I\u2019m not sure what to say. I ask myself, if she dies today what would I want to say but there\u2019s so much and some things I will never say to her bc I don\u2019t want to hurt her. I want to tell her, your kids made it, we are ok, we are waiting for you, to join us and be apart of your grandchildren\u2019s lives, no questions asked. I want to share my motherhood stories with her. I want to tell her how amazing her grandson is and how great he is at baseball. I want to tell her that her granddaughter is so beautiful is almost ready to crawl. There\u2019s just so much I\u2019ve wanted to share with her and I\u2019m afraid I will never get the chance. I was my mother\u2019s protector, even in the darkest time, I stood up for her. Until one day I had to walk away.... now the time is nearly gone and I don\u2019t know the words to say to her. \n\nIf you took the time to read this, I greatly appreciate it. Please continue with your sobriety. \n",

I just had to talk about it somewhere, and I don\u2019t have people to reach out to.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 was arrested last evening for beating me. He has struggled with alcoholism for the two years that we\u2019ve been together, and I\u2019m under the impression he\u2019s struggled with it for most of his life. He has been in a medication assisted recovery program for the past few months. Last night, he relapsed and got argumentative with me. It quickly escalated into violence... he punched me repeatedly in the face, wrapped his hand around my throat and beat my head against the wall, and threw me into our tv stand. I called the police and they arrived relatively quickly and took him into custody, and informed me that they would be pressing charges. \n\nToday, I looked at the charges and they include a second degree felony of strangulation which could carry up to 10 years imprisonment. It\u2019s almost certainly wrong to feel this way, but I don\u2019t want him to face that charge. I just wanted him to calm down, and for me to be safe from whatever he was going to do in his intoxicated state. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure what advice I came here for, if any. I just needed somewhere to talk about what happened and maybe get some feedback from people who have experienced similar things.",

I just want to organize my thoughts a little about this, and I wonder if anyone can relate. \n\n\nAlcoholism and mental illness run rampant on both sides of my family, but many of us are functioning. My father is a highly successful example of this. I love him to pieces and we usually drink heavily together. He lives about a 25 hour drive away so we don't see each other often but talk weekly. I have told my mom about quitting booze but not dad, yet. \n\n\nI know deep down he will probably be supportive, but another part of me is kind of worried he will blow it off or tell me he doesn't think I have a problem. I mean, worse things could happen but I would like him to be happy for me or validate my feelings, too. We will just have to wait and see. I feel ready to share this with him now and that's enough. Plus, I'd be a fool to think this won't change our relationship at least a little. I'm noticing that I may lose a few friends over this, or at least a closeness we had when drinking. That's ok too, but it still makes me sad. I guess I'm grieving my old life a little, but my new life feels so much better.\n\n\nI love my paps no matter what, and I'm probably overthinking it!

I was a loser for most of my life up until I was 15 when I moved to a school where I met actual friends and actually got a girlfriend that I fell in love with. But I was an idiot and got kicked out of that school. And then the next one after that. Wasn\u2019t even there for a week. Parents refused to take me back. Well, my dad. Forgot to mention that at this point my mother was a dysfunctional alcoholic who had her kids taken from her and spent all her days passed out drunk on the couch in our old living room. Parents getting divorced really fucked me up when I was a kid too. Happened during the summer, and I remember first person I told on my first day at school called me a loser for it. Whaddya know. A lot of negativity in the past but I wanna make this about the present. Now, I haven\u2019t been able to get over that same girl from 3 fucking years ago and it\u2019s pathetic. Had something close to one but lost it for reasons I don\u2019t understand and can\u2019t explain. (Got ghosted). I live with my mom who has recovered from alcoholism but hasn\u2019t recovered from everything else. My apartment is a fucking disaster and I can\u2019t clean it because my mom won\u2019t let me. I\u2019m at the beginning stages of addiction/ already addicted to drugs, but I can\u2019t stop using because I just don\u2019t care anymore. I have friends, but most are hollow shells of people that only care about themselves, and the ones that aren\u2019t only want to hang out so they can get high with me. My mom has the same argument with me every month, topic could be anything outcome is the same, and tries to kick me out then 2 days later says I don\u2019t have to leave and asks me to come back. I would be gone but I have no where else to go. Now my mom in what I assume was an attempt to help me stole some of my pills to get them \u201ctested\u201d. However they were not illegal drugs and instead medication that was prescribed to me. When I confronted her, I was told to leave the house. (Haven\u2019t left yet). Then I was blamed for her crippling mental condition. Other things I\u2019ve been blamed for my all of my parental figures (step or biological) include: failure of marriage, financial issues, alcoholism, failures of other siblings, etc. I can\u2019t hold a job because I am constantly being dragged along by the Security company I work for that doesn\u2019t want to give me a paying position. Sometimes I wish I could just die, but I\u2019m too much of a p*ssy to kill myself, which I guess is a good thing. The only hope I have is a slim possibility that in 2 months I can move to a completely different state (with an old friend and one of the only real ones I have left) and start over from scratch. If I don\u2019t I have no clue what will happen\n\nI\u2019m not looking for pity. Just wanted to get this off my chest. There are always two sides to every story and I\u2019m sure I look like an evil guy on the other side. This is  just my perspective of my life, and yes it is greatly negative, but it is how I perceive it.",

And his mother\u2019s problem with drink has been getting worse lately.\n\nHis mom is single and lives in a small town and I think she gets pretty lonely. My boyfriend feels bad that he doesn\u2019t spend more time with her (he stays in my house in a different town most nights). He told me last night that he finally confronted her about it recently. I don\u2019t know that she will do anything to get help for this anytime soon.\n\nI was saying to my bf that he needs to know that he can\u2019t save her from this, it will take her wanting to get help. I meant that he shouldn\u2019t put too much pressure on himself in this situation or feel guilty in any way, and he got mad for a minute and said that I have no idea what it\u2019s like for him which is totally fair. I just want to know how I can support him in this? My heart is breaking for him, and his mother, she\u2019s a lovely and amazing person. \n\nIs there anything I can do beyond just being there for him? I feel very helpless and don\u2019t even know what I can say because it\u2019s true; I can\u2019t begin to understand how it is for him :( \n\nAlso wondering what we could do for his mom to try to get her help?\n\n\nAny advice greatly appreciated :) ",

   "selftext": "I am now 11 days sober. This is the longest dry stretch in 40 years. I am starting to believe that this will be permanent. The first few days I saddened. I felt there was nothing to look forward to in life. I was accustomed to eagerly awaiting my stiff screwdrivers every day after work.\nAs the days go by, the sadness has been eclipsed by pride. I came clean with drinking friends and my two brother in laws. They were absolutely shocked with my proclamations of alcoholism and now sobriety. There has been a huge convulsion in my social sphere. My relationships with these people are very complex. This would take pages to describe. Suffice it to say, their shock has now turned into envy or perhaps jealousy. I believe they are overwhelmed to experience someone with such conviction. Surprisingly, they are not encouraging me to drink. I hope I have inspired them to do the same. All have them have serious problems, but naturally in denial.\nI am not the type of person that gives up. If you have read my other posts you will know I am very competitive. I think my nature will not allow me to backslide and relapse. That would embarrass, if not humiliate me.\nTo make a long story short, I have this in the bag. I hope my stories will help some people. Their stories are certainly helping me.\nI really enjoy reading everyones posts. I read almost everything here, and check in several times a day. I trust this will become new behavior. \nGood luck to everyone!",

   "selftext": "I'm 36. I rarely drink if I don't party. I binge drank once every few weeks from 14~19, once every few months from 20~23, once every year from 24~27, once (or twice) a week from 28~34. \n\nWhen I went out, I would have to hit that level and take me to that place where nothing mattered and there were no consequences. Last year I started blacking out; I wouldn't remember half the night even though I was fully functional. This is when tingling in finger tips started. Also by then my hip, a toe and two knuckles started to hurt (doc said pre gout, but uric acid levels normal). I changed diet and gout went after two weeks. Tingling usually remained for two weeks IF I blacked out after binge drinking. Not every time. Also for last five years the lymph node above liver, bottom rib cage, swells and is very sore day after binge drinking.\n\nI started going out every two weeks instead. Then last July got with current steady gf. I still go out but only once every 3/4 weeks, it's a big itch/habit. A knuckle on my left hand  started randomly hurting a few months back, I guess gout has moved? I haven't felt the tingling for about a year. I usually drink a tallboy beer then 300ml Jim Beam mixed with coke, but two weeks ago had a tallboy then about 400ml vodka mixed with tonic and then cocktails in club. Blackout again. Tingling fingers again. \n\nIs this neuropathy? Is this a sign I'm drinking too much or have permanent damaged my nervous system? I had a blood check for liver 2 years ago and they said it was fine, but I've heard you don't know if you've got a liver problem until it's too late. \n\nIf you have any similar experience or advice, I would really appreciate it.

   "selftext": "So this may read like an 8th grade crush but bear with me.  There was a girl at work, she is beautiful, beautiful hair, beautiful smile, beautiful voice, everything.  I wanted so badly to talk to her and based on the countless smiles I'm guessing she wanted me to talk to her.  I'll never forget those smiles, from the 1st shining one to the last forced one, almost to say \"I've been smiling at you for 2 years why haven't you talked to me?\"  I fell in love with those smiles.  I found out yesterday she has moved on to another employer.  It crushed me, truly crushed me.  I had everything I could do to not break down in front of my coworkers.  I went home on my lunch break to cry and fought back tears the rest of the night at work and cried when I got home.  I've already broken down several times writing this.  How can I get so emotional over someone I've never said more than \"hi\" to?  Alcohol.  for 2\\+ years I've wanted so badly to talk to her, get to know her, but I knew with my drinking it would never work out.  for more than 2 years I've said \"I'll talk to her when I get sober\".  For more than 2 years I've said \"dude, your gonna live the rest of your life and wonder what could have been, for alcohol!?\".  The rest of my life is here and I no longer have the opportunity.  It's not just about a crush, it's about wondering what could have been, and about wanting something so badly and the terrible reason I never pursued it.  I've wanted to stop drinking for a long time but never really had a reason \\(you know what I mean\\).  I'll be setting up an appointment with my PCP to get a referral, wish me luck that I go through with it and luck if I do.  I want this to be the last time I spend the rest of my life wondering.",

   "selftext": "On Sunday night I posted that I was in a hotel not long after things with my qualifier (husband) had escalated to the point of calling the police so I could get my things out of our house.  \nMany of you replied, telling me to stay strong, that you were proud of me, and I want to truly thank you for being here. This is the hardest thing I've ever done, and while I feel a weight is being lifted off my shoulders, I still get hit with waves of grief, mourning what my life and marriage was supposed to be.  \n  \nNow, for updates:  \nSince I left the hotel the next morning, I went back to my house and gathered several weeks worth of clothes. My husband was even there, and in typical EtOH fashion tried asking if I needed \"help bringing stuff inside\". I told him I was there to bring stuff out to my car, that I was leaving to stay with my parents. He wasn't really surprised, just very sad. He even helped me pack. He let me take our dog, but I left the cats.  \n  \nA very difficult component of my story is that I do not have friends or family in the city we live in, and the alcoholism and relationship problems kept me from developing friendships. So I have to uproot EVERYTHING and come back to my parents', 2 states away.  \n  \n  \nAfter leaving my house with my dog &amp; things, I went to work and talked to my manager. She put me on a leave of absence and I have enough PTO to cover a month away, though she understands I'm not going to come back.  \nDuring the day on Sunday, when I knew that my husband was drinking, I was steaming with anger (still, after 3 years, you'd think my anger would decrease) so I applied for a new job in the city where my parents live.  \nWhile talking to my manager about taking leave, I received a call from the new employer asking if I'd want to interview. I set up a phone interview with HR the next day. That was yesterday and it went well, and now I'm set to interview on site early next week. \n \nI'm very lucky that I chose a field, nursing, that I can uproot my life and have an interview states away within a day. I'm very fortunate that my parents have enough resources to house me again, that they are supportive of me becoming independent again. I'm glad I never had children so that their lives were not destroyed by this also, but I also had to put children on hold because of the alcoholism.  \n  \n  \nI hope this doesn't appear as a wall of text, but I want to let ALL OF YOU know that your words mean so much, your stories are inspiring, your struggles resonate with me, and while I am sorry that we are all driven to this website for one reason or another, I am glad that we have each other.",

I\u2019m 31m and have high blood pressure, have a family history with alcoholism. He prescribed me naltrexone and asked me to take a month off. I tapered for three days before quitting on the first of May. Since then I feel pretty good but the cravings can be hard. I\u2019ve scheduled an appointment with a local organization that deals with substance abuse and provides counseling. For once in my life I have great health insurance due to my awesome new job. One of the reasons I got serious about quitting is cause I know id fuck up this job if I don\u2019t and id fuck up my relationship with my girlfriend and I just know I\u2019d get a DUI at some point if I kept it up. I can\u2019t say how ill feel at the end of the month, I\u2019m hoping I can keep it rolling and just stop for good.

I like this group more than r/stopdrinking though because it seems people are trying to do more than just simply not drink today.\n\nToday (more like this week/month) have been tough. Work, personal life, romantic life all seem like they're piling up on me, that there isn't enough time in the day, that my best efforts aren't good enough to break even let alone succeed. I've got about 14 months sober at this point, and I don't feel ask risk of drinking. What I feel is that feeling I used to drink at. I feel like I want to crawl out of my skin. Before getting sober, I didn't realize this feeling is a result of my interpretation of the world, not the actual state of the world. And I am grateful to have that distinction at my disposal now, but it still doesn't cure this feeling.\n\nWhat I do know is taking a drink won't solve this feeling. I checked off so many \"yets\" on my list after my last relapse that I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that taking a drink will not help the situation. That awareness doesn't make this feeling go away, but it does help me put it in context. \n\nTo everyone who reads this going through something like this, you are not alone, this disease is out to get you, drinking won't make the pain go away, it'll just save it (with interest) for you to experience later.",

   "selftext": "Hi guys It's been awhile but I'm feeling retrospective so I wanted to do a post. Last year on my 28th bday is when I first started to think I had a problem. I blacked out I texted my friend that took care of me the next day horribly embarrassed and telling her I thought I had a problem and she talked me off the ledge. A few months after that is when I actively started trying to quit 7 months ago I found this subreddit. I would make it like 20 ish days (or less) then fail again. Even though I thought I had a problem most people would tell me I was being dramatic except my boyfriend he was the one who really noticed. 30/40 ish days for me was the magic number. Once I passed that it's been pretty easy. I wanted to list some things that helped me so maybe if anyone is just starting out here are the things that worked for me.\n\n1. Realizing the Alcohol industry is Bullshit and they profit of your suffering.\n2. Being nice to myself and understanding drinking won't actually make me feel better.\n3. Smoking Weed People have totally understandable mixed feelings on here but in the early days when I had a craving for alcohol and it just wouldn't go away I would smoke. I haven't had a craving in over a month at this point so I haven't smoked. \n4. Enjoying whatever foods I wanted at FIRST\n5. Getting really into my health after I decided I was over junk food I'm really into Keto now. \n6. Once I got to a good place talking about it. Okay well I haven't told ppl about my problem exactly but alcoholism runs in my family which is part of why I wanted to quit. I know I'm not as bad as some of my relatives are but I don't ever want to be. Also because I'm a big health nut I've also started talking about how Alcohol is a horrible deadly poison and the FDA plays down the risk because the Alcohol Lobbiest wanna make money. I'm real fun at parties. lol. Luckily all my friends have been pretty cool with it a lot of us are in our late 20s and trying to get healthy in various ways before we hit 30 so luckily it hasn't been a big deal.\n\nThe only worry I have right now is I do have one friend who is pressurer. (Last time we hung out he was trying to pressure my friend that had an hour drive home to take a shot and I had to intervine and be like come on man. He's working on not doing it as much cuz we've told him how annoying it is) Anyways for my bday were doing a Movie night at him and his wifes house. They actually were the first friends I opened up with about my drinking so hopefully he doesn't forget cuz he might try to get me to drink but I'm bringing my bf as a support. (most of my friends in that group don't drink) \n\nAnyways thanks guys for all your advice and encouragement! I will not drink with you tonight! ",

   "selftext": "Yesterday, I experienced a nervous breakdown. It wasn't my first, I could see it coming from a long ways off. Facing a failing relationship, feeling as if my words don't matter, and that I'm a burden to everyone I love, I went to a place where I go to have a drink and enjoy a view on the edge of town. I did have my handgun with me, but I didn't think of using it. \n\nAfter a few drinks, I decided I needed to talk to somebody. I had talked to my family, and even if they were supportive, I felt going back to them would be too bothersome. In the past, I'd always been told I was fine, that nothing was wrong with me, and that I was making a fool out of myself for saying I had a problem. So I decided to call the Veterans Crisis Hotline. \n\nIn the Marine Corps, we're trained to toughen up and be ready to kill at all times. There was no time for negative emotions such as grief or depression, only anger to drive us forward. I was sent to Afghanistan less than a year of signing up. \n\nAfter a few months, I was to be up a minimum of 15 hours a day. In reality, I would go a couple days without more than an hour rest. I was tired, I kept messing up, I was depressed, but my job needed to be done. After sleeping in one too many times, I saw I was a detriment to my unit, and decided I needed to take myself out of the equation. I spent three hours trying to muster up the courage to pull that trigger, but the next Marine to take post arrived, and I told him everything. \n\nHalf a year later, I was medically discharged from the military. I hadn't even spent two years in the military, and I had yet to even accomplish anything. There's not been a day that goes by that I don't think about how things could've turned out if I did things differently. This made my depression worse, and alcoholism took hold of me quickly, and it's held on for 4 years now. \n\nI also had a failing relationship, and still do. We've been together almost six years, yet the past year, we've talked less and less to each other. She's constantly on her phone, she only talks about her field of work, and when I talk about something, anything I find interesting, I receive a reply of only a few words, usually just a bullshit, ill-planned reply. I wake up thinking every day will be different, that it'll be better. But it hasn't. \n\nI've told my SO about how I'm feeling, and despite her efforts and sweet personality, she told me she didn't know how to deal with me and I needed to get help elsewhere. I tried to get help, but every attempt failed for one reason or another. Even the simplest issues would cause immense stress, and the stress of all these problems and obligations built up, and I knew I had to do something quick. \n\nAfter a few drinks by myself on a lonely hillside, I decided I needed to call the crisis hotline. After two hours of talking and requesting additional help, the emergency services arrived. I was relieved I would at least get some help. A SWAT team truck and about seven cruisers showed up. Though I was getting help, it felt like I was getting punished. Every minor detail I missed or got wrong, I was called a liar and other names, and threatened with charges of resisting arrest and impeding and investigation. I just stuck to my military manner and spoke only when spoken to. The only officer that treated me like a human was my driver, and I greatly appreciate her help. \n\nI spent the night in the psych ward. I was tired, but I couldn't sleep. A schizophrenic man laughter the whole night and I would wake up after a brief moment of sleep to him screaming obscenities at the staff and people that weren't there. It was a very long night. \n\nI was discharged today. Still facing my problems, I'm not out of the woods, I've only gotten deeper. But now I know a direction to go in to help me recover and accomplish my goals. I still have many hard decisions to make, but I have hope that I can carry forward. Thank you for your time.",

We had been friends probably five months before but he was going through a 6 year abusive relationship at this point, if that matters to the story. Other than the chemistry we had, our drinking problem brought us together because we could relate. I guess thought maybe we could help each other.

I guess that's fine, he will hopefully get sober on his own time. My life isnt his life. My problem is the hiding and lying he does about the drinking. I'll ask if he has,drank today, already knowing and he will tell me no he hasn't. He will eventually confess that yeah, he did. But its the lying about it. Just WHY!?  Claims he cares about me but thats disrespectful. He thinks he doesn't have a problem since he was once two years sober he can control it now. He's lied four times to me about it in the past two weeks. I'm torn between helping because of my alcoholism or acknowledge the red flags now and walk away. I don't know what to do. ",

Yes, I call myself a boy, 'cause of the state I'm now I'm a little boy, suffering, begging for help and an end for the suffering. I'm a lawyer, graduated last year. So, I started drinking when I was 13 years, hidden of course, and it was fine until 15. When I smoked pot, got panic attack, developed panic disorder, dp/dr(derealization/depersonalization), anxiety stuff. I went sober then, and went to meds and benzos(&lt;---fuck benzos)\n\nI managed somehow to control my attacks without benzos, I *ONLY*(not meant to be used daily, but my doctor said it was not a problem) took them for sleep since 2011. Not anymore. GABA receptors were being attacked them. I started drinking again in 2013, when I got panic under control, just DR/DP left. And I fucking found that drinking relivied it. So I drank like 3-5 times a week, until I went 5-7 a week or the maximum I went, 18 days straight fucking binge drinking.\n\nNow, a former lawyer, no more university, I have no job, I'm housebound, I'm going to lose my driver license because I was caught driving under the influence of alcohol (not drunk, different things ok? Here in Brazil, low concentrations are influences only, like 2, 3 beers.) I'm also addicted to a benzodiazepine called Clonazepam.\n\nHere my \"sober\" story starts. I take this drug everyday. 0.5mg, when I do not drink. 1mg-3mg mg when I'm hangover (glutamate rebound and doc. said it was ok, they have no clue, it's not), but then I was 6 days today without drinking and FUCK. I couldn't stand. I'm not a weak \"boy\". I had tremors, shaking, DP/DR, anxiety, almost a full blown panic attack, I just didn't panic because I knew this was the alcohol withdrawal. I thought \"Victor, this is your 6th day without drinking in YEARS. It's a body reaction.\" And I drank 5 long neck beers today to ease me, and now I'm going to sleep with the aid of clonazpeam.I don't want to be ALCOHOL FREE forever, I know for a while I will be, But, I don't know how to do it. I have the willpower to not drink when I don't. I know I fucked up with binge drinking during 5 years. But I think I can't do it cold turkey, too much suffering, too much pain, too much HELL. Moderation is the key, I should listened that years ago... thx guys.\n\nI just need some non cold-turkey schedule for this.\n",

   "selftext": "**Introduction**\n\nI want to preface this post by saying that do not consider myself an alcoholic. What I mean by that \u2013 definition semantics aside \u2013 is that based on the stories about alcoholism I have read on this sub-Reddit (or elsewhere on the internet for that matter) my story does not compare to the incredible struggle people have with alcohol in their lives. In a sense I am very lucky with how relatively little my use of alcohol has impacted my life so far. However, this is also exactly the reason for me to write the post you are about to read. The point that I want to make is that for me alcohol has gone from an exciting social lubricant to a depressing social staple and that I\u2019ve had enough.\n\n\n\n**Background**\n\nSo to outline where I am coming from (literally and figuratively) here is my background. I was born in 1989 and grew up in the South of the Netherlands. Now what is important to know is that in this part of my country (or any rural part of the Netherlands for that matter) alcohol is (ab)used from a very young age on a very widespread scale. I grew up in a very normal working class family although most of my friends came from much more affluent families.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis meant that I was exposed to heavy drinking (mostly by my immediate family) from a very young age and that I myself started drinking from the age of 14 (the legal drinking age in the Netherlands was 16 at the time). And when I say started drinking I am not talking about half of a glass of wine at the dinner table or a sip of beer at a party but truly binge-like drinking. \n\n\nBetween the age of 14 and 18 I drank heavily (meaning I got drunk) at least twice a week. It is important to note that this was considered completely normal behavior at the time (although in hindsight it really wasn\u2019t), especially when you consider that all of this drinking sessions where very social events (pre-gaming, birthdays, house parties etc. So no lonely drinking sessions or anything like this).\n\n\nThis pattern continued and flourished during my time in law school (18-24) when drinking 3-4 days a week became the norm. Between parties at the student organization I was a member of and going out with my friends I was basically living from one occasion to drink to another. Again this was considered completely normal when looking at my social surroundings at the time (student culture in the Netherlands is very focused on alcohol in general).\n\n\nAfter finishing law school I joined a prestigious law firm where I was basically surround by alpha-type people who all subscribed (or at least pretended to subscribe) to a work hard/play hard lifestyle and happily played my part in all of this. Especially in the first two years of my career I would drink 2-3 times a week. What played a big role here for me is that drinking was extremely intertwined with work. There was a bar at the firm hosting free Friday afternoon drinks to blow off the steam of what was an extremely challenging professional setting. On top of this you had all kinds of networking events you were supposed to attend. In addition to this I would still have drinks with friends outside of work to keep a semblance of a social life afloat.\n\n\nAfter 2,5 years of being a lawyer (I mainly did real estate and M&amp;A transactions) I decided this was not the life for me and I switched to a position and commercial real estate fund. This ushered a change in my drinking behavior as well as I did not feel the need to drink as much as I did when I was working at the law firm (I could probably write a standalone post on the insidiousness of peer pressure but I will leave that for another day). During this period I  got tipsy/drunk maybe once a week (usually on Fridays) and I had a few drinks on Saturday and Sunday but nothing excessive. Part of this was that I was nearing the end of my twenties and really noticed that the after-effects of drinking became much worse. In other words the hangovers became much more brutal.\n\n\n\n**Lifestyle changes**\n\nRecently there have been a few major changes in my life that I think contributed greatly to my motivation to stop drinking (which I will go into later on). \n\n\nThe first major change is that I started a ketogenic diet as of January. For people who have no idea what this means it is basically a diet where you eat almost no carbohydrates and primarily sustain yourself with fatty foods (80%) and protein rich foods (20%). \n\n\nThe reason that I mention this is that alcoholic drinks often contain a lot of sugar (i.e. carbs) so this meant that while following the diet I would have to keep my alcohol consumption in check (or at least be picky with my drinks). In practice this meant I started drinking more white wine as opposed to beer but as wine still contains quite a lot of sugar I usually switched to hard liquor after a few glasses.\n\n\nNow a lot of people on the ketogenic diet (e.g. /r/ketodrunk) will argue that drinking alcohol is fine as long as you choose the right drinks and they are right for the most part but what I noticed while drinking in ketosis is that the way you get drunk is just less fun. Instead of the giddiness you feel when drinking a lot of (sugary) drinks I usually felt mellow and numbed. Not a state I particularly enjoy (especially given the hangovers that ketosis apparently exacerbates).\n\n\nThe second major change in my life is the fact that I moved to Paris in February for work. My new job involves a crazy amount of travelling by plane and I noticed that I just couldn\u2019t afford to even have a few drinks the evening before let\u2019s say a 7am flight as it would wreck me the next day. That combined with the fact that my new social circle in Paris (however small it might still be) doesn\u2019t know me as a guy who likes to drink makes it easier for me to just not do it (in other words: I haven\u2019t formed any \u2018drinking habits\u2019 yet in Paris, so why start?).\n\n\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThis brings me to my reasons for stopping drinking all together. My most obvious reason is that most of the time (epic moments aside) the price I have pay just doesn\u2019t stack up against the rewards. What I mean by this is that most times that I have a drink these days I don\u2019t really enjoy it as much as I used to (this might also be partly cause by the abovementioned diet). On the other hand I feel increasingly lethargic and borderline depressed when I drink even moderately (let alone excessively) in addition to the usual hangover symptoms.\n\n\nNow the question I have struggled with recently is: why is this bothering me now whereas in the past I happily paid the price for a good binge?\n\n\nWhat I managed to come up with so far is mainly that at this stage in my life I want different things for myself. I am very ambitious when it comes to my career and although I did just fine (all things considered) while still drinking casually I feel like I am missing a gear even when I am drinking just moderately. Also outside of work there are so many things I want to achieve (learn French, sports, reading, travel etc.) and friendships that I want to develop that I feel would suffer if I kept drinking casually. \n\n\nThis brings me to my more intrinsic motivation to stop drinking all together: self-worth. For me the worst side-effect of alcohol is by far how it erodes my self-discipline and subsequently how I feel about myself.\n\n\nJust to give an example: often I used to fully intend to go for a run on Saturday morning but would nevertheless have up to 10 drinks on a Friday evening. The next morning I would either (i) force myself to run, hating every minute of it (and myself for drinking so much); or (ii) stay in bed, watch Netflix and hate myself for not going for a run. \n\n\nNow you could say I shouldn\u2019t be so tough on myself and that it is no problem to let loose once in a while but the more I think about this argument the more it feels like an excuse to just give in to temptation and to use the words of Jocko Willink (who I think is extremely inspiring): \u2018discipline equals freedom\u2019 and freedom is extremely important to me.\n\n\n\n**Challenges** \n\nCurrently I am five weeks in and my biggest challenge so far has been by far social pressure. I am baffled by the responses I get when I tell friends I don\u2019t drink. From \u2018why, do you have an alcohol problem?\u2019 to \u2018not you as well with this hipster health shit?\u2019. \n\n\nA few of the responses have been supporting in nature but the overwhelming majority have been critical to say the least. This probably says a lot about my social circle (are my friends \u2018true friends\u2019 or just \u2018drinking buddies\u2019?) but what bothers me the most is that alcohol usage is so incredibly normalized that when you don\u2019t drink you are the outlier and not the guys slurring their speech and pissing in public.\n\n\nA second, more long-term challenge, is that I  might just find it easier to start drinking again. As I have never hit rock-bottom I can already hear that voice in my head saying \u2018it is ok, you have everything under control, just one night of going hard won\u2019t kill you\u2019. And the voice would probably be right, it won\u2019t kill me but it would keep me from reaching my goals (sooner rather than later).\n\n\n\n**Way forward**\n\nSo this journey for me has only just started. After five weeks I am still struggling to hold my own during social events where everyone is imbibing. Fortunately I am mentally in a very strong place right now so I am confident I will keep at it for the foreseeable future. I am already fully enjoying the short term perks of not drinking (no hangovers, I am sleeping better, I am more stable emotionally and have more energy to just name a few) and what I am looking forward to is the long term benefits. \n\n\nTo look back in 10 years and think of all the things I managed to do with the time I was not hung-over or drunk. Whether it regards my career, my hobbies or my friends and family I am sure not drinking will have a positive effect one way or another. What I am not looking forward to is losing friends that turn out to just be \u2018drinking buddies\u2019 but the most important thing is that I am willing to find out.\n\n\nI wanted to share this story with you all to see if there are others that find themselves similarly motivated to stop drinking and to hear your stories. \n\n\t\n",

   "selftext": "**TLDR - The over glorification of mental disorders as of late are seriously harming the people's perspective about mental disorders as it seriously dumps down the seriousness of these mental disorders, let alone the unique individual experiences among different mental disorders, even if you have people who exhibit the same symptoms of a certain mental disorder (if you have two people with depression, you cannot treat them the same because the impact of that certain disorder are completely different and unique for those specific respective individuals)**\n\nSo there seems to be a double standard nowadays when it comes to the subject of mental illnesses.\n\nOn one hand, the stigma about mental illnesses are still there, whether it is used for literary purposes such as in comic book stories, the villains are often regarded as psychotic, maniacal or sadistic which are stereotypical words to address the mentally ill (which is fine as a literary concept because they can be good stories) and this kind of stigma also exists in the real world in so many ways - some people still use religion as a defence or an explanation for certain mental illnesses (especially the ones that not many are aware of or much strange to comprehend), there are still ideas about mental illnesses that are not really understood like telling someone with depression to get over it (or perhaps people do it because they do not know how to react to that situation), or some people think that eating disorders like anorexia is a habit or a choice considering that there are pro-anorexia articles and even stories of people managing to change their lives with unorthodox methods that could seriously damage their body or their mind but somehow managed to walk away unscaved\n\n*(and to be perfectly honest, this taboo has been so intertwined and so deeply integreted in many cultures and many forms of mainstream thought for generations that I do not think that the stigma will go away. Even me, a psychology graduate, despite that I want to refrain from judging or stigmatising anyone with a mental disorder, my unconscious instinctively tells me to walk away from them or not to contact them as if I was repeatedly told that these people are weird and the weird must be too much to understand so it is often a conscious battle for me to avoid this impulse)*\n\nOn the other hand, I am noticing a slow trend of the more positive portrayals of those with mental disorders -\n\nThere are tons of more positive or at least less-demonising portrayals of people with mental disorders or in fact of people without any clear diagnosis of a certain mental disorder but just people with their own problems like \n\n- Good Will Hunting\n\n- the portrayals of  certain superheroes like Batman who happens to have his own mental disorders and mental troubles, Ironman who struggled with alcoholism, Spiderman who sometimes suffers from depression and PTSD and so on\n\n- The Perks of Being a Wallflower\n\n- In Treatment TV series\n\n- A Beautiful Mind \n\nAnd there are many others out there that portray those with mental disorders in a more humanising way.\n\n*(NOTE - Bear in mind that the concept of mental disorders is extremely difficult and complicated. While some symptoms are clear for certain disorders, sometimes to distinction between a mental disorder or \"normal\" human behaviour is not very clear. Plus, what we define as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" is not objective and this led to some misconceptions or mistakes or even misdiagnosis as well. Like for Thomas Zsazs and his argument against mental illnesses and the Rosenhan experiment)*\n\nHowever, as much as I like this portrayal - **I am really f%$king tired of the over-glorification of this portrayal**\n\nFor starters, there is a **BIG DIFFERENCE** between empowerment and glorification. \n\n*(because most of these disorders cannot be actually \"cured\" but mostly treated. You have to learn to live with your demons or become above them in some way instead of completely eliminating them because your \"demons\" can come up with so many ways and we mostly do not get rid of them entirely)*\n\nYes, we need to empower these people and let me know how to live along with their own personal struggles and treating people with mental disorders is often hard, complex and takes time because there are often many different factors working together, sometimes factors that the therapist is not even aware of or the client does not mention until long after the first session, and there are often different methods to treat certain disorders, even the most common ones \n\nAnd also some disorders are not given the same recognition as other disorders as either they are very rare or are not given the enough attention or budgets to be researched or beacuse of taboo because some social circles have more collective views that seriously hinder or even influence the concept of mental illnesses such as more collective social groups such as Asian countries such as academic success is incredibly strict and scary in Asian countries like Japan and South Korea and this slowly increases students' anxiety levels, fear of failure, fear of being inadequate or shunned if they fail or do not mean expectations, and even the likelihood to commit suicide because they are unable to process or resist or tackle all the anxiety they are experiencing and find it too hard to handle, or because they failed a test and find the failure so overboaring with fear and negative emotions that they feel that there is no hope for them and feel that the only way out is to commit suicide and avoid a lifetime of shame -\n\n **that is seriously f%$ked up and a pattern of behaviour with little oppurtunities to counter these factors because they often reinforce each other like a complex system or structure that goes full circle**\n\n\n\nHowever, if you over-glorify these people who exhibit these symptoms and struggles, **you are completely eliminating the struggle part of this phenomenon**\n\nI see this mostly when it comes to the portrayal of those with autism and there is a sudden rise of interest of treating and researching the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) because there are so much that we do not really know for sure how ASD develops and what exactly causes someone to develop ASD or how the brain works with someone with ASD or shows symptoms of a pattern involving ASD against someone who does not.\n\nFine, some people with ASD are very bright. They will exhibit unbelievable amount of interest in certain things (what people would call Asperger's which is now mostly considered as high-functioning autism) and maybe their own unorthodox thoughts can exhibit their own creative manners of creativity as those with ASD are extremely rigid in thinking (kinda like someone with OCD but those with ASD really do not like change to this consciously) and cannot understand others' perspectives (lack of theory of mind)\n\nHowever, those with ASD can be really, really, really annoying.\n\nThey can be loud, annoying, sometimes even physical or emotionally abusive and it takes an enormous amount of discipline for parents and therapists to handle and treat these people with this kind of condition\n\nWhat about the portrayal of other things such as depression and anxiety? These are the most common disorders in the world and every single person who displays certain symptoms of these two disorders are affected in their own way (because one of them is a mood disorder and can potentially be very personal to the person, the other is an anxiety disorder which can also be very personal especially when it comes to threatening stimuli)\n\nAnd yet, the portrayal so far about these (whether it is by the media or people who talk about these on social media), either they are glorified to the point that they neglect the seriousness of these disorders, or the normalise this disorder so much because of how common they are (almost like the common cold) and minimise the seriousness of these symptoms (almost like being with depression is like having a bad day instead of the more apathetic and gloomy form of emotion, or having an anxiety attack or a panic attack is regarded similarly to being stressed in a more \"normal\" manner)\n\n(even lately when someone says something about a certain psychological phenomenon, they will either try to bash it as if they are psychology experts when not even me can even mention my own opinion because I am only a psychology graduate; or they are often over-glorified as if they are taking advice from a guru like for example lately the clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson has increased in popularity lately (among other things that he talks about) and many people have different opinions about what he says and his expertise but many people often take his word like it is a the word of God and that is seriously damaging because it goes a lot against of how therapy sessions work because the therapist is meant to be a guide, a person who can give you the way on how to think and NOT what to think)*\n\nOr even lately where those with mental disorders are often regarded as creative artists like painters or film makers (taking inspiration from the Troubled Artist archetype like Van Gogh). While it is true somewhat that some people with mental disorders actually are able to develop creative forms of art as a form of therapy as art therapy actually exists and is quite effective, that does **NOT** necessarily mean that those with mental disorders will eventually become artists or those that do not have mental disorders do not have the ability to become great artists.\n\nYes, for some reason, some people managed to a sense of awe within their mental disorders.\n\nSome people use it to develop some forms of art, some people use it to help others, some people use it as inspiration or drive for other goals.\n\nJust because there are people who do not exhibit the most common of mental disorders, it does not mean that they are lacking in their ability to do something or at least something meaningful. \n\nJust because you have a mental disorder such as depression, does not necessarily mean that you will eventually be a good artist (unless you want to) and just because you do not have a mental disorder (or at least was not diagnosed with one), does not mean that you are not able to do a good job or do not have the inspiration or drive to develop something meaningful or impactful like art\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo I think you understand what I am saying here.\n\nThere is a pattern of a double-edge sword when it comes to the portrayals of this phenomenon.\n\nOn one hand, there is still the usual portrayal of mental illness as mostly a common plot element for many crime shows or horror flicks *(well, except for the American Psycho film as its portrayal has its own themes)*.\n\nOn the other hand, while there are efforts to help people realise that those with mental disorders are human as well, most portrayals of late are used so often and used as a plot device as a more of an \"excuse\" for how certain characters behave, it gives viewers the wrong impression about mental disorders as well",

   "selftext": "I don't know why I can't stop doing this to myself... (Sorry, this is going to be a pretty long post, but thank you in advance to anyone who will take the time to read it.)\n\nI had last drunk a week ago (Thursday 3rd May) and then been sober for three days. So Monday was day 4, and my anxiety was through the roof. (I've already learnt that days 3 and 4 tend to be when your anxiety reaches it peak.) It was probably the worst *psychological* withdrawal I've experienced so far, I felt like crying all the time. (Physically I was pretty much ok, apart from terrible fatigue.) I had to go to work although I felt completely unable to function normally. But somehow I managed to get things done...\n\nOK, I so then it's Tuesday (the day before yesterday) and day 5. I weak up feeling **normal** again. The sense of relief... it's always so wonderful. But what do I decide to do on Tuesday afternoon/evening, after my psychoanalysis (when I often feel upset because of the tough things that are discussed there)? Something inside me convices me that it'll be a good idea to buy two bottles of wine. So I do that (and I've eaten very little all day). I have a great time drinking and drawing that night (https://redd.it/8dvbyg), and I stay up until 5 a.m. Not that I intend to, but you know how time just flies when you're wasted and doing something you enjoy...\n\nThen it's Wednesday (yesterday). I wake up around noon feeling **terrible**. I nearly faint on my way to the kitchen to get some water. I mostly stay in bed until 5 p.m., not really sleeping, just dozing off  for brief moments every now and then. Then I finally get up and feel sort of okayish (apart from a headache) for a couple of hours, and I already think the worst is over. But then comes the **nausea**. Now I haven't eaten anything all day (no apetite), I've only been drinking sports drinks to rehydrate myself. But I end up vomiting several times that evening and still during the night (last night). Although there is nothing but a little liquid inside my stomach. I stay awake most of the night, unable to fall asleep, although I've taken as much medication as I've dared. Also, I keep sweating and shivering from cold at the same time. **Now** (it's afternoon in my timezone) I'm finally sort of ok again.\n\nI'm confident I won't drink today; alcohol repulses me right now (after how sick I've been). But I'm going out to dinner with friends tomorrow night and I am **so scared** of what may happen. They are my best friends and I don't \"need\" alcohol to feel relaxed around them. But I know they will all be drinking, probably sparkling wine and wine. (They are all moderate drinkers.) I'm so worried the temptation will be too much for me... I haven't seen them in a while, so I really want to go. If only I could just stick to drinking non-alcoholic drinks...\n\nI've started to feel so helpless over alcohol that I often find myself thinking what illness I'd rather take than alcoholism if I had to have one and I could choose. And diseases like diabetes come to my mind... I don't mean to offend any diabetics here (I know diabetes is a serious illness), but this just shows how desperate I am. I honestly fear I will never recover from this.",

   "selftext": "I have fallen back into a dark, unforgiving place. This is the only place I trust to at least hear me out. \n\nI feel so fucking alone. I feel like there are walls that are closing in on me. \n\nI thought finally leaving home, leaving behind a fractitious home, a miserable high school experience, and all of my inner demons that haunted me for college would be one of the most liberating things to happen to me. I feel like I am wrong now. \n\nA bit of background:\nMy parents never got along. Been together since they were teenagers. Growing up, seeing the constant fights and verbal viritol became commonplace. Shit rolls downhill. Throughout my adolscelent years, up until my senior year of high school it was all piled on me. Its my fault that \"parent1/parent2\" suffers. , \"I am a quiet loser who will die alone.\" and a whole bunch of other fun shite. I also got mugs, glass, the whole nine thrown at me. I got into fistfights with my alcoholic father at the height of it. It fucking sucked. For the better of the family, both of my parents have seperated and are awaiting a official divorce, a bittersweet revelation, but certainly for the best. I fucking hated them, but time heals, I guess? \n\nShit back home got to me in high school. I am a natural introvert. I am quiet and like to keep to myself or a very small, but tight knit group of friends, if I could even call it that. Evidently, I had a hard time making friends, not the best socially. Even the \"friends\" I did make seemed to only befriend me out of pity. I did do well academically, and got into a solid school for engineering. All that shit back home, being alone at school, made me yearn to leave for college and leave that superficial, stuck up, fake ass pretentious dump behind.\n\nI will concede, the switch to college has been a slight improvement. I tried to force myself to get out there and try new things, meet new people. Yet, to no avail. \n\nI try not to let it bother me, but I cant help to admit that it does make me a bit envious to see others look so happy, bright, and full of life, and when I try to input or something, the same blank, disintrested, and slightly annoyed look I get from everyone. \n\nSchools been shit, too. I am on academic probation this quarter after failing a few classes, something new to me, as before college I never failed a class before. Going from a 3.8+ GPA to barely keeping your head up above 2 is fucking demoralizing. No matter how much I put in the effort to improve, same fucking result. \n\nI mentioned my parents are divorcing right ? \n\nI catch up with my mom, who has moved to  Nevada with my sisters, in my college town as it was on the way back from their visit. The look on her face killed me. Red eyes, with tears streaming down her face, lamenting on her fights with my narcasistic grandmother, sister, and sporadic phone arguments with my pops. I talked to him recently too. Sounded happier than usual to hear from me. Skin is turning yellow and frail from his long rampant alcoholism and as much of an ass he was, He was on the verge of tears about how lonely he is, etc. \n\nMy roomates are two of the most friendly people I have met, and our friendship or what seems to be one looks to be in place well beyond college. They get along better than I do with them though, \"You're just different man, dont sweat it.\" Lighthearted banter, especially about how I cant make other friends, get a girlfriend, and all the other run of the mill BS hits deep taking into account the afformentioned stuff. \n\nI dont click with anyone nor seem to fit in anywhere, oftentimes like back in high school, I find myself unable to sleep or quietly crying myself to sleep, not being able to force myself out of bed till midday, because of my isolation. My family is too far away from me to reach out to, and too far for me to be able to help them through their struggles.I am  fucking alone here and it fucking kills me inside. I battle with frequent fluctuations of grief,sadness, anger/rage, and relative indifference. The best part is when people who didnt give half a shit about you before feel like coming up to you now to ask \"everything ok man?\" They don't really care to hear me out  they just want the gratification. I have no true friends, and its feeding into the depression and pressure to succeed\n It sucks being alone. Some reassurance or even the smallest kind gesture, like a hug would go a long way right now. \n",

   "selftext": "I posted a long story not too long ago about why I decided to quit drinking again. \n\nThe first time I quit, last year, I did so for eight months and I didn't really take it seriously as \"alcoholism\". I had decided my problem wasn't alcohol *per se* just that it was exacerbating my own emotional instability. \n\nI went to AA meetings when I first quit and it didn't really connect with me. I listened to other people's stories and I thought, \"well, I don't have that physical compulsion to drink, I must not be an alcoholic.\" I still abstained and I did so for eight months. I was fine going to bars, being around friends drinking etc without feeling the need to drink. \n\nOf course, it turned out that regardless of whether I have that compulsion, it's the risk of what I could turn into when I drink that is the problem. \n\nI am taking my alcoholism an order of magnitude more seriously this time around. I've been to AA meetings almost every single day for the last 18 days. I've opened my ears and unlike the last time I am actually hearing stories that resonate with me of which I can relate. I have shared at most of them. A lot of it is repetition but saying stuff out loud over and over again helps me come to terms with myself. I have met people and exchanged phone numbers and I am slowly developing a network. I still haven't started the steps, I don't have a sponsor or a home group, but I am taking my time. \n\nIt's broken me out of my rationalization and justification for certain beliefs I had about interpersonal relationships, love and romance. Where before when I quit drinking I was still stubbornly holding on to certain resentments and beliefs about how I was slighted, I have finally opened my eyes to how perceivably dangerous and scary my behavior is to other people especially women. \n\nI have lost a lot of friends many of whom I probably won't be able to make amends with for a very long time, but I have others who have stuck by me and who want to see me get better. Who believe me in despite how I acted. \n\nI am trying so fucking hard.",

   "selftext": "My mother's boyfriend is an alcoholic, and has been pretty much since they started dating. He has experienced very devastating things as a child and has tried to sober up many times, unsuccesfully. My mom has a very low tolerance of stress, and she's been a nervous wreck for a year now. They lives together for 9 months but my mom moved out after realising that he won't sober up no matter what. He has lost contact with his two young sons from his last marriage, and he's pretty much in a constant state of heavy grief all the time. We've tried to be there for him, since he is a weak man, but nothing has come of it.\n\nNow my patience has run out since this is my last year as a teen living my old way of life before going to the army, and I don't want to lose another year of my life trying to help a lost cause. I demanded that he try sobering up himself without our help, since our help hasn't worked before, or else they break up. My mom agreed.\n\nIs it wrong to ask him to get a grip by himself, especially when he really has regressed from his old self? My mom is the only thing left in his life, but I'm afraid that he'll take her with him too if this continues any longer. He's been to AA many times but he refuses to go to rehab. \n\nI know this is harsh, but my mom is a teacher and has a puppy at home now and she has no time to relax with him coming over to her place even when she doesn't want him there, so she's been chronically tired even after she moved out .\n\nSo, am I doing the wrong or the right thing?

Things are great most of the time. \n\nThe biggest issue is, he gets angry when he drinks.  Most of our fights have occurred while one of us has been drinking. I mostly drink two drinks tops, I know my limit. It\u2019s getting to the point where I think I might have to take a break from alcohol just so I don\u2019t encourage him to drink.  I barely drink to begin with, so cutting it out wouldn\u2019t be difficult for me. \n\nLast week we got into a fight while we both were drinking. It was over a joke, he thought I was making fun of him and it escalated from there. Today, I tried talking to him about it. I said \u201cI don\u2019t want to drink anymore, I don\u2019t like the people we are when we drink. We always fight and it hurts me\u201d.

   "selftext": "Hello to everyone on this incredible forum. \n\nLike lots of people on here, I\u2019m sure, I feel very scared to write this. I lurked on this forum constantly about two months ago, during which time I quit drinking for around twenty days, before it all collapsed. The community here is the one of the most special things I think I\u2019ve ever seen and I\u2019m grateful for everyone out here doing what they do.  \n\nI\u2019m here because I know deep down in my heart that I have a very big drinking problem. I have tried my best to ignore it for as long as I possibly could as I work in the drinks trade \\(I am, in fact, sat within a wall of beer at work right now\\) but I am a problem drinker and there is no way for me to hide from it anymore. \n\nDrinking has been a very prominent part of my life for as long as I can remember. My dad passed away in my teens due to alcoholism. He was never really seen without a drink, although I never really considered that unusual as it was all I had known for him, and we spent many a happy weekend\\-afternoon running around beer gardens as children. My mum drinks pretty much daily, not heavily by any stretch of the imagination, but a drink at the end of a long day has been burned into my cranium as the adult treat that everyone gets to enjoy. As a teenager I started drinking relatively heavily with friends as we navigated the new pastures of being able to get past the bouncers guarding the doors of the bars and clubs in town. It was fun then, and not being able to recall the events of the previous evening was part and parcel of the experience, I thought. I noticed others not wanting to play as hard as I did, but I thought they had low tolerances and I wore my own high tolerance like a badge of honour. As I entered my twenties I continued to be the last girl standing, even if I was staggering more than standing. I started working in bars when I was in my late twenties, and arriving so late to the industry game meant that I had a lot of catching up to do. Free post\\-shift drinks were a starter pistol and I walked home as the sun came up more often than I care to remember, and often I couldn\u2019t. \n\nWhilst working in bars I met the love of my life. We were both in other relationships at the time but when we talked and got to know each other we fell more deeply in love than I had ever considered possible. Naturally, this brought an end to both of our relationships and we embarked on a love affair that has brought me joy beyond my wildest dreams. For better or for worse, though, we are both big drinkers who love nothing more than unwinding with a beautiful beer. When drinking together is good we have the time of our lives, laughing and joking and making love and seeing the world through rose\\-tinted glasses. When bad, we fight and scream until we\u2019re blue in the face, and awake the next morning hungover and regretful. \n\nI know in my heart that most of our drinking\\-related problems are caused by my inability to stop once I have started. More than that, I become deeply insecure when drunk and lash out at him because of a deep\\-seated fear that he will walk away from me. The irony of drinking myself into oblivion, and then verbally attacking my true love or at the very least needing him to walk me home as I weigh heavy on his arm so that he *doesn\u2019t* leave me isn\u2019t lost. I think often about the lust for life I gave him when I handed him my heart and then about the shattering disappointment he must feel now that he finds himself with a girl who sold him a lie. Because when we fell in love we stayed up until dawn drinking, but that was supposed to end. We were supposed to build a life together and clean up our act and whilst he does everything he can to live a clean and healthy life, he is brought back down by me and my insatiable thirst. I am his enabler, and all I ever wanted to do was nurture him; like pouring a pint of beer on a houseplant then stubbing a cigarette end out in the soil.\n\nLast night we met up for drinks after a very stressful day. My boy has gone away today for the weekend, so goodbye drinks seemed like the perfect way to spend the evening. With empty stomachs we charged forth, which lead to heated bickering and soon arguing. Bowing under the weight of the day\u2019s earlier struggles, I turned to my glass instead of my boy for comfort. I soon lapped him and when his frustrations rightly got the better of him he stood up to leave. Four or five pints had unshackled my inhibitions and I grabbed him and flailed at him and tried to stop him from walking away. He pushed me off and because I had drank so much I fell to the floor and into a group of people. He left and I cried on the shoulder of a person with a face I can\u2019t recall. I stumbled off on a fifteen minute walk that must have taken thirty and when a car drove by and offered to take me home I did the stupidest thing I have ever done and got in. When I woke up I knew I was technically safe and unharmed, despite not recalling much of anything since I had fallen. I have done this enough to know how to reassure myself. My things were there, my keys and my clothes, I checked my body for bruises, but I don\u2019t know how to check how much damage I did to my soul, or how to check my boy\u2019s heart so that I can see for myself that there\u2019s no crack down the centre because of me. \n\nStill slightly drunk, we argue. Even now in the late afternoon my recollection of the morning is hazy. I\u2019ve long suffered with checking behaviours related to OCD and although therapy has helped to curb them, enduring blackouts as often as I do wreaks havoc on my mental health. I fill in all the black spots in my memory with wild, overly\\-imaginative, sometimes laughable, often terrifying, scenarios. As my boy packed his bags for the trip we found a way to make up and have both vowed to end this once and for all. Although I would instantly take back last night if I could, a part of me is grateful that it happened because if that\u2019s my wake\\-up call then I will consider myself to have gotten off lightly. \n\nAn AA meeting takes place in a few hours right around the corner and I am mustering up the courage to attend. I\u2019m scared and I might not go today but that\u2019s okay because I can and will go when I am ready. With my boy away I plan on going to my mums for a couple of nights and taking solace in the comfort of home and when he gets back on Monday we can start our sober life together.\n\nThank you for reading this and IWNDWYT.

   "selftext": "Please can I just have some advise or hear what other people out there think?  \n\nI never drank until I was 21 and was not into partying in college. When I started drinking more with my boyfriend (now husband), alcohol became something exciting and new and feeling drunk or buzzed was fun. Eventually, if I drank, I would want to do it for the purpose of feeling the alcohol even if it was only three and it was usually when we were with other people who were also drinking or if my husband and I were at home having some beers. \n\nMy husband started telling me that I had a problem and for many reasons (he can be very controlling in many aspects of our life and it is stressful), I got tired of feeling like he was always monitoring (picking up my can to see how full it was, giving me looks if I drank too fast, asking how many I had, etc.) how much I drank and so I started to be secretive; like taking a beer from the back of the fridge or not letting him see that I was in my third beer instead of my first. Sometimes I even thought it was exciting to sectretly drink and I would buy two or four drinks at the store and drink them before I got out of the car at home. \n\nWhen I became pregnant, It was easy to not drink at all, but when I came home from the hospital, my mom had bought me a bottle of champagne to celebrate. I knew my husband would disapprove because we were already having issues with him being so controlling of every little thing that had to do with how I took care of the baby. But when my sisters came to visit, they wanted to open the bottle and I just wanted to have a glass to celebrate having a new baby and felt like it was ok since I had plenty of milk pumped to give him a bottle. But my husband got so mad and it made me feel like a trashy parent even though my sisters thought he was overreacting. \n\nThat is just one instance if how I feel that he was overreacting to something that other people have told me is no big deal. Since then, my secretive drinking gradually got worse as I did it more often and I know that that is a problem.\n\nI am just struggling with this whole thing because I don't like when he calls me an alcoholic (maybe I don't like the label) and other people have told me that my behavior (not the secretive drinking but drinking to feel the alcohol) is not alcoholism and they have told me that it is ok to want to drink and to sometimes get drunk. I don't know if I became a secretive drinker because my husband is super controlling or not, but I do know now that it is a problem and I don't want to ruin my family or my marriage. I would rather quit drinking than continue to have these fights with my husband and also to not let my drinking problem get worse which I am choosing to do, but I am frustrated because I feel invalidated that his controlling behavior had anything to do with it. However, I am not trying to find someone to blame for my behavior. \n\nIt will be hard during the moments when I am with family and friends and they are drinking and having fun and I will have to be sober because I just think it is fun. \n\n",

And at the time I was undiagnosed depressive/bi-polar, so sometimes wasn\u2019t the most level headed and it took a toll on our relationship. Anyways I had been saving up for a while and planned to propose to her on our anniversary. Two weeks before this she came over and sat quietly. \nFinally she broke the silence and told me she had been seeing another man. She no longer loved me and hated who I had become. Needless to say this destroyed my world entirely. I became a pit of alcoholism and regular and some not so nice establishments. My downward spiral ended with a failed suicide attempt the left me in the hospital for three weeks. While I was in there, I had someone sneak in a phone so I could reach out to her for some semblance of support( because until this point she was the only person I could speak to about how I was feeling). All I got in response was \u201c take care of yourself, you\u2019ll be fine\u201d. \nFast forward a couple years and now I\u2019ve rebuilt myself. I haven\u2019t had a relationship last more than 4 months because I can\u2019t truly trust anyone the way I did back then. Besides that I\u2019ve become fairly successful in my professional life with my personal taking a back burner approach. ( not much of a choice when you don\u2019t feel like you can connect on a personal level)\nWell today I ran into a friend of mine who is a mutual friend of hers. He happened to mention in passing that she\u2019s getting married in a couple months. \nAll these wounds I thought I\u2019ve closed, things i thought I\u2019ve forgotten, feelings I\u2019ve abandoned, have suddenly came rushing back. I\u2019ve been curled up sobbing in my apartment for hours and I just don\u2019t know what to do. Is this normal? Am I overreacting? Like I haven\u2019t spoken to her in god knows how long and yet this tiny tidbit of information has put me in a state I can\u2019t even begin to describe. \nIf anyone has some advice or encouragement I could use a little right now.\n\nThanks ",

   "selftext": "I've been married to alcoholism for 15 years. I can look back and see those moments where I questioned my own sanity, where I wondered how much longer I could do this, where I thought I'd be stuck for ever. Hindsight is always 20/20. \n\nI left him a year ago. I said no more. We went from a comfortable life to me making it paycheck to paycheck but the kids and I are out...mostly. Stupidly, I thought he loved his children more than the alcohol. I thought he could share custody as long as he was sober when he had them. He's just passed out the whole time they are there. They stay out of his way and fend for themselves. \\(I could definitely use some suggestions from others on the custody track.\\)\n\nI used to get so angry when I was lied to. I've tried to explain to sober him that we know. We know your signs. Your rigid body becomes noodles. You articulate with your hands, gesturing everywhere. Your slur begins almost immediately and your tone becomes much more aggressive and mean spirited. You text passive aggressive nasty things to me. You forget to text your kids goodnight. You sleep for hours during the day. But I'm the one crazy. I'm the one making things up. \n\nHe handed me a 30 day chip last week...except he was drunk 2 nights the previous week, and the week before.\n\nI get so angry, sad, feel the injustices. My children and I go to therapy. I read this forum. And this past week I read things that made me say enough. I will not let this consume me. I will not let this consume my children. I will not let this disease take anymore energy than it already has. We are seeking out meetings next week. Al\\-anon and Alateen. Does anyone know, should I be there during the kids' meeting, can I go to a meeting at the same time? \n\nThank you all for your courage and your stories. ",

   "selftext": "So here\u2019s the deal:\nI\u2019ve been working in the craft beer industry for about 5 years now, started as an intern, quickly got moved up to brewer, then management. After three years at that company, I moved out of state for a girl I was getting serious with. Climbed up at my new company from assistant brewer, to head, then regional brewer for all our pubs in the state all within a year. I\u2019m good at it, apparently even as a functioning alcoholic. Girlfriend left (not entirely because of my drinking, but it absolutely did not help). I\u2019m becoming less and less functional now, and am at the point where I\u2019m hiding my drinking, coming in hungover all the time, forgetting about tours and festivals I\u2019ve scheduled, and I think the quality of my product is suffering for it. I\u2019ve come to the decision after a rough night of the shakes and some mild hallucinations last night that I need to change career paths entirely. That is completely terrifying. I\u2019ve moved twice in the last year, and don\u2019t have a lot saved as a result. If I quit I lose my insurance, and brewing is my primary skill set. I worked in live audio/event management for a few years before I started brewing professionally, and have a BA in communications. Job market isn\u2019t great in that field, either. Anyone have any similar experiences? I\u2019m at a loss. The job I used to love is killing me. \n\nTl;dr became an alcoholic while working in the beer industry, only know how to do beer stuff. Where can I possibly go from here? Thanks for reading. ",

Beautiful to hear the birds sing and join with others in my community to reduce the stigma behind mental illness. I walked with my boyfriend and sister, two people who saw me in the depths of my alcoholism and depression. \n\nI'm so grateful to be alive today. I have my ups and downs, but I feel so much better in myself. I'm more confident, happy and present.\n\nFor all of those who are struggling, I was full of stop starts in my sobriety journey. We're all warriors, as long as we keep coming back, that's the main thing.\n\nI raise my coffee to all you sober warriors today.

   "selftext": "Good morning, my favorite group of people. \nMy alcoholism started when I started graduate school. I had to fly 2x a month to school (several states away) for my program... the rest was online. I was terrified of flying, so I started getting drunk on the planes. Like, really drunk. It eventually turned into me getting drunk before doing homework, me getting drunk after class, and then me getting drunk all of the time- funny how that happens, eh?\nAt the last semester (last August) I decided to begin my sobriety journey. I opened up to some close class mates about needing support. One of them replied, \"I don't understand why they say that relapse is a part of recovery... doesn't that encourage relapse?\". I thought about this for a while. I eventually replied with something along the lines of that fact that I believe that so long as we learn from our mistakes and reflect on our relapses, it makes us stronger and more in communication with our sober self. I tried explaining the disease, the change in dopamine, the neuropathways, etc... and she replied, \"OH! It's kind of like my food addiction!\". She actually started reading This Naked Mind with me, and worked on her food addiction. She then understood the \"relapse\" and how it can be a tool in recovery, as long as she was learning from it.\n\nI've read This Naked Mind twice. I check in here 4-5x/week. I've been to a few AA meetings. I've opened up to my family. And I still relapse. I used to become extremely discouraged about my relapses. But, it has taught me to learn more. Study more. Reflect more. Teach others about this nasty, shitty disease to reduce the stigma. Just like school- if I had a bad grade on a paper, I needed to study more. Focus more. Take it more seriously. Just like sobriety. \n\nAnd just like I don't expect to become the perfect professional once I graduate (in JULY!!), I don't expect to be perfect about my drinking. I need to be agile, learn from my mistakes, be open to further tools and education, and set the bar high for myself. Life-long learning has become my goal, and I hope someday I can pay it forward and teach all that I have gained from my degree in sobriety. \n\nIWNDWYT!",

   "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI've been gradually tapering up to 50mg naltrexone daily.\n\nMy alcohol consumption has definitely decreased, but I am SOOOO bored in my downtime. I think this is why I started drinking in the first place... I don't really have any friends and only occasionally see my family.\n\nI'm guessing this means I need to find some kind of hobby?\n\nAnyone have any experience to share? I'm slowly realizing that drinking is more and more pointless and doesn't actually make me feel good. Just need to find something to do in place of drinking... The problem is I don't really have money to do anything else. :/\n\nI have tried playing free video games but they get pretty boring after awhile too... I usually watch Netflix all day but that on its own isn't enough to keep me occupied. I've gained so much weight from drinking \\(and spent so much money\\) that is why I am trying to quit now. It all started off as helping me fall asleep and then I fell into a habit of drinking 24 beers in a night or 750 ml of vodka in a night. If I am off work for the day I start drinking as soon as I wake up ... if I am driving 2 hours to see my family I get cinnamon whiskey and take a couple pulls during my drive ... nobody has said anything about noticing alcohol on my breath. But I know it's a problem and I am committed to quitting. It's just so hard. That's why I asked my doctor for naltrexone \\(which was pretty high copay but I figure cheaper than drinking long\\-term\\). ",

That's what people have said to me for a few years now, well when I'm honest more than a few years, more like 10 years, so fuck 'em why not prove them right, that'll teach them!  A year or so ago my wife was crying in bed saying she married a drunk after she got home around 7ish and I was drunk juggling knives and cooking a five course meal making a mess out of the kitchen she had just cleaned.  After that night I quit drinking for 23 days until we were having sushi and I kept saying how I wanted a beer but thought I could moderate, even though secretly I knew it would lead back to me sneaking shots when the wife went to the bathroom or hiding beer cans before she got home and brushing my teeth.  I could feel my liver the next day hurting from the amount I was drinking consistently.  My grandfather on my mother's side was a drinker, same with my dad though in much more moderation around the kids, we never saw him drunk though, my brother and his wife had been clean for 5 years or so now.  Alcoholism is in my blood, I accept this.  However, I accept that it's in my control whether or not to drink.  I know I want to not die from liver poising before my baby daughter graduates from college.  I told my wife today when I got home I'm done, permanently, forever.  I know my life will be better without alcohol.\n\nIWNDWYT",

   "selftext": "So I'm a (former) blackout drinker. As many on this sub I only drank to get drunk and I loved drinking alone since it would mean I don't have to carry on conversations. I would just watch YouTube and get wasted.\n\nI started drinking only when I went to study to a different country. I was so happy I escaped the control of my relatively strict parents, I just went wild for a while. Then my drinking got more casual (or so I thought). In reality I always went overboard at least once a month, cause I \"had to\" numb myself and forget about reality. Preferably without my best friend/roommate knowing about it since she hated seeing me drunk.\n\nThen fast forward a couple years I changed career and found a stable job along with a new group of heavy drinking friends who were a bit older than me. And I kinda looked up to them, I thought that they were cool adults and I really wanted to fit in. On the first night I met them, I drank a lot of shots with them and eventually threw up and fell asleep in the bathroom. They called me an uber, the driver had to stop multiple times for me to vomit on the road. I was super embarrassed the next day but they told me it happens, no big deal.\n\nEvery time after that when I was hanging out with them, I tried to control myself but I wasn't satisfied with just being tipsy. At some point I started buying booze on the way home and getting \"properly\" hammered on my own. Or just going to the office on the weekend and drinking beer all day long there (we don't have cameras or security).\n\nFast forward a couple months, we have a team building event at work at a pension out of town. Booze is free, so I drink everything I can get my hands on, then dance and blackout. In the morning I'm not hungover but can't step on the left foot. Turns out I fell while dancing and badly sprained my ankle, my colleagues had to carry me to the room. Super embarrassing. After that they drove me home and I stayed in bed for a week. Guess what, it's been 6 months and it still hurts and I still limp around. Injury #1.\n\nThen my heavy drinking friends invited me for an outdoor pagan holiday which basically means getting drunk all day guilty free. I was excited, bought some good vodka which we drank at like 11 am along with beer and mimosas. Then the whole day got blurry, at some point I was offered a sip of hard liquor and drank the whole bottle instead. At night we went to a restaurant where I blacked out and fell sleep on the table a few times but refused to stop drinking. After that my good friend didn't talk to me for a week and my roommate (same one) got really worried so I promised both of them that I won't drink hard stuff and never make fool of myself again. \n\nOf course I broke the promise that same month. But I was behaving well (meaning not causing any big trouble), so it was \"fine\". Also somewhere along the way I built my tolerance and stopped vomiting after shots.\n\nNow comes the last event. Two weeks ago we went to a one of my friends' country house to party hard. I drank a lot of vodka on the first day and on the second we only had beer so I was kinda bummed and went to bed early. Then comes the last night and I buy vodka as a gift for a friend at home but decide to share it with everyone. Then I'm offered acid and of course I take it. They buy more beer, I buy more vodka. We get to cottage, I start drinking and talking about linguistics and black out. \n\nI woke up without hangover and found a dirty bucket near my bed. I was wearing my friend's shirt. No one really filled me in, pretending nothing happened. We went back home and I felt pain near my heart, I couldn't take a deep breath or move without pain. I got scared and started google search on signs of alcoholism and found this sub. After a few days my friend told me, that I was having a bad trip that night and went to the woods on my own in the middle of the night. My friends found me and dragged me to the cottage and put me to bed. I started vomiting in my sleep, they had to sit near me whole night cause I couldn't stop vomiting. I have zero memory of it.\n\nMy chest still hurts and I have a big bruise on my back. That's injury #2. After that trip I decided to stop drinking. I have yet to tell those friends about it, but I'm determined to get sober.\n\nAlso last night I watched Eurovision with a different group of people, they had some wine and cocktails, I was drinking water with lime and mint. A girl was sitting next to me, she was already drunk but kept drinking, talking and saying sorry for everything she said. I recognized myself in that girl. I would get hammered last night if it wasn't for this sub. \n\nThank you everyone and I won't drink with you today.",

Growing up, I've seen firsthand the emotionally affects of alcohol on myself and my siblings. I didn't begin drinking until 21, but once I started, it quickly became a daily thing. I decided to stop, because I finally realized my drinking was not helping me, it was hurting me. I drank every day, 3\\-5 drinks a night. I sat at home alone, drinking. I could never stop at 1, and often drank half a bottle of wine, if not the entire bottle. By the weekend, I'd binge and wake up with killer hangovers that took 2 days to resolve. My brief days off were when I ran out of booze, and didn't feel like buying more. I'm a pedestrian, so I relied on Instacart and Drizly.\n\nI'm 32, and I'm also Bipolar \\(in remission\\). I've been diligently taking my lithium, however alcohol depressed my mood, and it would take me half a day to recover from the night's abuse. My lithium usage meant I no longer got the euphoric high from booze, I just got tired. However, I still kept going, and wasn't honest to my psychiatrist. I've called in hungover to my job several times. \n\nI finally decided to stop after seeing a Tasty article about cutting back. I downloaded a sobriety app and joined this community after a week, and my app no longer counted hours until next milestone. I decided I needed the extra support. \n\nStopping is the best thing. I now realize my alcohol use was fucking with my lithium. I am now clear\\-headed and energetic. I had some fatigue yesterday, but today I slept in and feel ready to seize the day. I attended a concert at a bar two days ago, and did not drink and was not tempted. It was the best I've ever been to. ",

I felt like I couldn\u2019t have fun without being somewhat drunk. I felt like I had truly hit rock bottom when I woke up in a random\u2019s house with less friends than I had the day before due to some poor actions. \n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. Another teenager being melodramatic about her teenage problems, all that bullshit. But when you\u2019re my age you feel like the whole world is looking down on you, waiting for you to become something you\u2019re not. I got lonely and scared so I drank. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until New Year\u2019s Eve that I realised that I had an actual problem. It\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve, at a house party feeling like I\u2019m living my best life. Everyone\u2019s drunk including me, we\u2019re having a fun time and then in the next moment I wake up on the front lawn a few hours later. \n\nMy friends decide it\u2019s time for us to probably go home, so we all go back to my aunts free house. After a few hours, I\u2019m still drunk but now everyone\u2019s fallen asleep except me because I feel strange. \n\nI vomit in the sink, the acid burning my throat making me cry and then the pain kicked in. Never in my life had a felt a more excruciating pain than this. The muscles in my legs and my hands felt like something was crushing it, like someone was grabbing my muscles and gripping it so hard and tight. No matter what I did that pain was still there. I started crying again. Eventually I found that I couldn\u2019t breathe, I was literally gasping for air, my body shaking. The pain wouldn\u2019t go away and I was on the verge of a panic attack. Not to be melodramatic again but I was so scared of what was happening to me. \n\nIt continued on for what felt like hours the excruciating pain never stopping. I don\u2019t remember what happened after that but I woke up lying on the floor with a blanket over me. Later I found out one of my friends had come over because he heard me cry out. He tried to calm me down but it didn\u2019t work and I told him to go away. He left but then later came back to find me passed out so he put a blanket over me. \n\nI still have no idea what happened to me but ever since then I\u2019ve tried to stop drinking because I\u2019m scared it was because of the alcohol and it will happen again. I find myself reaching for a drink but I remind myself of the unbearable pain that came with it. I want to say that I stopped drinking because I wanted to and knew I needed to but it\u2019s because I\u2019m just scared. \n\nEdit: I also forgot to mention that my parents have no idea that I drink. My whole family is quite religious and would most likely kick me out if they found out half the things I have done. Don\u2019t get me wrong I love them more than anything and they love me but I feel like I can\u2019t talk to them about it.  ",

This is probably where a lot of us start.\n\nAt the time I was still in a long term relationship \\(toxic but I couldn't see it\\), had a good career, nice condo and two dogs. Alcohol had me on my hands and knees \\(literally\\) and I was slowly dying but other than that my life didn't look that bad from the outside. In treatment I met people far worse off from homeless to court ordered and when I heard their stories I felt guilty for being there because I wasn't \"that bad\".....YET\n\nI haven't been arrested, yet. I haven't been forcibly committed to psych wards and hospitals,  yet. I've never faced real health or life consequences from my drinking, yet. I haven't been truly depressed and suicidal, yet.\n\nSince then I have done all of the above and more. 6 rehabs and 3 sober living houses, seizure from withdrawal, more ambulance bills and hospital stays than I can count. Broken hand punching a cop during one of my many arrests. Alcohol cirrhosis and broken ribs. Lost my relationship, dogs, drivers license \\(from seizure\\),  career and damn near my mind, my family and my life. \n\nI now sit here exactly like the recovered alcoholics had told me back then about how bad things will get if you are alcoholic and do not seek help. I spent this passed Christmas in jail arrested for public intoxication and then rearrested while in jail for assault on another \"inmate\". I posted bail walked into a wine store at 10:02am and walked out with 2 bottles. I had no ID or cell phone or money nor did I care at all about the future. I drank the two bottles in the taxi home planning to book a trip to Mexico and end it all in a blur of hookers n blow. If it wasn't for my friend and whoever put him in my life to drop everything and drive down to me I wouldn't be typing this right now.\n\nThat spree went a couple more weeks until my friend manged to get my formed for 72 hours and it was exactly what I needed. He had taken me to the hospital prior but I would pull my own IV's out and leave. I spent those 72 hours really deciding whether I wanted to die or give recovery an honest go.\n\nMy friend picked me up from the psychward on the condition that I attend 1 meeting a day \\(he had spent those 72 hours speaking to doctors, counselors and AA\\) and took me from the hospital straight to a meeting. I've gone from hating AA to looking forward to it. I let my ego go and asked for help.\n\nMy life has gotten better 10 fold since I made that decision. It has NOT been easy \\- I was close to 3 months and slipped \\- I'm currently 43 days sober but in a far better mindset than ever in my recovery. When I slipped instead of self hate and pitty pot snowballing into a full out run, I went back to AA the next day and tried to figure out why it happened. Relapse is a part of recovery \\(but it doesnt have to be!\\). If you fall learn and get back up.\n\nThis has been a long rant and my first post here. I've been a long\\-time lurker but I haven't been to a meeting in a few days and figured this would help \\(it has\\).\n\nMake your sobriety your number one priority and realize NOTHING gets better picking up. Anything alcohol hasn't already taken from you is just on loan from the bottle its waiting to collect.\n\nMeditate, get out of your own head and enjoy the gift sobriety offers. This too shall pass and it WILL get better.\n\nThanks for the read ",

The cause was [esophageal varices](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esophageal-varices/symptoms-causes/syc-20351538).\n\nI assumed he hasn't been drinking the past two years, though seemed to be addicted to valium. When I went home for Easter (I live about 4 hours away), I had suspicions he was tipsy/drunk which I haven't felt before for awhile. He was always high functioning: just a bit more relaxed, but never blacking out nor incoherent. As I assume the rest of you are, I've always been hypersensitive to these things since a child. I snooped around but couldn't find anything.\n\nBut after being sent to hospital, my step mum found multiple white wine bottles, full and empty, hidden away in one of the spare rooms. My dad's returning home tonight, and my step mum spoke with him. He first made a joke about it (\"oh, you caught me!\"), but then promised to not drink again.\n\nAt this stage, I'm hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. As I've gotten older and gone through my own reflections, a lot of what I've learned reflects the /r/AIAnon ethos. Ultimately, it's not up to me to help him nor feel compelled to control and monitor his drinking if he won't help himself. My anger is justified, but alcoholism is a disease. And, ultimately, I love him unconditionally and he has done the best he can. I am also reminded of such things as the illusion of free will and the illusion of the self.\n\nAll I can do is tell him I love him, treat him like an adult, and express how I feel. I'll also let him know I won't ask about alcohol, snoop around, nor direct my pain towards him if he has been drinking. But, if I am visiting the family home and I suspect he has been drinking, I won't be staying. I'll head back to my family home or stay with friends. I'm not sure if that's helpful? But it seems like appropriate boundary setting.\n\nFeeling a lot of things right now, but it's good to accept it's not my fault.",

   "selftext": "From my early 20's \\(I'm now early 30's\\) I always had low self\\-esteem, but I was still extroverted and had plenty of friends and girlfriends. Deep down I felt that I had to be 'great' for anyone to care about me. So I spent years working on myself \\(almost a decade\\). I grew a career into being a six figure earner \\(2\\-300k\\) a year which is big for where I live especially. I became better looking to the point where many women openly tell me how attractive I am. I embraced talents, learned instruments, became knowledgeable, extroverted, socially\\-savvy and worldly.\n\nDespite all of that, nobody cares about me still. Most of the women I dated just tried to use me, treated me like absolute dog\\-shit on a human decency scale or constantly tried to manipulate me into shit situations. I still feel miserable inside and insanely alone. I've gotten to the point where I drink to an unhealthy level and smoke to an unhealthy level \\(Although I am completely functional still and not a 'angry or crazy' drinker.\\)\n\nI did everything I was supposed to do, and became better than I ever could of imagined, yet nobody genuinely gives a shit about me either way. In fact, I'd say now people treat me even worse than before because they feel permitted to do so because I'm so 'well\\-off.' I'm starting to understand why there is a big correlation between successful people and alcoholism. It's not because successful people are all dopamine fiends, it's because you realize that when you're successful the people around you legit don't give a shit about you on a human level.\n\nI genuinely don't have any motivation to keep doing things. I know no matter what I accomplish i'll be fucking miserable and alone. 10\\+ years has proven that to me. So for people who read this, and think self\\-improvement alone will help you, it won't. It might just make things worse, in my case it did, I just get to cry into a 800\\-thread count pillow case instead of a 200\\-thread count pillow case. Same bullshit, just stings a bit more when you realize your work and efforts were basically for nothing. ",

I can go a week or two without drinking fine, but I notice I just go to the extremes.\n\nI have lost 3 iPhone's so far in 2018, I also lost an iPhone in August 2017 which lead to an argument with my (then) girlfriend and her complaining that I'm not responsible enough and I get too drunk (all true). I lost another phone before I met my ex in early 2017. So I'm up to 5 phones in 12 months. If we go further back I'd say I lose a phone or 2 every year and nearly always while drunk.\n\nThis past weekend I got blindly drunk, uber'd home from a boat party I snuck into at 2am (I had not been home all weekend) woke up Monday and couldn't find my phone, I'd lost this same phone 7 days earlier - used find my iPhone and had to collect it from some African dude who found it on a train platform.\n\nI used find my iPhone at 2:30pm the next day and it showed it was like 20 metres from my house in the middle of a car park next to some houses on 1% batt - a full 12 hours since I got my uber home so I'm doubting the gps was accurate and that it's just in my house somewhere. I've been looking all week. I can't keep losing phones and buying new ones.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI spoke to my therapist last Thursday and explained how I felt. He said it's no surprise I'm choosing to go out and see people and drink, the alternative is being at home, alone, feeling guilt that I couldn't save my mum dying from cancer. I literally watched her die, the strongest most powerful person in my life, my rock and my comfort, reduced to skin and bones, unable to eat or talk. A skeleton, it still haunts me. I'm not close with my family, my grandma's second husband abused my mother, which ultimately killed her as she didn't go to smear tests as it was too invasive for her, but this allowed abnormal cells to grow in her cervix which developed into cervical cancer. By the time they found it, they predict she must have had it for 10 years. I thought I could have researched some natural remedies, alternative ways to beat cancer for her, instead I hid, I let the doctors and my family deal with her. But my therapist has helped me realise I'm not to blame and I couldn't do anything to save her.\n\nI drink and go out because the alternative is pain, and my therapist says it's a survival mechanism. Be charming, be fun, be around people.\n\nI'm at work and quite drunk, I went on a date last night and as I've not had a phone for a week, I bought an iphone 6s for \u00a350 from the sister of the girl I've always loved since school (will update that thread later). I didn't set an alarm and woke up at 10am today (I start work at 8:30am). I banged a girl who is the little sister of a girl that was in my class in school, this girl is now 25 and gorgeous. Anyway. I feel quite ****ed up and I defo have a drinking problem.\n\n",

And he is changing his tack, according to him last Friday during our last session. He says he is going to \"be pushing me\", and that we \"need to put our foot on the gas\" during our last two months of the year long program I am in. I was in a bit of a depressive state until he pulled me out of it after about a half an hour into our last session. \n\nBut he told me that it is hard, that it is difficult for him to deal with my depressive states. Now if we are friends, as he has repeatedly said we are, that makes sense to tell me.

Something about it rubbed me wrong. This is, or was, a collaborative, client driven process. I would like to have been asked about my feelings as to my ability, and my comfort level being pushed. And whether I wanted to put the foot on the gas. Because I do not. I am making progress continuously, and I am pretty happy with my rate of recovery. If we went a little faster I would be fine.

But longer term it will make me angry and resistant as all hell. But I want to work with him, not frustrate him. So I am not sure. This is a bit of a vent, he is here in two hours, but it is a larger issue of him becoming somewhat insistent, scolding and blamey when I do not accomplish something he wants me to, nice though he is.

   "selftext": "Hello. I have been working with the addiction counselors, worker, and therapist for 6-10 months now for childhood trauma, autism, and alcoholism. Me and my worker have worked very well together, he has been incredibly helpful. This morning I cleaned this whole place, started laundry, ate something, and put dinner into the crock pot, not a meaningless thing for me. But I am supposed to do the school work towards the last two credits of highschool. Oh, I will do it. But there is four months until it needs to be in in mid September in time for graduation on October. And I just cannot get the motivation. It will get done, but it is awful, I am thirty seven, and it is as awful as when I was in school the first time. Just enough work to be vaguely difficult, teaches nothing I did not already know though, and does not get into enough depth to either be interesting or actually teach something meaningful.\n\nBut my social worker is coming in a couple hours. And he is changing his tack, according to him last Friday during our last session. He says he is going to \"be pushing me\", and that we \"need to put our foot on the gas\" during our last two months of the year long program I am in. I was in a bit of a depressive state until he pulled me out of it after about a half an hour into our last session.\n\nBut he told me that it is hard, that it is difficult for him to deal with my depressive states. Now if we are friends, as he has repeatedly said we are, that makes sense to tell me. But I still question if we are, he does not visit socially, a big part of friendship in my view, kinda the core of it. But if he is not my friend, he was just being nice, then how is that helpful for me to hear?. Oh, it only makes sense he feels it.

   "selftext": "**TL;DR BELOW**\n\nI feel like shit. Empty and numb - yet anxious. Sick. \n\nWhere to start...? \nHey. I'm a loser guy in my late-twenties.\n\n*[First, I'd like to note that this is not an emergency, and I'm not in danger.]*\n\nI'm currently dealing with a recent breakup, obvious depression, anxiety, mild to moderate drug withdrawal issues... Oh, and I missed work today.\n\nJust couldn't go in. The commute is long (2 hours - minimum) and stressful (high, often chaotic traffic - with rainy weather today to boot).\n\nAs for the withdrawals, I'm doing everything I can to keep myself at ease, and gently taper off from my drug use. I'll have to force myself to eat again, soon. Right now, I'm resting. Just focused on relaxing and keeping myself calm and distracted. \n\nI term this my \"Survival Mode.\"\n\nMy vitals are fine. The main issue seems psychological instead of physical.\n\nI've been using drugs for multiple weeks (uppers, downers, and a dissociative) to deal with work, life, depression, recovery from alcohol abuse, and to NOT deal with feelings from the breakup (online long-distance; close to 3 years).\n\nI binged a lot over the weekend to de-stress and avoid the negative impact from the end of my long-term relationship.\n\n*[I never drove while under the influence of anything but low-dose stimulants and did not do heavy drugs at work.]*\n\nShe lived in another country and had three kids as a single mom. Realistically, It was never going to work, but I felt she understood me... Frankly, I think she was already growing distant from me, anyway. \n\nI've struggled with depression for over a decade, and I struggled with alcoholism/binge drinking for around four years.\n\nWhen I heard a certain dissociative drug could help with major depression, anxiety and addiction (when dosed under proper - expensive - medical supervision), I did a lot of research and obtained different dissociative drug myself. \n\n*[Obviously, this is not recommended! DON'T do what I did - I'm not endorsing any unprescribed drug use!]*\n\nThe dissociative I found online a little over a month ago helped me to stop drinking and craving alcohol. This is in addition to other supplements/drugs as well.\n\nTripping helped my life immensely. I was desperate! Work, life and financial anxieties were overwhelming me. I tried to be safe and I did extensive research, yet ultimately, I was often reckless due to said desperation.\n\nThis useful tripping on that dissociative came at the price of a close-call (family almost called 911 to get me to the emergency room), and it would eventually lead to my girlfriend breaking up with me. Multiple factors were involved pertaining to the breakup- not just the drug use. \n\nSo here I am now.\n\nI apologize for the long post and rambling. My situation is a complicated, hellacious, FUBAR mess.\n\nThere's still a lot I left out. \n\n**TL;TD**\n\nDoes anyone else go into a sort of \"Survival Mode\" when their depression and anxiety get really bad - where all you can do is shower, try to eat, and keep yourself sane and distracted? \n\n...Fuck. That is all. Please take care of yourselves! Hang in there, folks.",

   "selftext": "Just posting in need of support/advice. My mother has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember. I never really realized she was an alcoholic though until I got older (19 now), I always just thought she had anger issues or maybe she was bipolar which is why her moods go up and down (I never blamed it on the alcohol. My mom hasn\u2019t had a job in a few years and when she did have one she was always at work drunk (she was a waitress) she ended up quitting her job when her coworker (who is the owners wife) died of alcohol poisoning. Anyways, that was a lot of precursor... but, now after many failed attempts my mom is trying to detox from alcohol on her own. She started on Thursday and everything got worse from there. She was vomiting constantly but then stopped after three days because she no longer has anything in her system. Yesterday she slept the entire day and when she was awake she was extremely confused. Today was even worse, I woke up to her running around the back yard thinking there were animals chasing her. She came back in the house and couldn\u2019t stop mumbling and saying that random animals or people were in the house. Eventually, she agreed to go to the emergency room.. which was at the exact right time. As soon as she got into the ER she started speaking in what definently didn\u2019t sound like English just very confused and not making any sense. She was very hostile and angry. She was then moved to the ICU and is currently still being treated there. At this point in the state she is in it seems like she is brain dead or has severe brain damage but maybe it is just the withdrawal. I guess I\u2019m just looking for some advice or past experiences. Most importantly someone to tell me that it\u2019s going to be okay.",

I\u2019m in my early twenties, graduating from college on Friday. I\u2019d like to say that the emotion that I\u2019m feeling is excitement, but I\u2019m terrified. College has been tough for me. The majority of people would say that college was the time of their lives , but for someone who struggles with some pretty intense social anxiety and depression it can be torture. So many happy smiling peers hanging out with friends, hitting the bars, having fun, while I sit at home alone in my single bedroom apartment drinking until I pass out. Recently I\u2019ve been on a long stretch of drunken nights and mornings where I swear that I\u2019m not drinking that day, only to break down around that terrible 4/5/6 pm line. I can feel the switch begin to flip around 2 or 3. By 4 my resolve is slipping, by 5 I\u2019m on the way to the liquor store, by 6 I\u2019m on my way to brown out city. \n\nBut today is different. It\u2019s nothing spectacular, I haven\u2019t been particularly productive or formed some new stronger resolution. I just don\u2019t feel like drinking tonight. It\u2019s strange thing that just seems to happen from time to time. I\u2019ve been struggling with finding the courage to go to an AA meeting for a long time. I just have a hard time dragging myself to one because... I don\u2019t even know. I suppose I\u2019m afraid of changing. I\u2019m miserable at my current state in life, but it\u2019s predictable I guess, safe. It\u2019s funny because by now I\u2019ve read and listened to enough material on alcoholism how positively life changing sobriety is, I just can\u2019t make the leap. But I think that I\u2019m rounding mental corner, and soon I\u2019m going to be ready. I don\u2019t know if what I was hoping to get out of this post, but I\u2019ve been reading others and I just felt like putting this out there, why not?

   "selftext": "I have always had \"problems\" internally, regardless of how I seemed to others. Social anxiety for example. Most social interaction felt strained, awkward, or uncomfortable. Afterwards, I might ask someone else who was there, \"did I act normal?\". The response was usually \"yeah, of course, why did it not seem that way to you?\" I suppose I was just really good at hiding it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFunny, most of these problems were ones I didn't even know I had. That is, until I met someone that helped achieve some buoyancy and get my head above the water for long enough to recognize my plight: I was very anxious.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat was 8 years ago, and since that point I have learned more and more about what makes me tick, and why I am the way I am.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe first realization was that I was transgender. For the next few years I spent most of my time doing some internal questioning about what that meant for me and what the next steps would be. I even attempted transition, but found that it provided no benefit to me in practical life. Up until about a year ago, I thought this thing I knew about myself was the end-all-be-all. It explained everything I experienced, why social interactions were hard for me, and seemingly every other issue I could recall from my past. Or so I thought.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen you begin to dig really deep into gender and who you are compared to others, you may find that you aren't so different...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nStill, I knew what I needed to do, and that was transition, and transition I did. Soon enough, however, it became clear that my life was no better than it was before, just different. I had traded one set of obstacles for another without any net gain. So I gave it up, and went back to being myself.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat was about 6 months ago. Still, the question remained: if so many people out there are able to achieve a modicum of peace and success in their lives despite hurdles like that, why can't I?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI began looking at my upbringing. I found that from my perspective, my family seemed loving and relatively happy. I was the son of a single mother of two, who was the daughter of a successful stock broker and home-making wife, whom had 4 healthy kids, all who had kids themselves. We spent Christmases and Thanksgivings together as a family, with smiles and laughs and all the things you could hope for growing up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI had a father who tried to be a Dad, at least when I was younger, but had a lot of mental issues including addiction, alcoholism, and general assholery. Eventually our relationship went from distant to non-existent. I didn't know his family.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI loved my family, or at least thought I did...I'm not as sure now (since love itself is in question). Like I said, I have little outside perspective, so it's hard for me to see what issues there might be. And as a disclaimer: I'm thankful for what I've had. I really couldn't have asked for a better childhood, I had a lot of really care-free times as a kid. But since I have failed in all aspects of life, from relationships to work over and over, I have to ask questions.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCouple things to point out: almost every member of the family has dealt with anxiety or depression, or is dealing with them now. When we meet, it's almost an assumed thing that one of us is dealing with it at any given time, since it's hard to hide when you know someone. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSecond thing: Appearances have always been of utmost priority to my family. The general rule is: If you're not happy, look happy, or try to hide your sadness as best as you can. If you're angry, don't be direct, that might hurt someone's feelings or cause an issue, and we don't want issues.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've spent time with other families, and they might give each other shit, maybe even argue or fight from time to time. That NEVER happened in my family save for a couple of occasions. That brings me to the relationship with my Mom: We never fought. Ever. Disagreements were mild, with my mom usually relenting to my view on things to save from having hard conversations. Didn't do my chores? An exhasperated laugh followed by\"I really wish you would've done them.\" And then I'd feel guilty enough to do them. A couple years ago I started to realize that I felt like if I truly were to go against her wishes, she would abandon me. Whether that would happen or not, I don't know, but it was this deep, existential feeling that I could never overcome, and is still there. Like I'm on the verge of being abandoned by the only person that cares.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe also seems to be completely unable to offer any emotional support, though not for lack of trying. She will listen to me explain how I'm feeling, and try to offer solutions, but somehow I come away feeling worse. I've learned not to talk about feeling bad around her because things only get worse.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe also has some major depression and anxiety, and has never been one for group activities or going out of a pretty reclusive routine, so it makes sense that she would have no strength to give, though strangely has never shared that struggle with me. No one in our family talks openly about it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy sister fares no better, has her own issues, and besides that we don't get along very well and never really have.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter understanding these things, I realized most if not all of my family members function similarly to my mom, and while they might care, don't seem to be able to offer anything beyond an ear for listening. There is no call to action, no tough love, only sympathy. And I only know tough love because of my father, who used it as his ONLY way to show affection, berating or lecturing me anytime we met, which was rarely.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe reason I bring this up is because lately, I've been feeling very alone. I feel like no one cares, TRULY cares. Not enough to call me on my shit, not enough to do more than say, \"hey, hows it goin?\" and then small talk me to death.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI know all this makes me seem like a cry baby, like waaah-you had fun with your family growing up and weren't physically abused or anything, you should feel fine. That's how I see it, and yet, these feelings dominate my life.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is important, because the other thing I learned is that the world is a cut. throat. place. Holy shit. I thought everything was happy go-lucky when I was a kid, but it's a hardcore game of survival out there, and if you don't have support to get you through the hard times, you will either take what you need to survive or die trying.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm starting to rant, but it brings me back to my issue: and that is having a support system. I thought being trans was the problem and solution to my life. Yes, it is a big problem, but it can be managed by having people in your life that care about you.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMore recently:\nOver the last few years I have let friendships go the way of the dodo, all in the understanding that I was going to become this new person: a girl, and we would have to re-get to know each other anyways. Now that that chapter is closed, and those friendships that, in some ways, kept me afloat are mostly vanished.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo here I am, my superman-family is now just a bunch of people wearing capes, I have almost no friends, and I'm suicidal because I don't see a way out. The people around me who care, WANT to care, but don't have the means to do so because they're busy surviving themselves.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe truth is, I would be ok with dying. Like I said, I had a lot of fun growing up, and feel like I've had a good run (despite some issues). But I'm afraid of killing myself or I would've done it by now. I'm honestly surprised I've made it this long.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnyone else out there noticed a lack of a support system? How do you see that affecting you? *If this is something that you don't want to think about, don't let me goad you into doing so, just thought I'd ask for some perspective.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-D\n\n\n",

   "selftext": "I'm not exactly sure why I'm writing this or if it's against the rules but I don't know. Maybe someone will have something interesting to say. Or hopefully it'll scare someone out of letting them self go. Either way here's a story. \n\nAt 23, I've become the complete polar opposite of everything 16 year old me thought I would become. I used to be an athlete, a musician, with a steady job always. I'm none of that now. \n\nIn late 2016 I was forcefully ejected from a musical project I started and put almost 7 years into Just as things were looking up. Shortly after I lost my girlfriend at the time, and with her my apartment and the two pets. \n\nDepression hit me like a brick. I'd never felt anything so enveloping and intense ever before if I'm being honest. So began an intense spiral of drinking all the time, feeling incredibly lost and not knowing what to do. I never sold any of my gear, but I never touch it anymore. I stopped doing martial arts, and therefore gained a whole lot of weight. I used to float around 140, now I'm close to 180. The most common comment I get when I see people I haven't seen in a while is \"wow you've put on weight!\" On top of that I spent so much money on booze and trips and trying to make myself feel better I launched myself into over $7,000 in credit card debt in a year.\n\nI still had a job this whole time, however it made me miserable. I had worked hard to line up a dream job of mine despite the depression (I work in the video industry) and the company hired me. Told me my definite start date was march 2018. So in mid February I quit my shitty unfulfilling job to prepare. March comes, company calls and says there was an \"administration error\" and they have no open position for me. Great. \n\nI had to move back in with my mother, who I am extremely grateful for as a support system. She doesn't have much and still she helps me when I've fallen flat on my face. \n\nThe drinking escalated into alcoholism, so it's extremely difficult to not go and blow money when I have it on my newfound addiction (currently 5 days sober - the longest in over a year and a half). I'm making very little money freelancing, and I cannot find a job for the life of me in this city. Credit card is maxed. Bill is due tomorrow and I have no money. \n\nI know all of this is self inflicted, from a bad reaction to an onset of depression. I guess if I can say any message it would be this: please please don't believe alcohol or drugs will help. Even short term. It's a slippery slope with very little time to get out. \n\nI have no idea what I'm going to do. ",

   "selftext": "Like most of us I started young, drinking in the woods with friends, long before any of it felt dark.  I was just a teenager in the late 90s, hanging with my friends and having some drinks.  It was an adventure, embarked upon by all of us.  A time to test boundaries and flirt with the edges of honesty (and all the cute girls).  It was fun, and mischievous, and exciting.\n\nFast forward a few years and a lot of us, myself especially, were still only focused on that adventure.  On the mischief.  Rebels against the monotony of existence.  Or however I romanticized it.  I had no real direction, but given the time and place and my reasonably good academic performance the path of least resistance carried me into college.  I was a computer science major on paper, but in practice my primary focus was on getting stoned.  I had side hustles to keep money in my pocket and kept up the bare minimum in my classes.  \n\nSomewhere in there, I broke up with the first girl I ever loved after she cheated on me with one of our mutual friends.  High school sweetheart.  There is nothing more utterly doomed and cripplingly dangerous as your first love, and  no more surefire way to have it blow up in your face than trying to maintain that feckless disaster-in-waiting over long-distance.  \n\nA shitty thing to happen to anyone, for sure, but I was already flailing.  Without realizing it until it was too late, I had made that relationship my tether to reality.  My insecurity soared.  My feelings of inadequacy rose to higher heights than ever before.  And I was angry.  Despite all of these tumultuous feelings I was still self-aware not only of how irrational my emotions were, but how I was presenting myself to the world.\n\nThis was a huge turning point in my alcoholism.  That relationship between inner turmoil and outer ease and confidence and impressiveness to others began to blossom.  The weekends were an absolute blur of reckless, aggressive partying, and when I wasn't drinking I was smoking pot.  I was living in a world of pure escapism in retrospect.  I'd started skipping most of my classes, and eventually realized that I'd fail most of them anyways, so I made plans to drop out at the end of the semester.  That final month consisted of nothing but videogames and sleep.  I had fallen into a deep depression.\n\nFast forward a few months living with my disappointed parents, and I managed to get a decent job at a tiny little office as a sort of jack of all trades \"computer guy\".  It paid enough for me to get an apartment with some other \"fringes of society\" type buddies of mine, and my boss was openly fine with me showing up high, so my listless existence of getting stoned and drunk every day continued.  \n\nI eventually quit that job for no good reason (I now understand that I was still in a deep depression). We dumpster dove for food.  I did odd jobs on craigslist for rent.  I dated psychotic weirdo after psychotic weirdo--all drunks, naturally.  \n\nAfter enough of that, I sort of hit a breaking point, and I turned that mechanism back on.  That switch in my brain to separate internal strife from external presentation.  So I lied on my resume and I got a real job, at a real company, making a real salary with insurance and everything.  Eventually I got my own apartment.  And my own liquor cabinet.\n\nI stayed in that job I hated for 8 years.  The IT department was a meat grinder, and I constantly used that employee turnover to claw my way up and up, until I was the most senior guy on the team.  It was an obscenely toxic place to work--it was not unusual to see people openly crying in conference rooms during meetings.  But what did I care?  I wasn't even really there.  \n\nI was a mannequin, and in a sick way I leaned into the negativity and the pain.  I liked it, almost.  I'd endure it, come home, and get absolutely blackout drunk with whatever weird girlfriend I was pretending to be with at the time, then wake up and do it again.  \n\nThere's a through line here, right?  From the moment alcohol entered my life, it became the only relief, the only true and constant companion, the only outlet through which I could experience myself and my life.  Everything else was performance.  I'd spend hours in conversations I did not care about or even remember the next day, purely to find openings for glib witticisms to impress people who I didn't even know.  I became obsessed with cleanliness--clean surfaces, clean car, organized closets.  \n\nRegimented.  Cold.  Calculated.   Until it was time to drink.\n\nEventually I again lied on my resume and applied for two different jobs and got both.  I played them off each other and there I was at 27 years old, a college drop-out alcoholic, making a 6 figure salary.  Socially and professionally I kept being rewarded for this false persona.  For this contrivance of my identity.  So I just kept going.  Kept leaning in.\n\nAnd the drinking got worse, and worse, and worse.  I became incredibly resentful of death.  I would think through gritted teeth about the fact that children would live to see the world as it was long after I was dead, and I vaguely hated them.  I hated a lot of things.  \n\nFast forward again, because this is already entirely too long and worthy of deletion, and I meet the girl who'd eventually become my wife.  We buy a house together.  I help her start a business.  We get a dog.  \n\nSo here I am, a lifetime of doing the bare minimum and lying to everyone about everything all the time to convince the world that I Am A Success, a lifetime of not knowing a morning without a hangover (which were slowly turning into withdrawals), and I'm living the American Dream.  I'm genuinely living a better life than 99% of the people in the world, at least on paper.  I start to wear this as a point of pride.  Like I got something over on the world.\n\nI liked my new job, and my wife was and still is an absolutely beautiful, hilarious person.  The heartbreak and insecurity that had sent me deep into the bottle so long ago was a distant memory now.  \n\nSo why couldn't I stop?  Why were my nights of drinking turning into mornings of drinking?  Why did I suddenly have this water bottle full of Tito's in my work bag under my desk?  Why was I so incredibly and deeply anxious all the time?  Why did my entire day still center around That Next Fucking Drink?\n\n32 days ago, I was 10 days into an absolute bender.  I was drinking a fifth of whiskey or vodka a day, plus 10+ beers of varying strengths.  I wasn't even blacking out because my tolerance had become so astronomical.  We had just sold our house at a huge profit, and were a couple weeks away from closing on a huge, beautiful, brand new construction house one town over.  I was excited, genuinely.  So why the fuck was I losing my grip?  \n\nI was so deep into it that I had started just coming downstairs to sleep on the couch after my wife drifted off, so I could be close to booze for when withdrawals kicked in.  I had no exit plan.  All my previous benders had ended with me and an Excel spreadsheet, neurotically planning a taper and structuring my life around it to minimize the collateral damage.  \n\nNot this time.  This was headed for suicide one drop at a time.  One morning, 32 days ago, my wife found me in the basement, holding an overflowing bottle of some disgusting cask aged banana flavored stout, struggling to get it into my mouth.  She was horrified and confused and exhausted in every sense of the word, and I'll never forget the strange laughter that surrounded her question: \"What the fuck are you doing?\"\n\nFor whatever reason, that hit me hard.  Two hours later I was on a plane to a detox facility.  I blew a .453 when they admitted me.  \n\nI could write another 10,000 words, easily, on the experiences both nightmarish and beautiful that I had there over the next ten days, but I'll spare you that until the next time I'm feeling wordy.  \n\nBut I got the answers to those questions above.  I had always been an atheist, or at least someone who didn't believe humans were anything but highly evolved animals.  And I had always mourned that.  I tried to paint it as freedom--existentialism over nihilism--but at my core I was simply deeply, heavily sad about mortality in general.  So I built a wall around it.  That kept it buried, away from my outward personality, which I crafted specifically to be \"impressive\".  \n\nThe more I worked on that exterior image--those clean, organized living spaces and sharp one-liners--the more that blackness festered.  I was closed off from other people, experiences, and even beauty itself.  I lived a pantomime of a good life, but I was dying inside.  Regardless of external appearances or bank account balances, deep down I was still that lost, confused, depressed 20 year old whose girlfriend chose someone else.  I had hit the pause button in the midst of that pain and I kept it paused for 15 years.  The further I got, the more external pillars I erected to distract from who I really was and prove to everyone that I *am* good enough, the more poisonous that blackness became.  It is no coincidence that at the height of my personal success I reached my lowest and most depraved spiritual point.\n\nI spent such a long time justifying my \"high functioning alcoholism\" with external factors to keep from looking inward, and while I am grateful I didn't go to my grave so \"emotionally unfinished\", wasting those years in that way is my biggest regret in life.  \n\nBut I'm still only 34.  And I didn't lose my great job or my beautiful wife or even that amazing house that drove me to the brink of oblivion.  Today, my goals are not practical ones, they are personal ones, spiritual ones even.  I seek every day to keep my guard down and remain open and vulnerable as much as possible.  Not everyone has to like me, or be impressed by me.  It is far more satisfying and fulfilling for one person to think that I am a compassionate, kind man than for 500 to think I am clever.  And rather than fight so futilely and bitterly *against* death and mortality, I seek to fight *for* beauty.  For the little moments that can utterly break your heart in the most wonderful way if you just stop wallowing in your bullshit for long enough to notice.\n\nAnd coffee.  Drinking lots and lots of coffee.\n\nIf you read this far, I'm sorry there wasn't a great payoff, but it feels really good to get this whole timeline off my chest.\n\ntl;dr - For most of us, drinking is a symptom.  The most important part of getting sober is finding the darkness that spawned it.  Be well.",

I couldn't stand being the person I am with the decisions I've made.\n\nI last posted on here with 9 months sober. Now I'm sitting at just over a year. That one impossible solution, not drinking just for today, has been a mainstay in my life.\n\nThat being said, it's been more of a white-knuckle experience and the pains of not working a program are becoming obvious. I wracked with anxiety, fear, terror, ...more fear. A drink doesn't sound like a good decision right now, but I certainly wish I had a solution to change the way I feel.\n\nI substituted my alcohol addiction with work, the video games, then work, then books, then whatever I could get on my phone. I listened to an AA speaker last night about being joyous. I can relate to not wanting a drink, but I certainly wouldn't describe my disposition as joyous. \n\nA drink won't get me closer to a solution, but not working a program will get me closer to a drink.

But my parents' drinking habits are the worst metrics to use when judging my own. Looking back on this past year, I'm realizing that I was drunk 5 nights a week (being generous). On weekends, I'd get up, distract myself for a few hours, and start drinking with the sun still up. And then other things started becoming clearer.

I felt so much resentment towards them for choosing alcohol over their children, for creating this family that looks so perfect outside the home but toxic and chaotic within. \n\nI guess alcohol is another thing I simply cannot enjoy.

   "selftext": "Hi there, thanks for taking a look at this.\n\nTo make a long story long, my mum started drinking more when my step dad died. He was diagnosed with lung cancer when i was about 14 and then died when i was 17. The day he died my mum woke me up early morning looking quite distraught saying that Alan had fallen and couldn't get back up. This had happened before as the cancer had spread to his brain but this wasn't the case... i shared a bedroom with my stepbrother, and obviously my mum didn't want him to see his dad the way he was. When i came in the room he was on the en suite floor and my mum began attempting CPR whilst pulling blood clots the size of golf balls out of his throat. I phoned the ambulance and tried to stop my step brothers from coming in and seeing what was going on. When the ambulance arrived we left the room but he was announced dead after about 10 minutes of resuscitation.\n\n\nI knew that she'd lost her main companion so I made sure that I spent a bit more time with her on evenings as I didn't want her to be alone. over the course of the next couple of years she started drinking a little more than normal. When I was 19 I went to university and my primary worry was that i was leaving my mum alone.\n\nShe continued to drink on evenings after work but she was always making sure she went to work, did her thing, and then she'd have some drinks on the evening so wasn't to bad. a couple of years later she met a guy called Andy who treats her nice and they're still together now. her drinking had gotten progressively worse but still not shocking, andy doesn't drink at all so he's far from encouraging but he's still there as a partner for her.\n\nAndy's mum has dementia and he's decided to move into her place to take full time care of her, meaning that my mum now lives alone with her partner live miles away. She's very lonely and her drinking has increased ten fold to the point where she doesn't eat much, she no longer works, she's basically cycling from drinking, sleeping on the couch waking up for a bit, drinking, rinse repeat. She's lost a lot of weight and looks like a completely different person. I've talked to her about her drinking only a couple of times but the radical change in the last 2 years is really worrying me and has pushed me to bring it up and talk to her about it. Her house looks like something out of a documentary with empty bottles, cigarettes, rotten food, etc. everywhere. She's self destructing and it's killing me to watch. \n\nThe last time i talked to her about things I sat her down and told her she needs to see a doctor because she's lost control. I talked to her about the massive change in her appearance and that she needs to look after herself because the way she's going she will die within 10 years. She didn't really say much and was in denial quite a lot saying that she just needs to sort herself out. In the end we agreed that we would give it 3 months and if she hadn't regained control she would consider going to the doctor. \n\nI know she hasn't changed at all and is still on the path she was on before that talk. I don't want it to get to the point where it's too late. I understand there are underlying issues and that she has traumas from her past, and loneliness is a massive problem. \n\nAny advice anyone can give would help me so much because I don't know what to do.

   "selftext": "But I have no one in real life to talk to about it (except my therapist) so I feel a little lonely in my sobriety. So I'm here, sharing my small victory with y'all. Thanks for listening!\n\nSome backstory: I'm in my late twenties, have questioned my relationship with alcohol for a long time but kept those doubts to myself. I'd always try to do sober months to 'prove to myself' I didn't have a problem, but I'd never make it longer than 4-5 days at the most. When I was younger I used to be a really bad binge drinker - I've spit on people, hurt myself, had a knife pulled on me by a homeless guy and had to be pulled away from the confrontation by my friends, fucked people I had no intention of fucking -- all in a state of blackout/greyout. Things I would NEVER do sober. \n\nIn the past year or two though it's been less out-and-about bingeing and more consistent solo drinking. I'd get drunk in my room at least a few times a week and hide from my roommates. I was hungover and sleep deprived almost constantly. My anxiety was through the roof. In February, drunk and alone in my room, I made a noose and tried to find a place to hang myself from. Getting frustrated by not finding a sturdy enough spot and too drunk to really put things together, it was like this wave of fear and horror came over me as I realized what I was doing and I cried myself to sleep. After that I really tried to cut back but the pattern only got more toxic. \n\nAt the end of April I had two separate incidents that seemed to tell me I was standing on the edge of a precipice, and if I kept drinking the only way to go was down. Finally, FINALLY, something clicked in my brain. \n\nI haven't touched alcohol since April 29th. I have told my friends (who also drink a lot) that I'm taking a sober month, but I truthfully intend to never drink again. My mother is an alcoholic, and my grandfather hasn't drank since the 90's because of problems with it. So I know it's a genetic thing, and I was probably doomed from the start. But I'm not going to let my genetics dictate my life, and I'm not going to perpetuate my mother's toxicity and alcoholism. \n\nThings are going really well so far. I took a LOT of care to hide my problem from others, so most people I think didn't see me as a problem drinker, except for the few who saw the dark side of me. So that's a blessing and a curse. I hadn't (yet) burned a lot of my bridges, but I also don't have people who understand what a Big Deal this is for me. So I'm telling you all. :) \n\nI've finally got my sleep schedule more or less back on track, my face has lost puffiness and redness, my anxiety and depression has gone way way down and is easier to manage. I've been more productive and happier. I feel almost like I'm a totally different human. I'm not quite sure who that person is, but I'm excited to find out. I'm excited to stop hiding in drunkenness. I got a new haircut with all the money I saved and have been eating well, and exercising, and I feel like sobriety is like this secret superpower that makes me 100% cooler, nicer, stronger, more attractive, and more resilient. \n\nI don't want to get too cocky, because I'm sure there will come a time when I forget all the bad things about the drinking and a voice tells me I can moderate if I just try -- after all, that voice has kept me drinking for the past five years after I stopped enjoying it. But I'll be ready, because I'm not going to give up this chance at leading a rich and full life free from that pain without a hard fight. I know moderation, for me, is a lie. \n\nThe wonderful people over at /r/stopdrinking really helped me get through the first week or so, and I'm still there every day. I haven't gone to AA, but I do have a therapist who I recently told and has been amazing help so far. If you think you might have a problem as well, reaching out for help is so worth it, I promise. \n\nThanks for getting all the way through this novel. ",

I currently drink around 9-10 drinks every other night. My experience has been as follows... drink, then hangover next day which creates an amazing willpower not to drink all the way into the afternoon of the second day and then once nighttime comes around, and I have accomplished a few things I get this overwhelming urge to \u201c have a couple beers in celebration\u201d which then turns into 10. I realize Im not pushing my alcoholic potential  but I\u2019m still worried and. have been doing this for almost a decade and could see myself falling into a cycle that truly affects my health. I was just hoping I could get some tips and tricks to break this cycle before I become really bad. Any advice is welcome and I thank you in advance.",

   "selftext": "Good morning everyone. I need some advice on taking a next step. My boyfriend and I are 24 and have been together for five years. He currently drinks about 2-3 fifths of whiskey a week. Sometimes on the weekends he'll change to gin. He works full-time and is responsible. He pays his bills, has never gotten a DUI, never gotten into a fight, etc. The only problem is that he drinks a lot when he comes home (I am already in bed as I work 8am-5pm and he works 12pm - 11pm). \n\nI have brought it up with him multiple times that I don't like how much he drinks and that I think it's unhealthy. I think he's on the path to alcoholism. His father was in rehab last year for alcoholism and I can see him following that same genetic path.\n\nHowever, I've brought it up so much that it's a sore topic now. He claims I monitor his drinking too much and judge him (on more than just the topic of drinking). I'm not sure what to do at this point. He is very responsible and accountable, but I don't think the amount he drinks is healthy. We have been together for five years and I love him. He is my best friend but I don't like the path he is going down. \n\nIs there anything I can do to help him cut back? Is this normal drinking for someone who is 24 years old? Is it possible he will cut back naturally as he gets older? I know these questions are hard to answer when you don't even know him, but I need help in taking a next step. Maybe an intervention-ish, sit down talk? I'm at a loss. Thank you for any help in advance.",

   "selftext": "As the title says, I am in need of help. \n\nI am a long time drinker (started at 16, now 40). It started casually as is usually the case but escalated over the years due to tolerance and general bad decisions. I've never lost a job due to alcoholism but I'm sure a few relationships fell victim to it. I am happily married now and also happily employed. \n\nHere's where the trouble starts. For the past few years I have been a daily, blackout drunk drinker. I start when I come home from work and go until I can't drink anymore, eat dinner, and go to sleep. I do shots of rum with a beer chaser. In a night I probably consume 10-12 shots and 1-2 beers (I only use it to chase the rum). \n\nMy birthday was last week and my wife and I went on quite a bender. I woke from a nap on Saturday afternoon with excruciating hemorrhoids. I've had them for years but nothing like this. I couldn't move, couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, etc. I went to the doctor and it turns out I have three extremely large prolapsed 'roids basically blocking my anus. I am on nitroglycerin ointment to slowly cure it but I still have missed work everyday this week due to side effects of the medication and the immense pain.\n\nI haven't had a drink since waking up in this state and I am feeling this is the perfect opportunity to stop drinking. I am a regular weed smoker and have been doing that regularly since which has helped quite a bit (when I get high I feel zero urge to drink). (Also, per the rules, I am not on any substances at all save for my prescription butt ointment.)\n\nI guess I just needed to write this out so as to get support so I can really quit drinking. This seems like a great forum for advice so I thought I would just throw this out there.",

   "selftext": "I have been social drinker since college, about 15 years now. The past year, I\u2019ve gotten to know a group of people who love wine and had taken courses on wine. We meet up every month to have dinner with the wine teacher (I am not her student, but I tag along with a friend who is her student). There is a wine theme for every dinner, and we each bring a bottle of wine according to the theme chosen. There is usually 13-15 people, so 13-15 bottles of wine per dinner. We usually finish over 10 bottles. By the end, everyone struggles to finish the bottles and I feel pressure to drink more when all I wanted to do was go home.\n\nLast Friday was no exception, dinner was delicious. After the dinner, we headed to a cocktail bar. I ordered one cocktail. Others had ordered two drinks each and we end up splitting the bill equally. I end up paying more than I should. That\u2019s fine. After last call, one girl who was kinda drunk asked the bartender to make our group one more drink. The bartender makes us a small cocktail shot. It tasted awful, and I end up having to pay for that shot as well, which I didn\u2019t ask for. :(\n\nI got home that night around 3am exhausted as hell. The next few days I keep on having dreams about my ex who had cheated on me and the girl he cheated with (which happened a year ago). In one of the dream, I saw them together and I slapped him in the face many times, I was furious. I wake up from the dreams with profound sadness, feeling of wanting to die! Why? Why do I keep having bad dreams? It\u2019s been a year already! Even my friends think I should\u2019ve gotten over it already!\n\nI came to realized that alcohol is fucking up with my brain. I also noticed that I have developed a stutter, sometimes I can\u2019t find the right words to say or struggle to pronounce certain words or end up slurring the word. I also gained weight and my body got thicker.\n\nI\u2019m scared.\n\nI realized I was being peer pressured into drinking lots of wine at once, and that I have very little self-control. I was happy when I was drinking, but afterwards I get nightmares, I wake up feeling sad, lonely, and experience insomnia. I feel like I have a hole in my soul, and each day I wake up, I need to find things to fill up that hole.  \n\nAll these signs point to alcoholism and depression. \n\nI\u2019m glad I found this sub and hope you will all support me in this journey. \n\nThanks for reading.

   "selftext": "I quit drinking over 4 years ago, and in general have been doing very well since then despite a few small hiccups. When I first confessed I was an alcoholic to my boyfriend, he stopped drinking at home as well for at least two years, but he would still drink occasionally if we went out, or went to a party, etc., and very rarely to excess. I actually never asked him to do that ... he did it entirely on his own, and I consider him to be an extremely supportive person in general, aside from that\n\nAfter about two years of sobriety, I told him it was OK if he drank at home occasionally, because I didn't want my alcoholism to stand in the way of his freedom, especially now that I felt stronger.  At the same time, I believe I also mentioned that I would speak up if his drinking ever began to bother me, or if I had concerns, etc.\n\nWhich, of course, is what brings us to now. While his drinking is not extreme, it has become habitual (which I define as at least 2 drinks every day for the past 2+ weeks).  From my own experience with alcoholism, I believe the disease is very subtle in that it often takes years (or decades) to progress to the point where the individual's behavior begins to cross the line from \"socially acceptable\" into problematic. This can make identifying addiction problems in their early stages difficult. \n\nI plan on having a discussion with him tonight about all my concerns, but it's helpful (and cathartic) for me to get these feelings out in writing as well, which is probably the main reason for me posting. For instance, when I think of my own drinking, I am not sure what - if anything - would have gotten me to stop until I reached my own rock bottom. When I was simply habitually drinking, nothing would have gotten me to stop, so in some ways I feel like the disease needs to run its course until the alcoholic discovers what is really going on, and comes to some sort of epiphany.\n\nBut that was my own experience, and I'm not sure if everyone has the chance to come to that epiphany. And aside from that, and because his drinking is not yet extreme, I also wonder if I am somehow projecting my own disease onto him and seeing problematic behavior where it doesn't exist. \n\nHas anyone else been in a situation like this? How did it progress over time and how did you handle it? I sometimes feel like I am on \"the other side\" after entering recovery and am unable to see these issues clearly. On the other hand, maybe I am actually seeing everything incredibly clearly and I just need to be prepared. ",

   "selftext": "Some background for context on my situation. I went to rehab on my 21st birthday in June of 2012. After rehab I stayed sober for just over 5 years, but stopped participating in recovery after about 2 years. I was very bad off on \u201cspice\u201d when I went to rehab, because I was on probation and couldn\u2019t smoke weed. In August 2017 I decided that I should give social drinking a try, and quickly began smoking weed as it was always my favorite. In anticipation of graduating college I stopped smoking weed at the beginning of April so that I would be prepared to apply for jobs. I found that my anxiety skyrocketed, and I foolishly reached for the bottle in response to try and cope. My family has a history of alcoholism so I know how stupid this was, but I couldn\u2019t cope. I ended up holding it in the road and graduating Magna Cum Laude, but now I feel utterly lost. The alcohol I used to cope with the stress of my last few months of school is overtaking my life. I have been drinking more than 750ml of liquor a day, and it is starting to affect my relationships. I\u2019m too scared to stop because of the anxiety it creates, and some symptoms of withdrawal. I guess I\u2019m just looking for the answer I already know is correct. Go to detox, and seek out a recovery community. I just feel so much guilt over having to put the people I care about through this all over again. \n\nTL;DR: Drinking half a handle a day, feel like shit, feel guilty about it, know I should get sober, and just needed somewhere to share my feelings\n\nThanks for reading",

It got to a point where I'd get home from class around 1-2 in the afternoon and immediately pour myself a double vodka with Sprite zero. I went through 1/3 a handle on my worst days, but it wasn't always that bad. I could moderate easily in social situations, and it thankfully hasn't impacted my grades or relationships. But what started to concern me is that I started to drink alone 5-6 days of the week. I took a step back and looked at that behavior that had persisted for the better part of 6 months, and it scared me shitless. I have a family history of alcoholism and heart disease on my dad's side (my dad is a responsible drinker), and wanted to nip my vice in the bud, so to speak.\n\nAnyway, I decided to take a stand for myself, and started to research ways to responsibly stop that minimized withdrawals, and I tapered slowly for 4 days. 4 beers, 3 beers, 2 beers, one beer.

   "selftext": "I share my story in the hopes it will give someone the hope and strength they need to have the same experience I had to recover from alcoholism.  \nI was a nervous kid with lots of anxieties and adhd. I was off the walls and my head would never stop talking to me, I always seemed to overthink stuff. I never really felt like I was part of the group, like I was always on the outside looking in, even though I had friends.  I was never comfortable in my own skin. When I found booze I knew I found what was missing, looking back I was instantly addicted. I loved it, it made me feel like I could be the person I thought I wanted to be. I turned my life over to booze at the age of 13. Everything came second to booze. I chose a career where I could drink everyday working night shift as a waiter in restaurants. I had a shit tonne of fun and I was right in the middle of the action, I had arrived, I felt not only a part of, but almost like a leader of the party crew we had. Little did I know alcohol is a progressive disease and always gets worse, never better. My grandpa always said do something you love for a career, well I loved booze so I became a bartender... Lol.. (probably not what he meant) I ended up getting into cocaine which led me to my first treatment center. Funny thing is I wanted to quit coke so I could keep drinking, I never wanted to quit drinking, how could I ever have fun again without booze, life would be boring and mundane.... Shit was I wrong. Left that treatment center to drink the first night out. Then I moved towns and cocaine wasn't easy to find. I would come home after work and drink a 26er (750ml) of vodka by myself, pass out and wake up and puke a little bit..... Amazingly I actually thought I was doing good because I wasn't doing coke. My alcoholism progressed and I discovered the morning drink which was the death of me. I would drink the morning drink, trigger my allergy and keep drinking. In the end, after 20 yrs of hardcore drinking I had progressed to drinking around the clock, 4 or 5 day blackouts and I kept ending up on the hospital for medical detox as I was scared I would get seizures and die... It happens!.. Another treatment center only to drink the first day I got out again. In and out of AA for years, coming back over 30 times!... I was a hopeless alcoholic. I did want to drink but I couldn't imagine a life without it. How would I have the confidence to pick up women? To hang out with friends and be funny and the life of the party? How would I live life? I always had alcohol as a crutch to get me through the hard stuff in life.... Finally my family didn't want to talk to me anymore, not cus I was a bad drunk but they just couldn't stand by and watch me die, or come get their baby from the hospital shaking and on deaths door.... Again and again..... Finally my last drunk was a 4 day blackout, I knew I was going to die a lonely painful alcoholic death. I know to the core of my being that no matter what I do, I can not stop myself from picking up that first drink! I stood at the turning point, I was either going to commit suicide or completely turn my life over to a God I don't even think exists. I said to myself well if there is a God, I'm going to find out.... I got on my knees and I prayed, not like before but I honestly meant it and was willing to believe (there's no atheists when the plane is going down) I prayed to \"God\" and said I don't care what you would have me be, I completely give myself to you. You can have all of me and I meant it. I felt a weird feeling, like a 100 pound weight was taken from my shoulders. I was sick of following all the opinions and advice in AA, there is so much conflicting advice it's brutal. I said this time, I am doing it exactly how the first 100 men and women did it, if it isn't in the big book, I'm not doing it, nothing more, nothing less. It really worked back then, not now with all the treatment center bullshit. I studied that book like my life depended on it. I got a sponsor, I made a daily plan. Wake up, pray, make bed, red daily reflections, go to moon meeting, go to gym, read big nook, then night meeting, pray and go to bed. I did a meeting or 2 a day for the first year. I did my steps in the first 3 weeks, which is exactly how they are supposed to be done. I did them right out of the big book with the help of the Joe and Charlie speaker tapes... They are so amazing. They explain the book better than I've ever heard, I finally understood what to do... Today I am 9 yrs sober and I still call Joe and Charlie my program sponsors. I completely gave myself to AA even though I didn't believe in God and I hated AA and all those \"religious people\" and lame losers.... I found an amazing life. I made friends. I got involved with young people groups and we would go to dances and roundups, and bowling and kareoke and camping etc etc, I was the life of the sober party! I felt comfortable in my own skin! With the help of AA and \"God\" I walked through all those fears and lived life on life's terms and I thrived! ...... I started sponsoring people and they started getting sober. I ran Joe and Charlie step groups and helped others through the steps. I had a home group that I contributed to and ran the newcomers meeting for them before the main meeting. Today my life is honestly beyond my wildest dreams. When I sobered up I just wanted a little apartment and that would be great. I went back to school multiple times for different things, I learned how to be a mechanic and fix up jetskis and motorbikes, something I always wanted. I worked on boats and got other professional designations through school. I got jobs in top management for hospitality. Today I run my own successful business. I am happily married and have a dog and young daughter that makes me happier than I ever imagined I could be. I have a bunch of jetskis, boat, motorbike, etc. I own my own house on a large property. My life is amazing and I owe it all to AA...... If it weren't for AA I would be dead. I was a hopeless alcohol doomed to an alcoholic death but I was plucked from my own insanity by a power greater than me and have recovered from that seemingly hopeless state of mind and body.......i truly hope you all find your way. When. I tried to sober up without AA, sobriety was always something to endure, or fight through, and was very painful, with AA it made it so sobriety was something to be celebrated and enjoyed...  Here's a link to those tapes, pm me you email address if you want the sheets they talk about..... \nhttp://silkworth.net/pages/freestuff.php",

She\u2019s a great person sober and I love her very much. \n\nAll that being said I am new to this situation and wanted some advice on how to handle this. My wife pretty much just checks in on her, makes sure she\u2019s alive, and tries to make her drink some water. I\u2019ve been doing that plus making her small things to eat. I also took her car battery out last night because she has a ton of spare keys (wife takes her keys when she drinks so she has spares hidden everywhere). I know she\u2019ll get an Uber to the liquor store, but at least this way she\u2019s off the road. She does have major withdraw symptoms though, and she\u2019s had seizures after a binge in the past. This kind of worries me because she can\u2019t afford to pay someone to watch over her, and I certainly don\u2019t have time to do that between school and kids. I know she tends to buy wine coolers to help wean off but is that really safe? I\u2019m so lost here... I want to help but I don\u2019t really know how. \n\nThank you in advance for any advice/support ",

   "selftext": "I (so stupidly) got involved again with my ex 6 months ago, he is the one that I haven't ever been able to shake. We broke up (well, he ghosted me until I finally showed up at his house and he broke up with me THROUGH THE DOOR) because of my BPD. Cue two years of alcoholism and turmoil, finally starting to get over being without him but not over him. It took so much therapy, and I still barely made it out. One night out of the blue he sends me a text and says he needs me, stupid me leaves the next day to attend to him (like I have always done, and mind you he has never ever done for me) and we end up hooking up. After getting back together (secretly, he would never let me tell anyone and refused to let anyone know we were seeing each other again..which was a whole new kind of torment in itself), everything besides that seemed fine. He would talk to me, tell me he missed me, hearted me (refused to say love, but I understood that after our breakup because he said I hurt him so bad), we even exchanged cute Christmas presents and spent every moment we could together before he moved to a city that was 1.5 hours away. It all seemed great, like things were finally getting to the point where I could attempt to make things up to him and show him how much he meant to me. \n\nI violated my probation and had to go to jail for 3 months. He texted me once during the time that I was incarcerated, but the one text he sent consisted of \"I miss you, I had a dream that you were with me and I woke up just wanting to hold you.\" kinds of things. This really gave me hope and I got through being in jail rather well, considering I had confided in him before I went that I felt like me going to jail was going to doom us. \n\nI get out and send him a text and all I get was \"hey what are you doing today?\" and then nothing at all. It's been almost two weeks and I have received no reply and he even blocked me on Steam (gaming app for computer). I found out that during one of our usual festivals we mutually attend that one of my good friends was sitting in his lap a lot, which bothers me because I have had conversations with he about how I feel about him. I can't even ask him about it because at first I thought I was just being jealous and paranoid, but now he won't speak to me. I am off all of my meds and am not seeing a therapist because I have no insurance, so I feel like this is killing me. I want to talk to people about it but the only people who know (roommates and sister) probably won't want to listen because they warned me about this from the start. I know they'll be there for me but I feel ashamed to even talk about it anymore. I did this to myself, I feel so stupid. I knew he was bad for my mental health and I still let him get to me. Now I am left to pick up the pieces with not even a clue of what I did wrong this time. He held me and told me he wasn't going to ghost me again, not unless I did something very bad. To my knowledge I haven't done anything, and believe me I have ran everything through my head over and over again. I feel so broken, and I just want it to stop. Sorry for formatting/the lack of proper grammar in this post, I just had to get it out and I can't stop crying. Thanks for listening, it feels better to at least get some of this out.",

It's just a fun way to pass the time for now, though maybe someday I'll make something of it.  \n\nLooking for inspiration, I found this passage in Stephen King's *On Writing* and thought I'd share it with y'all creative types out there.  (King's been sober for almost 30 years, and IMO his recent work is some of his best; more importantly than that, he's *alive.*)\n\n&gt;\"The idea that creative endeavor and mind-altering substances are entwined is one of the great pop-intellectual myths of our time.  The four twentieth-century writers whose work is most responsible for it are probably Hemmingway, Fitzgerald, Sherwood Anderson, and the poet Dylan Thomas.  They are the writers who largely formed our vision of an existential English-speaking wasteland where people have been cut off from one another and live in an atmosphere of emotional strangulation and despair.  These concepts are very familiar to most alcoholics; the common reaction to them is amusement.  Substance-abusing writers are just substance abusers - common garden-variety drunks and druggies, in other words.  Any claims that the drugs and alcohol are necessary to dull a finer sensibility are just the usual self-serving bullshit.  I've heard alcoholic snowplow drivers make the same claim, that they drink to still the demons.  **It doesn't matter if you're James Jones, John Cheever, or a stewbum snoozing in Penn Station; for an addict, the right to the drink or drug of choice must be preserved at all costs.  Hemmingway and Fitzgerald didn't drink because they were creative, alienated, or morally weak.  They drank because it's what alkies are wired up to do.**  Creative people probably *do* run a greater risk of alcoholism and addiction than those in some other jobs, but so what?  We all look pretty much the same when we're puking in the gutter.\"",

   "selftext": "You know, I wish I could drink like a normal person. I laughed at the thought of me EVER becoming an alcoholic. More and more I'm seeing that drinking is a problem and is affecting my life negatively. I grew up in AA. Literally, I remember being 5 years old and listening to the meeting while I colored. It felt like home. I loved the smell of coffee and cigarettes, and listening to deep conversations. I felt safe there, but never did I think I would end up in their seats. My mom and step father were and still are extremely active in the group. The thought of ME ever sitting in a meeting for myself? Yeah, that's humorous \\- but I'm seeing now that I probably need it.\n\nI began drinking socially every Friday night out with friends about a year and a half ago. Before then I could go out to bars and clubs, and have no desire to drink. I didn't understand the appeal until my first drunken night and it was over from there. I was at the time \\(now engaged and living with my fianc\u00e9\\) a single mom who needed the outlet. But I began going out more, leaving my son with babysitters. The time out got longer and how drunk I was got worse. I remember experiencing my first hangover and saying I'll never do that again. That was a lie. I was drinking to get over my narcissistic ex whom I was deeply in love with and hurt by.\n\nFast\\-foward to when I met my fianc\u00e9 a little over a year ago. I was the party girl, but I hated that because I never was that way before. When I met him, suddenly CRAZY behavior started coming out. I would go insane sometimes, fighting with him. I was always the fun drunk but something about him made me lose a screw. One night I became drunkenly suicidal after what was supposed to be a fun night out with him and friends. I've had several of those, all with him. I feel so bad for what I've put him through... Honestly, I was horrible. Because of that, we quit \"going out\" and binging. Now we take it easy more at home. When we have gone out, I prove to him I won't binge drink. It's manipulation so that he will think I'm fine and without a problem when I drink at home. I think, \"ok, don't get sloppy drunk. Get a little buzz, but no hangover the next morning... that way you can drink regularly at home. You need that more than a party one night\". Crazy! Just this past weekend we went out with friends and I watched a few of my friends get shit\\-faced. I told my fianc\u00e9, \"aren't you happy I'm not drinking like that anymore?\" It's disgusting, but I did that to get the \"free pass\" to drink more. If I'm not out of control \\(seemingly\\) then he won't be mad at me for drinking. I've even began to hide it, though. :\\(\n\nYet, my drinking at night never stopped. I now have a glass or two of wine, but pour extra when he's not looking. I've even moved on to hard liquor. I'm getting skilled at pretending I'm not drunk, but I am almost every single night. Last night he wasn't home \\- he hasn't been home for a week due to a business trip. I drank EVERY NIGHT, alone. Last night I got hammered. I drank a whole bottle of wine \\(I'm petite\\) and made a huge mistake that will likely ruin my relationship. I woke up the next morning and told myself I'm going to quit. I considered a meeting, but wouldn't want my fianc\u00e9 to know I was going, so I didn't go. I don't want to admit I have a problem. If I admit that, then I have to really quit. Does that make sense? Like I would normally be having my first drink of the night \\(9pm\\) after my son is asleep... but I'm TRYING to resist. I honestly might drink tonight.... but at least I'm admitting this. I'm afraid of quitting because I equate drinking with fun. How will I ever have fun or mask any of my emotional pain again? UGH.

I took him to the emergency room and he was transferred to a shithole behavioral health center for a week until he was no longer suicidal. \n\nHe came back from the facility optimistic but hadn\u2019t really received significant assistance, except that they got him in with a weekly psychiatrist and psychologist. \n\nFast forward to this last weekend:\n\nI visited my mom for Mother\u2019s Day (five hours away). I felt like I hadn\u2019t been able to leave town for a while because of my dude\u2019s anxiety, and on Sunday morning he just stopped texting me. I called him, he answered, and told me he doesn\u2019t want to do it anymore. That he couldn\u2019t. He was crying and angry and downright sounded delusional. I wouldn\u2019t wish that phone call on anyone. I tried to keep him on the line and make him promise to me that he wouldn\u2019t hurt himself, and he just told me he thought he needed to take a nap and promised me he wasn\u2019t lying. \n\nThankfully I did not trust him at his word. I called a friend who was close by to go to his house, and another friend who called a police wellness check on him and called an attorney for an involuntary hospital admission if he refused to get help. The friend who headed to his house found him with his pills out about to take them. They talked until his mother made it up to his house and took him to his psychologist, who referred him to a nicer facility where he is now. He\u2019s now stabilized but will probably be there for a while. \n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019m watching his dogs (who I also love but are a lot to handle), and developed a flea infestation, so I had to stay with a friend for a night and bomb everything and take a day from work to clean. I drove three hours to see him last night for an hour of visitation, and I\u2019ve been staying with his mom (who is wonderful) every night. \n\nI feel responsible for him because everyone in his life has told him that I saved him\u2014not just from his suicide attempts, but by intervening in his alcoholism.\n\nI\u2019m scared that I got myself in too deep with a person I thought I could fix because of things that happened to me in my childhood. I\u2019m so scared that he\u2019s going to get out again prematurely and I\u2019ll have to get him to a hospital again, or worse, find him dead. \n\nWhen he\u2019s feeling good, he\u2019s wonderful. No one deserves to feel the kind of anguish he felt on Sunday night when he tried to kill himself. I\u2019m just afraid I\u2019m not strong enough to love him through this, and if I step out of the situation I\u2019m afraid he will not make it. I should say\u2014he\u2019s feeling better at the moment, and I\u2019m very hopeful he\u2019ll recover. But I don\u2019t know if I want to take the chance that he won\u2019t. I don\u2019t know that I want to be around if this treatment doesn\u2019t work. This has all been so painful and I feel like an awful person for even thinking of giving up on him.\n\nI\u2019m trying to get in with a counselor but the place that I found that takes my insurance can\u2019t schedule me for two more weeks. I can\u2019t talk to my family because I feel like they expect me to be okay always. A lot of my friends have been asking where I\u2019ve been lately, and I can\u2019t tell them. They think I\u2019m an asshole for dropping out on them but I feel like I\u2019m struggling just to keep everything going. I feel like I\u2019m dysfunctional at work because I\u2019m so distracted. \n\nEverything everything everything hurts right now. I lost my dad a few years back and this feels like the shock of that loss but protracted because I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to lose him or not. I don\u2019t want to hurt myself but I kinda feel the impulse to run away even though I know that\u2019s not an option.\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend tried to commit suicide and I\u2019ve been in the position of directing him to be admitted.\nFeeling crushed under the tremendous weight of keeping someone else going. Having trouble completing everyday things for myself. Also, my apartment developed a flea infestation and I can\u2019t stop vacuuming.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n",

   "selftext": "I share my story in the hopes it will give someone the hope and strength they need to have the same experience I had to recover from alcoholism.  \nI was a nervous kid with lots of anxieties and adhd. I was off the walls and my head would never stop talking to me, I always seemed to overthink stuff. I never really felt like I was part of the group, like I was always on the outside looking in, even though I had friends.  I was never comfortable in my own skin. When I found booze I knew I found what was missing, looking back I was instantly addicted. I loved it, it made me feel like I could be the person I thought I wanted to be. I turned my life over to booze at the age of 13. Everything came second to booze. I chose a career where I could drink everyday working night shift as a waiter in restaurants. I had a shit tonne of fun and I was right in the middle of the action, I had arrived, I felt not only a part of, but almost like a leader of the party crew we had. Little did I know alcohol is a progressive disease and always gets worse, never better. My grandpa always said do something you love for a career, well I loved booze so I became a bartender... Lol.. (probably not what he meant) I ended up getting into cocaine which led me to my first treatment center. Funny thing is I wanted to quit coke so I could keep drinking, I never wanted to quit drinking, how could I ever have fun again without booze, life would be boring and mundane.... Shit was I wrong. Left that treatment center to drink the first night out. Then I moved towns and cocaine wasn't easy to find. I would come home after work and drink a 26er (750ml) of vodka by myself, pass out and wake up and puke a little bit..... Amazingly I actually thought I was doing good because I wasn't doing coke. My alcoholism progressed and I discovered the morning drink which was the death of me. I would drink the morning drink, trigger my allergy and keep drinking. In the end, after 20 yrs of hardcore drinking I had progressed to drinking around the clock, 4 or 5 day blackouts and I kept ending up on the hospital for medical detox as I was scared I would get seizures and die... It happens!.. Another treatment center only to drink the first day I got out again. In and out of AA for years, coming back over 30 times!... I was a hopeless alcoholic. I did want to drink but I couldn't imagine a life without it. How would I have the confidence to pick up women? To hang out with friends and be funny and the life of the party? How would I live life? I always had alcohol as a crutch to get me through the hard stuff in life.... Finally my family didn't want to talk to me anymore, not cus I was a bad drunk but they just couldn't stand by and watch me die, or come get their baby from the hospital shaking and on deaths door.... Again and again..... Finally my last drunk was a 4 day blackout, I knew I was going to die a lonely painful alcoholic death. I know to the core of my being that no matter what I do, I can not stop myself from picking up that first drink! I stood at the turning point, I was either going to commit suicide or completely turn my life over to a God I don't even think exists. I said to myself well if there is a God, I'm going to find out.... I got on my knees and I prayed, not like before but I honestly meant it and was willing to believe (there's no atheists when the plane is going down) I prayed to \"God\" and said I don't care what you would have me be, I completely give myself to you. You can have all of me and I meant it. I felt a weird feeling, like a 100 pound weight was taken from my shoulders. I was sick of following all the opinions and advice in AA, there is so much conflicting advice it's brutal. I said this time, I am doing it exactly how the first 100 men and women did it, if it isn't in the big book, I'm not doing it, nothing more, nothing less. It really worked back then, not now with all the treatment center bullshit. I studied that book like my life depended on it. I got a sponsor, I made a daily plan. Wake up, pray, make bed, red daily reflections, go to moon meeting, go to gym, read big nook, then night meeting, pray and go to bed. I did a meeting or 2 a day for the first year. I did my steps in the first 3 weeks, which is exactly how they are supposed to be done. I did them right out of the big book with the help of the Joe and Charlie speaker tapes... They are so amazing. They explain the book better than I've ever heard, I finally understood what to do... Today I am 9 yrs sober and I still call Joe and Charlie my program sponsors. I completely gave myself to AA even though I didn't believe in God and I hated AA and all those \"religious people\" and lame losers.... I found an amazing life. I made friends. I got involved with young people groups and we would go to dances and roundups, and bowling and kareoke and camping etc etc, I was the life of the sober party! I felt comfortable in my own skin! With the help of AA and \"God\" I walked through all those fears and lived life on life's terms and I thrived! ...... I started sponsoring people and they started getting sober. I ran Joe and Charlie step groups and helped others through the steps. I had a home group that I contributed to and ran the newcomers meeting for them before the main meeting. Today my life is honestly beyond my wildest dreams. When I sobered up I just wanted a little apartment and that would be great. I went back to school multiple times for different things, I learned how to be a mechanic and fix up jetskis and motorbikes, something I always wanted. I worked on boats and got other professional designations through school. I got jobs in top management for hospitality. Today I run my own successful business. I am happily married and have a dog and young daughter that makes me happier than I ever imagined I could be. I have a bunch of jetskis, boat, motorbike, etc. I own my own house on a large property. My life is amazing and I owe it all to AA...... If it weren't for AA I would be dead. I was a hopeless alcohol doomed to an alcoholic death but I was plucked from my own insanity by a power greater than me and have recovered from that seemingly hopeless state of mind and body.......i truly hope you all find your way. When. I tried to sober up without AA, sobriety was always something to endure, or fight through, and was very painful, with AA it made it so sobriety was something to be celebrated and enjoyed",

   "selftext": "I am 30 years old and have a history of drinking very heavily. I have blacked out countless times. I have driven drunk countless times and several times not even remembering the drive home or the end of the night at which point I decided to leave wherever I was. I have done many embarrassing things while drunk such as making out with a girl that I would not have otherwise chosen in a very public popular hometown bar, falling asleep at a bar and being kicked out for trying to take off my shoes because my feet were swelling up, cheating on my girlfriend by going to a strip club and getting a blow job from the stripper during a private dance, passing out at a country concert and getting wheeled out by the paramedics in front of my girlfriend and her family, passing out on the floor at my parents house and waking up in a puddle of urine only to have my mother\u2019s heart broken when she found out what happened later, blowing-out the tires on my truck when I smashed into a curb in a parking lot while driving recklessly, showing up to work so hungover I was running to the bathroom every 20 minutes to puke and reeking of alcohol still, etc. the list goes on...passing out on the couch at parties, missing the ball drop on New Years, hitting on coworkers that are friends but have boyfriends already, hooking up with the wrong people and then creating more awkwardness for myself later, posting embarrassing videos to Snapchat that I will later regret cause I just look stupid and wasted...on and on it goes. \n\nI have taken many breaks from alcohol of course. A week here a month there. Usually after something really bad happens... but I always say, ok I\u2019ll never do that again. I\u2019ll just stop drinking once I\u2019ve had my fill and I\u2019ll uber home. It starts slow usually. A few glasses of wine a night. A bottle of wine a few nights a week just to relax after a hard stressful day. To forget how bored I am of life. Or how pathetic my behavior has been. To forget how disappointed I am in myself. Sometimes it seems like I have it under control for months and months at a time. Nothing too bad happening. Only mild hangovers. And then one night I just feel too good about myself and I want to celebrate. Maybe someone strokes my ego and I feel like I deserve to live it up! I am thirsty, and after all I haven\u2019t gone hard in a while so fuck it. I go hard. I am a bottomless pit. I have an unquenchable thirst for more. I tell myself that the bartender must love me right now for the bill I\u2019m racking up. I am egotistical and cocky. Throwing caution to the wind. Autopilot. The judicial system in my brain is switched off and I act before I think. I don\u2019t think I just do things impulsively. God have mercy!! Drink after drink. Sometimes I am horrified looking back at how much I had. Nobody seems to notice either! I hold my liquor very well all the way up until the last few that just shut me down. 5 or 6 hours later I am waking up early in the morning for water and getting small fragmented flashbacks of the night before. I already know I am going to be riddled with guilt and shame once the rest of the booze are processed by my liver and kidneys. Never! Never again I say!!! \n\nI last had a drink about 9 days ago. It was more than a drink; it was nearly an entire bottle of Cazadores tequila. I wanted to get away so I decided to go camping. I went out by myself to the beach. A solo camping trip. I knew I wouldn\u2019t need to drive once I was at the campsite since I had everything I needed out there. There weren\u2019t many other campers there so I basically had the place to myself. I started with a few beers early on. Eventually I switched to the grapefruit and tequila. (Much more tequila than grapefruit.) I sat by the fire and I got shit faced by myself in the woods by the beach. The next day I was terribly hungover. Perhaps even poisoned. I threw up I think seven times and couldn\u2019t hold food down for very long. I was even laughing at how ridiculous of a person I am choosing to be. I have been listening to a lot of Jordan Peterson lately and I am really trying to apply his ideas to my life. I know it is not enough to just think about it, I have to stay committed to sobriety. \n\nI have been sober for 9 days now and have been running and working out almost everyday. I have also been eating really well. Low carb and healthy lean fats and veggies. I feel great. I look healthy and I feel healthy. My thinking feels clear and sharp and fast. I have been keeping busy, catching up on audibles, getting things done, taking care of business. I don\u2019t want this healthy feeling to go away and so the few times I have been tempted to go out for a beer this past week, I chose not to. I choose a big healthy meal instead. Sometimes I can\u2019t get to sleep until 3 in the morning, but fuck it. Being a little tired the next day is still better than the alternative that I just described above. If you are reading this and you are like me, just know you will be happy you didn\u2019t drink today. It\u2019s Friday. You might feel lame for staying in. That\u2019s ok. Tomorrow will come. Little by little you will accomplish your goals. You will be better. If you\u2019re feeling like you need an escape, don\u2019t. Stay and fight. Don\u2019t choose weakness. Get angry. Get edgy. Feel frustration. Be ok with the suffering. That\u2019s ok. Go be better. Go do better. Go be harder. \n\nGodspeed. \ud83e\udd19",

   "selftext": "Let me start off by saying I\u2019m 14 yrs old and my sister was sent to foster care because of what I\u2019m about to get in to. The court is involved as well as cps. I\u2019m able to get into foster care but I\u2019m hesitant. If you just want to know what he did without long explanations I made a short summary below.\n\nSHORT SUMMARY.\nMy father has sexually assaulted me. He kissed me several times putting his tongue in my mouth, touched my buttocks with the intention of having sex, slapped my buttocks, and did other things like pulling my underwear up to see it. I told my mom but she doesn\u2019t want to kick him out even though my sister left to foster care because of him. I\u2019m thinking about leaving to foster care but I don\u2019t know if it will turn out okay. I love my pets, I love my mom (dispite what she\u2019s doing), I\u2019m nervous about what will happen when I\u2019m out of the system, and lastly what if foster care is worse then the situation I\u2019m in now? I\u2019m really considering leaving but these things are holding me back. Advice would be appreciated. Thank you. I\u2019ll update if I can.\n\nBelow are details to my situation. They are quite long though. And they are listed in chronological order.\n \nThe beginning.\nIt all started when I was 5 to 7 years old. My biological father inappropriately kissed me. It wasn\u2019t even a kiss. He.. made out with me. I was uncomfortable. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t tell my mom or say \u201cstop.\u201d But I just kinda backed up and away from him. This happened twice and I just thought \u201cwell this is what parents do.\u201d\n\nThe worst thing that he ever did.\nI always used to sleep in my parents bedroom because I was afraid of the dark. (I slept in their bed until I was 11. I know that\u2019s awhile) almost every other day they would have sex where I was around them. That was a poor choice in my opinion. I believe that\u2019s what caused me to begin understanding what sex was even when I was 3-4. In my parents defense they did try many times to take me out of the bedroom when I was sleeping there but I was so afraid of the dark I would go back. I never brought it up to them that I could hear them. So when I was 7 to 8 I was sleeping unlike  usual I was sleeping between my parents. My father was drunk. In his words he \u201cthought I was Mom.\u201d I woke up to him slowly placing his hand down from my lower back to my buttocks. This was the most traumatic. Because I don\u2019t know if his penis touched me or not. It was unusually smooth compared to the texture of a hand. I was so scared..I realized if I didn\u2019t act he might continue further. He was behind me so I ended up kicking him of me multiple times with a lot of force. I also made a complaining/angry sound. (Like the one you hear from a kid who doesn\u2019t get the toy they want but they don\u2019t actually scream.) he then took whatever it was out from my underwear/pants. This is what caused me to be extremely uncomfortable kissing, hugging, and sitting around him for years to come. The next morning he said \u201c*my name* I\u2019m sorry I-uhh thought you were Mom. I was- drunk.\u201d My Mom was present. She either heard me kick and complain or he told her. (I don\u2019t know if he downplayed it or not.)\n\nHe continued.\nYes I understand that parents/family from other countries do other things like for ex a mom telling her older daughter \u201cyou look so sexy in that dress!\u201d (Or lightly) \u201cthe boys are gonna be all over you!\u201d or (in some cases) hit each others butts?? (That is just weird I don\u2019t know why. Kind of like how coaches dismiss their team.) anyway I was never introduced/seen this in my family. Until.. one day. (Bear in mind I didn\u2019t know the difference between leggings and tights when I was 10-11. Stupid I know. But these particular tights were very thick winter tights for cold days with dresses. So they actually covered a lot more then you\u2019d expect.) one day I decided to wear just these tights around the house. When I came to get dinner nobody minded. Until my slightly drunk father saw me.. jokingly he made a disappointed sound like \u201cehh!\u201d And slapped my buttocks. I was taken aback by this. I literally hissed and yelled at him \u201cHEY!\u201d With an angry expression. This definitely means a hard no. He backed off and ignored it.\n\nLastly this year.\nMy sister is in foster care because she said my dad used to kiss her inappropriately. But she left mostly because of my parents alcoholism. I read the accusations. I wanted to believe \u201cmy dad was just joking around and he didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t Mom\u201d I lied to myself so much that I believed it. Till now.\nA few months ago he did it again. Not as bad but this just made me realized. This is fucked up. What happened was not a joke or mistake. He did this on purpose. One day DURNING HIS COURTCASE AGAINST MY SISTER. I was behind my mom sitting on the couch watching tv. He walked up behind me and lifted my underwear up to see it. I was shocked. I quickly turned around and shot him an angry look. I walked around to sit on the closest couch beside my mom.\n\nMy mom isn\u2019t ignorant to all this..\nOn April 19 this year I told my mom. This was 2 weeks after he looked at my underwear. I told her everything. I cried a lot. And I was worried she would not believe me. She did. She was super supportive. I trusted her... and not a day later I realized she still wants to be with him.. I brought it up one day in the car. \u201cWhat are we gonna do now? I don\u2019t want him to pick me up. He makes me super uncomfortable.\u201d My mom said \u201cI\u2019ll tell him to leave you alone. It\u2019s going to take time!\u201d I said \u201cBut Mom  it\u2019s hard to do. I feel like I\u2019m betraying *insert my sisters name* for not doing anything..\u201d my mom then said \u201c *insert my name*! It\u2019s going to take awhile!.. you can move out when you 18.\u201d I took a while to get it out. \u201cWhat do you mean 18.. I can\u2019t wait that long. I can\u2019t stay like this! I told you because I don\u2019t want to go to fostercare!\u201d My Mom: \u201cWHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO. I HAVE A JOB. YOUR FATHER HAS EVERYTHING UNDER HIS NAME.\u201d Me: \u201cHOW LONG IS IT GOING TO TAKE? I CAN\u2019T WAIT ANY LONGER. I FEEL UNSAFE AROUND HIM. HE DROVE AWAY *my sister* AND *my brother* DO YOU CARE?\u201d My mom \u201cthen what.. WHAT DO WE DO. If they know he\u2019s going to jail!\u201d Me \u201cthen I won\u2019t say anything! Why can\u2019t you just tell him to move out! We can\u2019t just have him here!\u201d My mom \u201cHE WILL BECOME HOMELESS.\u201d Me \u201cYOU\u2019RE ASKING ME TO WAIT 4 YEARS TO BECOME COMFORTABLE? I FEEL LIKE YOU DONT CARE. CAN JUST GO TO FOSTER CARE AND WAIT UNTIL HE MOVES OUT AND EVERYTHING IS SOLVED.\u201d My Mom \u201cthen what are you supposed to tell cps huh?\u201d Me \u201cMom.. I can\u2019t wait anymore I don\u2019t think it can last two more weeks.\u201d My mom \u201cokay. I\u2019ll tell him to move out on Sunday. OKAY. Don\u2019t push me! I only learned yesterday!\u201d It didn\u2019t happen.. then a week later she told my dad and we all \u2018talked\u2019. He denied everything. He pitied himself. He mocked me jokingly.\n\nMy mom now is on his side. Here\u2019s her excuses.\nI talked to my mom 1 week ago. She convinced me that \u201cwhen you leave foster care at 18 then what? They [refering to my sisters foster parents] won\u2019t help you! Their job IS DONE.\u201d I\u2019m scared that when I leave I won\u2019t know what to do. She also said \u201che said it was a mistake. He comes from a different country.\u201d I told her \u201cparents don\u2019t do that. No country EVER treats their kids this way\u201d my mom also said \u201cIt happened a long time ago. You may remember it differently.\u201d I said \u201cI remember it clearly. I always told myself it was normal but it\u2019s not.\u201d My Mom \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell him no?\u201d Me \u201cI didn\u2019t say no because my actions clearly showed that his actions made me unhappy.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going on now?\nI\u2019m still with my parents. My dad hasn\u2019t left. I try bringing it up but my mom either changes the subject constantly, gets irritated and defends my dad, or shakes her head and leaves. The only change is that I try to avoid my dad as much as possible and respond to him only if I feel like there\u2019s no other choice. I also keep my responses short. He tries to interact with me even though I only respond coldly. But I feel it\u2019s important to say the only things keeping me back from leaving is my pets (they are my family I love them.), my mom (I love my mom. When I\u2019m around her she feels like how a parent should be like. Loving, caring, funny, supportive, etc. I really up til this point feel like she has been what a parent should be.), my future (I feel like when I\u2019m out of foster care. There\u2019s nobody who\u2019s gonna support me.), the people (will the people be better or worse), school and friends, (my friends treat me like family. They are just amazing human beings with big hearts.), my other family (great people. especially my grandfather who I just met. My grandma.. she\u2019s a wonderful person. My other grandmother is also amazing.)",

   "selftext": "Updates are in comments. But I also write them at the very bottom.\n\nLet me start off by saying I\u2019m 14 yrs old and my sister was sent to foster care because of what I\u2019m about to get in to. The court is involved as well as cps. I\u2019m able to get into foster care but I\u2019m hesitant. If you just want to know what he did without long explanations I made a short summary below.\n\nSHORT SUMMARY.\nMy father has sexually assaulted me. He kissed me several times putting his tongue in my mouth, touched my buttocks with the intention of having sex, slapped my buttocks, and did other things like pulling my underwear up to see it. I told my mom but she doesn\u2019t want to kick him out even though my sister left to foster care because of him. I\u2019m thinking about leaving to foster care but I don\u2019t know if it will turn out okay. I love my pets, I love my mom (dispite what she\u2019s doing), I\u2019m nervous about what will happen when I\u2019m out of the system, and lastly what if foster care is worse then the situation I\u2019m in now? I\u2019m really considering leaving but these things are holding me back. Advice would be appreciated. Thank you. I\u2019ll update if I can.\n\n\nBelow are details to my situation. They are quite long though. And they are listed in chronological order.\n \nThe beginning.\nIt all started when I was 5 to 7 years old. My biological father inappropriately kissed me. It wasn\u2019t even a kiss. He.. made out with me. I was uncomfortable. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t tell my mom or say \u201cstop.\u201d But I just kinda backed up and away from him. This happened twice and I just thought \u201cwell this is what parents do.\u201d\n\nThe worst thing that he ever did.\nI always used to sleep in my parents bedroom because I was afraid of the dark. (I slept in their bed until I was 11. I know that\u2019s awhile) almost every other day they would have sex where I was around them. That was a poor choice in my opinion. I believe that\u2019s what caused me to begin understanding what sex was even when I was 3-4. In my parents defense they did try many times to take me out of the bedroom when I was sleeping there but I was so afraid of the dark I would go back. I never brought it up to them that I could hear them. So when I was 7 to 8 I was sleeping unlike  usual I was sleeping between my parents. My father was drunk. In his words he \u201cthought I was Mom.\u201d I woke up to him slowly placing his hand down from my lower back to my buttocks. This was the most traumatic. Because I don\u2019t know if his penis touched me or not. It was unusually smooth compared to the texture of a hand. I was so scared..I realized if I didn\u2019t act he might continue further. He was behind me so I ended up kicking him of me multiple times with a lot of force. I also made a complaining/angry sound. (Like the one you hear from a kid who doesn\u2019t get the toy they want but they don\u2019t actually scream.) he then took whatever it was out from my underwear/pants. This is what caused me to be extremely uncomfortable kissing, hugging, and sitting around him for years to come. The next morning he said \u201c*my name* I\u2019m sorry I-uhh thought you were Mom. I was- drunk.\u201d My Mom was present. She either heard me kick and complain or he told her. (I don\u2019t know if he downplayed it or not.)\n\nHe continued.\nYes I understand that parents/family from other countries do other things like for ex a mom telling her older daughter \u201cyou look so sexy in that dress!\u201d (Or lightly) \u201cthe boys are gonna be all over you!\u201d or (in some cases) hit each others butts?? (That is just weird I don\u2019t know why. Kind of like how coaches dismiss their team.) anyway I was never introduced/seen this in my family. Until.. one day. (Bear in mind I didn\u2019t know the difference between leggings and tights when I was 10-11. Stupid I know. But these particular tights were very thick winter tights for cold days with dresses. So they actually covered a lot more then you\u2019d expect.) one day I decided to wear just these tights around the house. When I came to get dinner nobody minded. Until my slightly drunk father saw me.. jokingly he made a disappointed sound like \u201cehh!\u201d And slapped my buttocks. I was taken aback by this. I literally hissed and yelled at him \u201cHEY!\u201d With an angry expression. This definitely means a hard no. He backed off and ignored it.\n\nLastly this year.\nMy sister is in foster care because she said my dad used to kiss her inappropriately. But she left mostly because of my parents alcoholism. I read the accusations. I wanted to believe \u201cmy dad was just joking around and he didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t Mom\u201d I lied to myself so much that I believed it. Till now.\nA few months ago he did it again. Not as bad but this just made me realized. This is fucked up. What happened was not a joke or mistake. He did this on purpose. One day DURNING HIS COURTCASE AGAINST MY SISTER. I was behind my mom sitting on the couch watching tv. He walked up behind me and lifted my underwear up to see it. I was shocked. I quickly turned around and shot him an angry look. I walked around to sit on the closest couch beside my mom.\n\nMy mom isn\u2019t ignorant to all this..\nOn April 19 this year I told my mom. This was 2 weeks after he looked at my underwear. I told her everything. I cried a lot. And I was worried she would not believe me. She did. She was super supportive. I trusted her... and not a day later I realized she still wants to be with him.. I brought it up one day in the car. \u201cWhat are we gonna do now? I don\u2019t want him to pick me up. He makes me super uncomfortable.\u201d My mom said \u201cI\u2019ll tell him to leave you alone. It\u2019s going to take time!\u201d I said \u201cBut Mom  it\u2019s hard to do. I feel like I\u2019m betraying *insert my sisters name* for not doing anything..\u201d my mom then said \u201c *insert my name*! It\u2019s going to take awhile!.. you can move out when you 18.\u201d I took a while to get it out. \u201cWhat do you mean 18.. I can\u2019t wait that long. I can\u2019t stay like this! I told you because I don\u2019t want to go to fostercare!\u201d My Mom: \u201cWHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO. I HAVE A JOB. YOUR FATHER HAS EVERYTHING UNDER HIS NAME.\u201d Me: \u201cHOW LONG IS IT GOING TO TAKE? I CAN\u2019T WAIT ANY LONGER. I FEEL UNSAFE AROUND HIM. HE DROVE AWAY *my sister* AND *my brother* DO YOU CARE?\u201d My mom \u201cthen what.. WHAT DO WE DO. If they know he\u2019s going to jail!\u201d Me \u201cthen I won\u2019t say anything! Why can\u2019t you just tell him to move out! We can\u2019t just have him here!\u201d My mom \u201cHE WILL BECOME HOMELESS.\u201d Me \u201cYOU\u2019RE ASKING ME TO WAIT 4 YEARS TO BECOME COMFORTABLE? I FEEL LIKE YOU DONT CARE. CAN JUST GO TO FOSTER CARE AND WAIT UNTIL HE MOVES OUT AND EVERYTHING IS SOLVED.\u201d My Mom \u201cthen what are you supposed to tell cps huh?\u201d Me \u201cMom.. I can\u2019t wait anymore I don\u2019t think it can last two more weeks.\u201d My mom \u201cokay. I\u2019ll tell him to move out on Sunday. OKAY. Don\u2019t push me! I only learned yesterday!\u201d It didn\u2019t happen.. then a week later she told my dad and we all \u2018talked\u2019. He denied everything. He pitied himself. He mocked me jokingly.\n\nMy mom now is on his side. Here\u2019s her excuses.\nI talked to my mom 1 week ago. She convinced me that \u201cwhen you leave foster care at 18 then what? They [refering to my sisters foster parents] won\u2019t help you! Their job IS DONE.\u201d I\u2019m scared that when I leave I won\u2019t know what to do. She also said \u201che said it was a mistake. He comes from a different country.\u201d I told her \u201cparents don\u2019t do that. No country EVER treats their kids this way\u201d my mom also said \u201cIt happened a long time ago. You may remember it differently.\u201d I said \u201cI remember it clearly. I always told myself it was normal but it\u2019s not.\u201d My Mom \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell him no?\u201d Me \u201cI didn\u2019t say no because my actions clearly showed that his actions made me unhappy.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going on now?\nI\u2019m still with my parents. My dad hasn\u2019t left. I try bringing it up but my mom either changes the subject constantly, gets irritated and defends my dad, or shakes her head and leaves. The only change is that I try to avoid my dad as much as possible and respond to him only if I feel like there\u2019s no other choice. I also keep my responses short. He tries to interact with me even though I only respond coldly. But I feel it\u2019s important to say the only things keeping me back from leaving is my pets (they are my family I love them.), my mom (I love my mom. When I\u2019m around her she feels like how a parent should be like. Loving, caring, funny, supportive, etc. I really up til this point feel like she has been what a parent should be.), my future (I feel like when I\u2019m out of foster care. There\u2019s nobody who\u2019s gonna support me.), the people (will the people be better or worse), school and friends, (my friends treat me like family. They are just amazing human beings with big hearts.), my other family (great people. especially my grandfather who I just met. My grandma.. she\u2019s a wonderful person. My other grandmother is also amazing.)\n\nUPDATES:\nmy sister contacted my social worker and she will get back to me on Wednesday as she is taking a vacation. I chose 2 people who may be able to foster me. One friend is  asking her mom. Wish me luck guys. &lt;3\n\nI\u2019m currently in a foster home with my sister. They\u2019re super nice people I\u2019ve been here for about a week.",

Probably under the legal limit, but still.  I don't know though, I don't feel that bad about it.  I guess, now that I'm reflecting on it I think it was a bad choice.  I kind of feel like, \"I didn't even get drunk.  It's not like I did anything wrong.\"  But I also feel like it's a gateway that will lead me right back to drinking a bottle of whiskey a night.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this?  I don't plan on drinking tomorrow or in the near future, but I am only 3 weeks sober from having drunk a 1/2  bottle to a bottle a night for about 3 years.  Am I lying to myself thinking that this isn't a big deal?\n\nEdit: The worst part is, right before I went to bed I looked in my bathroom mirror and, for the first time since  I stopped drinking I really looked at myself, and I almost didn't recognize myself.  I have had a puffy face for years and tonight I actually looked totally different.  No puffiness, no redness.  I looked pretty great.  I can't stress how much of a change it was.  And it made me sad that I made a mistake by drinking.  It made me realize I need to keep up being sober because I am actually seeing results.  Maybe cutting ~1500 cal. out of my day will make me lose some weight as well.",

It was like I was thrown in a river the moment I was born and with every year I was abused as a child and  with every trauma I suffered, that river got swifter and more treacherous, always leading towards a huge waterfall that spilled into an abyss.\n\nBecause I was born to a \"broken\" mother, \\(she was schizophrenic and chose to self medicate with alcohol\\), who married a Vietnam veteran with PTSD who also self medicated with alcohol, I didn't learn to swim nor was I given a boat or a life raft.....I had to dog paddle, half drowning,  taking on gulps of water along the way.\n\nBy the time I was in my mid 30's, I was diagnosed for the first time as bipolar, suffering from PTSD from my childhood abuse and that stemming from my first marriage, and was self medicating with alcohol. By the time I was in my 40's,  I was diagnosed with epilepsy. I was a danger to myself: someone who refused to treat ANY of their physical or mental illnesses.\n\nI will not go into the destruction of my life for it is a common theme for folks who suffer from mental illness and alcoholism as a result of self medicating said mental illnesses.  190 days ago I stopped that barreling down the river towards the abyss and reached out for the shore.

It took a complete psychotic breakdown and though I have yet to hear from the court, I am facing 2 felonies and a DUI because I refused to face the fact that I was mentally ill JUST LIKE my mother......just like my dead brother.

I go to therapy every week for my PTSD and BiPolar/mood disorder  \\(I guess that was MANIA and not just that I liked to talk a lot and was full of enormous amounts of energy......and had a bad temper sometimes....especially when drunk.\\) I still fight the medications from the shrink...but when I am manic, \\(I am pretty sure this is what prompted the bad week that got me arrested that day. I didn't even have half my clothes on....didn't know where I was...don't remember a thing and my BAC wasn't that high.......\\) I have to take something or I start to spin out of control REALLY fast..... and I am back on my seizure medications. I am middle aged, so the medical stuff seems to never end...\n\nBUT I AM SOBER........\n\nI made it to the shore and am on dry land............I just have to learn how to walk now on water logged legs  :\\)",

   "selftext": "One of the most surprising parts of sobriety for me has been speaking to people on the phone with greater ease and frequency than before.\n\nWhen I was growing up in the '80s and '90s, phoning a friend was an essential part of my social life. I didn't need an excuse or reason; I just called. In high school, I'd talk for an hour or more with friends and girlfriends. This continued on into college, though with a bit less frequency as services like AIM and email became viable alternatives to phone communication. \n\nGradually, everyone got cell phones and dropped their landline service. Soon, my phone conversations were reduced to a minimum. I'd speak to my parents on the phone, but only after arranging a time in advance. When my parents called me without warning, my heart skipped a beat \u2014 I expected to hear that someone had died. On the rare occasions a friend would call me at random, it would annoy me. Couldn't they tell me what they wanted beforehand?\n\nAs my alcoholism deepened, avoiding phone calls became a convenient way to mask my addiction. Though I sent countless ill-advised emails and texts while drunk, I usually had the sense to avoid responding to messages until I'd sobered up the next day. Text messages and emails are, by definition, pre-meditated: I could edit what I wrote. If I typed something that didn't look good, I could delete it and start over. This wasn't possible in person or on the phone. Then it wasn't difficult to tell that I was loaded.\n\nI got sober and, some months later, found a sponsor in AA. He suggested that I do three things: meet him weekly to study the Big Book and work through the steps, attend 90 meetings in 90 days, and speak to three alcoholics in person or on the phone each day, excluding him. The first two suggestions I've readily adhered to. The third, though, has been much more difficult.\n\nI've been shy about exchanging numbers with other men at AA meetings, even though this is encouraged. When I do manage to get someone's number, I think about calling but often decide against it. Here's what goes through my head: He's going to think it's weird. He's going to be busy. There are going to be awkward pauses. The call will be abbreviated. Even though he says to call him anytime, he doesn't really mean it. It's an intrusion, after all. I'm interrupting him. And on and on.\n\nBut when I've worked up the courage to call someone, I've found that, almost without exception, he's been happy to hear from me. Sometimes he says he'll call me back, and he does. Often he has five, 10, or 15 minutes right then to chat. There are awkward pauses, but they aren't so bad. I often feel so much better after talking to him \u2014 as if it were a meeting in miniature.\n\nToday, I spoke to my sponsor about this subject \u2014 on the phone, natch. \"When you call someone you're helping him, too,\" he said. I hadn't thought of that \u2014 but it's true.\n\nI realize now that so much of my fear of speaking on the phone had little to do with the inefficiencies of the medium \u2014 but rather my lifelong shyness. One of the myths of sobriety is that it does away with your shortcomings; in fact, it reveals them for the world to see. I've always cared far too much about what other people have thought about me. My fear of calling people is just an expression of that. And it's something that I'm going to need more time to get used to. \n\nBut I'm going to try. And I'm going to not drink for the rest of today. ",

   "selftext": "TL;DR\nCant go more than 3 days without a binge night by myself. Is this problematic?\n\n\nI bet this kind of post is repeated daily but I need insight. I'm 21 years old male. So I've been drinking pretty regularly for the last couple of years. But only recently I have noticed I cant go more than around 3 days without having a binge night. I cant not drink for more than a week even if I tell myself that I wont. I dont think I get withdrawals or anything but after going for a few days straight without drinking, I find myself feeling 'deserving' of having a binge and go buy myself a bottle of wine or drink from my homebrew. Is this a warning sign that I should drastically limit my intake or am I a long way from hurting myself and others so I can keep drinking? I do my drinking mostly by myself mind you. ",

And since then i\u2019ve been terrified of drinking, to the point of ending relationships just because the girl drank socially.\n I\u2019ve never drank, and i\u2019m scared to become addicted to it. The worst part about it is that it limits my social interactions. With friends it\u2019s usually ok, I look over it and keep going. But when i\u2019m dating someone, and the person drinks, even with it being just casually, it starts making me extremely uncomfortable, and I honestly have no idea why that happens. I have no history of alcoholism in my family, no history of drugs so apparently no reason for me to be like that.\n I hate being like this, being pushed back just because of alcohol, having to lie that I stopped drinking just so I don\u2019t get peer pressured into drinking in parties, just because i want to fit in. I wish i was more open to it, and I really don\u2019t know what could have caused it and what I could do to change it. ",

My pattern for many years (decades) now has been: 1) drink one or two beers several nights a week when getting home from work 2) have one or two when out to eat or hanging out with friends 3) drink too much some time when around others who drink more or at a celebration - say and/or do something stupid or dangerous or hurtful - have a bad hangover the next day with the usual symptoms and also pretty strong anxiety 4) swear I will never drink again, make notes of the reasons why drinking is a bad idea for me 5) have no alcohol for weeks or even months 6) the sting wears off and I rationalize, saying I will just make sure I don't have more than 2 in one day or will only drink at home where I never have more than two 7) repeat (Note: I can be in steps #1 and #2 for months, drinking \"reasonably\")\n\nAnd today I am at #3, bad hangover part. Granted it's not a really bad hangover (I didn't have THAT much last night) but I'm thinking about some dumb things I said last night and how I really should not have driven home. I'm having an elevated level of anxiety and feeling ashamed and like I'm wasting another day of my life nursing a hangover. I'm also worried that one day I will not be so lucky and something very bad will happen due to drinking too much. \n\nWhat I'm wondering is how can I remember that I'm better off not drinking at all, that it eventually ends up with me having too much one day, even if it is only once a year or something like that? As I said, I've written down reasons why I should abstain but I don't seem to review them or take them seriously or even think of them when I decide to pick up some beer on the way home from work or when I say \"yes\" to a friends invitation to come over for whiskey and cigars.

It seems like a distant memory, but the disease does flicker once in a while -- that is why I go to meetings a few times a week *at least* and work with a sponsor regularly. In my experience, alcoholism is a mental illness of selfishness and self-deception; that is why I have to work with others to keep myself honest.\n\nMy life is much better than it used to be materially and psychologically. I have a better job, better relationships, and *far* better mental health. It's not perfect, though. I still have a very addictive personality; playing too many videogames, binging on netflix, eating a large pizza (when I shouldn't), or obsessing over work gossip are addictions that are still there. These are addictions with a lower case \"a\": They are minor and much, much easier problems to deal with than drugs and alcohol.\n\nThomas Jefferson said \"Eternal vigilance is the price of freedom\". I have found that to be the case for freedom from drinking. However, it is not as hard as you might think. Today's daily reflection was simple and quite apt:\n\n\"Above all, take it one day at a time.\"\nAS BILL SEES IT, p. 11\n\nThat's really all it takes. Really.\n",

I\u2019m going to meetings whenever I can, taking the meds daily (they work, I highly recommend anyone thinking about it to give it a shot), and therapy begins Wednesday. \n\nI have not yet made peace with my alcoholism, but I have acknowledged her. \n\nOriginally, it was unclear whether or not my partner of 2.75 years and I were going to stay together, but things are getting better with that and we\u2019re going to stay together; he\u2019s finally talking to me and looking me in the eyes again, holding my hand again and giving me affection. \n\nI thanked the teachers at my children\u2019s school who took my keys away when I arrived drunk to pick them up.

   "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nFirst I\u00b4ll tell you a little bit about myself. I\u00b4m 33 years old, work in IT, live in Spain, and yes, I am addicted to videogames.\n\nFor eight years (19-27) I struggled with alcoholism, spending every night at my parent\u00b4s home either playing or watching TV shows drunk. After that I move to another city, made new friends and get into my first relationship (which ended up being an abusive one, but that\u00b4s another story) and even I stopped drinking, I was getting more isolated every day. I didn\u00b4t trust anyone (my bf cheated on me several times, my friends didn\u00b4t support me, at work my boss and colleagues took advance of my \u201cniceness\u201d) and I was blaming all of them for my pain.\n\nOne year and a half ago my bf broke up with me, my friends from the new city stopped talking to me (and viceversa), being completely alone but for my friends back in my home city.\n\nAnd guess what, those friends are all gamers, so playing several hours a day with them while speaking in teamspeak become all my life. I had everything I need not to feel like crap.\n\nIn the last few months I set several goals to improve myself, and I didn\u00b4t last more than a week for any of those because the only thing I that I *really* wanted was coming home and play (with everything that comes with it like a lot of coke zero, carb based dinner and a lot of smoking).\nI kind of gave up on making any improvement, I just assumed that I\u00b4m that shitty and I should be content with what I have. Until two days ago, which by some random act, youtube took me to Game Quitters channel (thanks Cam Adair) and realized that I\u00b4ve been moving my problems for one addiction to another for years (Alcoholism --&gt; TV shows --&gt; Love Dependency --&gt; Buying stuff --&gt; Videogames) and every time I went to a therapist I solved the addiction without coming back to the root of the problem (self-love, care and taking action to get what I want in life).\n\nI\u00b4ve got a history of addictions, and while I don\u00b4t believe in \u201cAddictive personalities\u201d, in my case there is a pattern to avoid confronting my problems getting attached to addictive stuff. And because of that I know that I lack of self-control and moderation, therefore I need to cut off with gaming the hard way. That\u00b4s why I\u00b4m selling my PC (Instead I\u00b4ll buy a Surface, because I still need a PC for work), accounts and consoles.\n\nBut I\u00b4m scared as hell. Without a social net, having no hobbies and previous failures it\u00b4s going to be difficult. I\u00b4m not a social person and expert procrastinator and I fear the most being rejected. Anyway, I\u00b4ll do my best trying to get myself out of my own misery and I hope you guys will be supportive in the weeks to come and I would love to share the beginning of my new life with you.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read :)\n\n**UPDATE (04/06/2018)**\n\nWell, I sold my computer, with all the gaming accounts associated. Since then I have been numb, spending most of the time watching TV shows (which it should be the next thing to address I guess) and not going out. I know I should replace gaming with a lot of different activities to fulfill the void, but it is harder than I though. \n\nI have been really close to purchase a second hand Xbox a couple of times, and I still don\u00b4t know how I manage to stop it.\n\nIf there is any newcomers reading this let me give you a piece of advice. If you are going to quit videogames:\n\n- Sell all your hardware/accounts (or gift it to a friend/non-profit org) and put the money aside in a savings account or something like that (the idea is not being able to get the money if you have an instant regret and try to buy a console or PC).\n- Think about the possible points of failure that can make you come back to VG (explain the situation to your family/friends, unsubscribe from gaming channels on Youtube, etc).\n- The most important one: Plan, plan, plan. Make sure you have a new daily routine on paper so it\u00b4s easier to follow. If you don\u00b4t plan the most probably outcome will be substituting VG with something as unhealthy as them (this is what happened to me with TV Shows).\n- Check daily your source of unhappiness. After this days without playing I realized I am not happy at my current job, it is stressing me out and I am not learning/progressing in my career. \n\nLooking to the bright side, I decided to make an arrangement with my current employer to get out of my job getting paid and move out to another country, which will make me out of my confort zone and probably help to continue improving.\n\n\n",

I am in my 40s and last year my mother was diagnosed with cancer.

My husband would smoke a joint and I would drink 6 pack of wine coolers while sitting out back during the summer. Then I decided that the wine coolers weren't that high in alcohol content and just sugar! So I switched to a bottle of red wine. Then I started drinking earlier on Saturdays, my drinking time became 4PM instead of 8 or nine, and because of that I needed 2 bottles of wine. Now I find myself wanting it all the time and 4 pm is now 3 pm. And today is the first time I'm drinking on a work night! Tomorrow is a big event at work and I've been on vacation all week. I've been letting loose every other day. And here I am polishing off a bottle and a half of wine, my reasoning is, it's still earlier, I can feel fine in the morning. I think overall it has to do with the sugars and not just the alcohol... but still. I want to add... I've never felt guilty about drinking. I have always been able to do whatever I needed to the next day. I don't cancel plans. I know in my mind what an alcoholic is...\n\nBut I still wonder... am I becoming one?",

   "selftext": "Thank you all for being here - it\u2019s really helpful to have a safe place to be able to shout from the mountain top - I\u2019VE MADE IT 10 DAYS!!! (And want to make it thousands more)\n\nFunny how after years of first being in denial then hiding my alcoholism (perhaps not all that successfully) from my friends and family I now feel like I can\u2019t talk to them about my recovery either.  With friends - several of whom drink - I sense telling them openly that I\u2019ve quit will come with judgement and distance (as they assume I\u2019ll judge them).  With family - even my husband and kids - I expect skepticism that I\u2019ve actually quit.  I said something dumb to my 14 year old son last night and I could almost see him crane his neck to see if I had a wine glass next to me.  So this journey is for me - and I will be judged by myself and right now it feels so good to be on the right track!\n\nMy story is (I think) not too uncommon, other than that I started drinking later than most.  Didn\u2019t drink at all in HS, I fact only drank 2X ever before I turned 21 in my senior year at college.  Then it was super casual - maybe once or twice a month.  Then I made a friend in my mid 20\u2019s, she became my drinking buddy and we and our husbands would meet up to play cards and drink.  Later I became friends with a neighbor who\u2019s graceful hospitality never let my wine glass be empty.  Occasional drinking became daily drinking.  Then I started the routine of quitting periodically to prove I could - nope, I don\u2019t have a problem.  Eventually, I even started calling myself an alcoholic to some people but wore it like a badge rather than a confession and just kept on drinking.  Sometime last year I noticed myself starting to hide the extent of my habit - sneaking empty bottles outside to recycling when no one was looking.  Drinking wine from an opaque coffee mug... yep I had a problem so I decided to cut back, and failed over and over again.  11 days ago was the first time in my life I\u2019ve blacked out - and that was the watershed moment for me.  Lots of embarrassing evidence of my drunkenness around my house that NO ONE has brought up.  That\u2019s when I decided this wasn\u2019t about cutting back - I was done.  I am doing this for myself and for my kids, but I am doing it invisibly - some day I\u2019ll open up about my struggle and my shame with the kids so they have a chance to not repeat my downslide and struggle to be healthy.  \n\nThanks so much for being out there, for listening and helping give me strength!  \n\nIWNDWYT",

I'm not drinking every day, but more often than not (I'd say 3-5 days per week on average, over the last few months). \n\nI want off the ride. Now, I don't think the \"no drinking\" part will be hard, but I'm afraid of the side effects it can bring. I've done CT before, but I haven't been wise enough to look up the side effects.

Maybe some encouragement perhaps idk.\n\n\nEDIT: 48h and counting! Been a bit rough, but I manage. I was about to fall off the wagon yesterday when I read about kindling further down.

However, I couldn't bring myself to open the bottles, so I didn't. Pulse is still normal, looking around is still a bit different (due to not being off the influence for awhile. Similar to when I've tried to stop nicotine) but nothing out of the ordinary. My excessive sweating seems to have stopped, I fell asleep a bit later than usual but could sleep just fine, and my stomach seems to be returning to normal. All in all, can't complain!",

   "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nI have been lurking in this community for a few years now but have never really contributed outside of upvoting posts. I am writing this mostly for myself to document my feelings and journey, however I thought I would post it here. It is longer than I thought it would be, and I've omitted quite a bit. Here is my personal voyage through the mires of alcohol addiction.\n\nMy own personal journey with alcohol started about 10 years ago when I turned 19, legal age in my country. Before this, I had drank a bit at parties and whatnot but it was very minimal and almost not worth mentioning. My initial escapades getting to know the drink were a bit back and forth. I never saw it as a crutch I could lean on until after I went through a bad breakup in my early 20s. I started drinking more and more out of sheer loneliness and heartbreak and it snowballed from there without me realising just what I was doing and what was happening. It made me feel better (or so I thought at the time) when I needed something, anything to get me through it. This heartbreak did not last a few weeks or a few months, but years. \n\nThe next several years are a giant blur that mesh together to form some incoherent past. Chronologically my memories are scrambled and I sometimes have a difficult time piecing together the timeframe in which events happened. Day in and day out drinking, getting stoned and being a complete burnout with no aspirations or ambitions to better myself. Despite my earlier years of being a very outgoing, happy person - this person I had become was a complete contrast to who everyone around me knew me as growing up, particularly my family.\nIt was about 3 years after the breakup that started all this and the pain of it still clung to me like barnacles to a ships hull. I was unable to come to terms with it and accept it because I drowned my sorrows in a bottle every night rather than dealing with it directly. I had dated others during this time, but they were fleeting relationships that I probably shouldn't have been in in the first place, marred by my alcohol consumption and general lack of love for myself. During this time and mostly thanks to my parents who pushed me and supported me to get better, I managed to enrol in college and get a degree.\n\nThrough all of college I was still a drunken burnout but I graduated and came out with skills that I could actually apply to the real world and got a good job right out of the gate. After graduating was when I started to really look at myself and notice that something was wrong. I decided to quit smoking but I just could not give up the drink.\n\nI moved out of my familys house and into an apartment with a good friend. This transition was huge for me and I had big plans to moderate my drinking and aspire to become a person I could love. Long story short, that didn't happen. Within weeks I was drinking half a quart or more of rum a night and hiding bottles everywhere. Being very embarrassed about this addiction, I hoarded the empty bottles in my closet and hid them from view of anyone. Why I didn't just take the emptys and dump them in the recycle downstairs I don't know.. I had plans to, but the more I drank, the more the bottles accumulated and the more embarrassed I would be taking 24 dozen cases of beer down the stairs, the clang of shame. What I did not know at the time was after a while the empty bottles of beer and rum started to emit a smell that was noticeable as soon as you entered the unit. I could not tell as I was around it all the time. I only learned this after we had moved out and my roommate told me. I still feel bad about it to this day.\n\nI moved out on my own and am currently living alone. Once again I had big plans to curb my drinking and work on my sobriety. By this point I had tried 4 or 5 times to get sober but after a few days or weeks I fell right back off the wagon. I was reaching out for help but it was just not working, I had not yet reached my rock bottom..\n\nFast forward a bit, living alone, aspirations to cut back dashed again, drinking in full swing. Hiding bottles, not wanting to carry cases of beer and full bags of empty rum bottles downstairs to the recycle for fear of other tenants seeing me and judging me. I started seeing someone who I really fell for and would make my heart skip when they were around. Someone who had not made me feel like this since the relationship that I described earlier. Things were going great, then they fell apart, not without the help of my old 'friend' alcohol. 'Not again' I thought..\n\nThis all sent me into an even deeper spiral of depression and drinking that I could not get out of alone. I vividly remember my last night of drinking. Feeling lonely and depressed, I was polishing off a bottle of rum at 3am and stumbled into a pile of boxes, falling on my ass. 'What the hell am I doing'.. 'what is happening to me'.. I blamed my alcoholism for another failed opportunity at a happy life. These thoughts were running through my head and at that moment something clicked... Something that I can't explain fully, I don't know exactly what it was, some kind of voice that was in my head that had been drowned from years of drinking telling me to get up and fix myself before I end up worse than I already am.\n\nI woke up the next day, signed into this site and requested my badge. This is I believe my 6th or 7th attempt to be sober, but something feels different now. There is a fire in me that refuses to go back to those days. Today, this is the longest time I've been sober in 10 years and I have no intention of letting that go. Gutting my place of empty bottles and cans felt incredible, like I was throwing away my old self and beginning fresh. That person may be gone, but the memories will remain as a reminder of where I came from.\n\nI am now sleeping much better, eating better, have an exercise regime that I enjoy doing. I am performing much better at my job. I've lost at least 10 pounds and my face and skin are much clearer. I still have a long way to go to find myself once again, but every day that I don't drink is a victory. \n\nThank you SD for giving me an outlet to help me realise that I am not alone in my journey, and inspiration to continue on this path. It's not without hard work, I've learned stopping drinking isn't some magical thing that will suddenly make all aspects of life better instantly. It takes time and effort, and I still have my down days but I'm learning to cope with them in a healthy way.",

Alcoholism runs in my family hard and heavy and I knew it was going to ruin my life from the first sip of Jag that I stole from my mom's stash. Access to alcohol is incredibly easy for me as all of my friends are over 19, including my boyfriend. Some of them know I have a problem, some don't, but I typically have no problem picking up a few bottles a week or stealing booze from my parents. My childhood was all around traumatic, I suffered mental and physical abuse from my father, my mother was rarely around as she worked two jobs, and I was mostly responsible for raising my siblings. I was bullied in elementary and high school, have terrible self esteem, and was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder in grade 10. I have sever anger issues that mostly surface when I'm intoxicated. I was raped because of drinking, I lost a baby because of drinking. Alcohol cost me my first relationship after she got tired of me stumbling into our bed every night after being out with my drinking friends, usually wasted and agitated and looking for a fight. I eventually broke up with her because she didn't support my \"party lifestyle\" as I called it and because she was always untrusting and suspicious of me, and losing her almost killed me in the long run. When I'm sober I'm intelligent, creative, driven, and, above all, kind. I used to be that hippie-dippie tree lover girl that would never harm a fly and cared about the environment more than myself, but my drunken alter ego starts fights, punches walls and vehicles, litters, and starts fires. I hate who I become when I drink, yet every evening around 6/7 if not earlier I reach for my rum. I drink until I pass out and absolutely cannot stop myself after one drink, or two, or even half a bottle when I know I'm too drunk but I just don't care. I spend all day hungover in bed, sometimes dragging myself to work or sometimes calling in. My hours have been cut lately because I show up every day with a \"migraine\" and can't do much work or I call in sick leaving them scrambling to find a replacement. I used to be fantastic at my job, almost at a management position, respected by my coworkers, now I'm an annoyance. My grades in school were mediocre but I know I could've done so much better if I hadn't showed up to school drunk or hungover or usually not at all. Now I'm out of high school but not yet in college and feeling completely hopeless, lost, and useless... but not for long. This is day one. Last night I ignored the bottle that was calling my name, smoked a little weed, and went to bed at midnight. I've made it a day or two before, 8 days being my longest, but this time I know I have to do this for myself, my relationship, my friends, and my future. I need to better myself. I'm tired of being the drinker of the group, casually being referred to as an alcoholic, of feeling guilty every morning. So, cheers to day one I suppose. I will not drink with you today.",

   "selftext": "That pretty much says it. I drank about 13 years a lot of the week but not every day. For the past 6 up until I I quit I drank anywhere from 12\\-18 beers daily usually spread over the whole day. My only break was for 5 days years ago when I ran out of money temporarily. \n\nI simply got tired of it and went in to detox for a couple days. It kept interrupting my sleep, I was bruising way too easy, getting sick and \\(maybe from lack of sleep\\) starting to hallucinate. I have seizures now and then naturally \\(why I started drinking so much I suppose\\) so detox was my only option because trying to quit would just send me to the hospital anyway.\n\nI'm very happy I made that choice.\n\nAt the hospital they performed some tests and my liver enzymes and stuff were out of whack. My sugar was rather high which was unusual and has gone away.\n\nHonestly I'm not sure what's normal. I'm not even sure exactly where my liver stands because I'm seeing a new doctor and their patient portal doesn't show exact results for all tests.\n\nI know some things are just a little off but my blood cells are large and my protein levels simply show \"\\&gt;300\" which I know is rather high. I can't see results for any of the enzymes.\n\nI've no yellowing but I form random bruises without being bumped. I also bruise very easily now whereas before you could whack my full force and I just wasn't the type to bruise. Some days I wake up and all I can do is puke everywhere if I try to consume even water.\n\nI obviously haven't completely killed my liver yet but I'm not sure I'd be able to say that if I kept on much longer.\n\nI don't intend to drink again. It's not like other drugs I've quit in the past where I'm sitting there wishing for it after. I simply got tired of it. Seeing it turns my stomach, I want nothing to do with it. Thinking about how much time I've wasted almost makes me sick to my stomach but you can't change what's done.\n\nI know the liver can heal itself if it hasn't gone too far. I'm really not sure what I'm looking for here. I guess someone that was in a similar situation. Maybe someone with similar side effects from drinking too much. I'm hoping it goes away and everything returns to normal.\n\nThis can be a very hard thing to get away from once you get attached. I am healing here but can't remember the last time I felt this good. It's worth quitting if you are stuck on it. It might not seem like it but I know I'm never going back.\n\nBest of luck to all of you. ",

   "selftext": "So I\u2019m a 17 year old girl and I am kind of living as a camper rn so I study at an Internet cafe. \n\nThere\u2019s this older man who is almost always there, the first whom introduced himself to me. He\u2019s always talking about himself and basically gave me his life story about immigrating from New Zealand,lost his green card, ID got stolen, quitting drinking and struggles with alcoholism, being my age in the 70s, etc. I\u2019m not familiar with what the New Zealand accent sounds like except from movies but he sounds Canadian or American to me, and I\u2019d figure they\u2019d sound more like Aussies. He\u2019s also very white looking, which I thought New Zealand was more Maori/Maori mixed descent. But I know there\u2019s white people there too, so that\u2019s not a very important observation. \n\nI try to be polite but I need to study. He keeps commenting on how I look like Judy garland (I\u2019m biracial and I don\u2019t), how I\u2019m beautiful, look like an actress, and should get into modeling. Keeps saying \u201cvery attractive\u201d. \n\nThe next few days he\u2019s still there, and told me I\u2019d look very attractive as a blond and should dye my hair blond and that my mother would freak out because she dyes hers blond. He also says he finds my mother attractive as well and that \u201cmy mom didn\u2019t look like that\u201d. \n\nHe kept talking about his 62nd Birthday so I wished him a happy birthday and didn\u2019t want to get into an extended convo. \n\nHe wouldn\u2019t stop commenting on my looks, how I\u2019m \u201cvery attractive\u201d, my hair (he noticed a minor trim), every single outfit I wear, and he asked if I was 16 because he said I looked 16. I told him I was 17.  This creeped me out because of him saying both that I was very attractive and trying to flirt in a not so subtle way and the fact that he\u2019s 4 times my age. \n\nThen apparently my mom told me he said that he wanted to give me personal guitar lessons to make me a star and could make me famous. And that he should have personal time with me. \n\nI try not to speak much except a simple hello and a slight smile not to come off as a total bitch. \n\nSo.....after I go to the web cafe, I keep seeing him around town, and around the places I shower or go to eat or etc. The same places I go and there\u2019s a lot of them. The places I go are fairly quiet. I start going to Starbucks instead but depending on what we\u2019re doing the Internet cafe is often more convenient. \n\nI\u2019m a bit creeped out. Advice? Do I have a right to be irked or am I just being a special snowflake? \n",

I know I shouldn't be nervous about the interview because it's a temp job that I could do in my sleep, I have years of experience working in organized and hectic office environments. I'm qualified for the job 10x over but I'm still anxious as FUCK about the interview! I haven't had one in half a year! I'm nervous about the inevitable questions about my gap in employment... and even more nervous about them possibly calling my last employer. While I was never drunk on the job, my attendance was less than stellar and they all knew that I was an alcoholic. I mean I never said it but my supervisor had been a drunk for like 15 years before she cleaned up her act and she knows exactly what active alcoholism looks like... so I'm scared of what they might say to my potential new employer. \n\n\nBut fuck it, I am a week sober, I am being productive every day in some way, I'm walking more and actually putting in efforts towards my appearance. Straightening my hair, wearing make up, dressing in clothes other than yoga pants and my ex's old tshirts, washing/moisturizing my face every night, showering every other day (when I was drunk and depressed I'd shower like once a week.... \ud83e\udd22) I'm in a really good place right now and I'm also joining a gym on Thursday!

   "selftext": "I just have to get some things off my chest, I am feeling very confused and stressed. Last night had a 3 hour phone conversation with my ex boyfriend, we broached the subject of getting back together. We\u2019ve only been together for about 10 months, it was a very good experience up until about a month ago, and I love him so much, I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this before, and we have such an amazing connection. His drinking does bother me, I hate to see him killing himself, and I don\u2019t like the person he becomes the more he\u2019s had to drink. Some background, both of my parents were alcoholics, my dad, the lonely depressed angry belligerent, and my mom, the life of the party, happy go lucky gal who wanted to be friends with everyone (yet ignored me growing up). I definitely have many issues of my own related to alcoholism and how I handle myself in order to cope with it and what it does to my emotions and the person it turns me into. I know that I am codependent in relationships. The last month or so though has been filled with conflict and emotional pain. He broke up with me, because he said I was not being truthful with him about how much his drinking bothered me. I was slightly dumbfounded because I didn\u2019t know I was supposed to say something, I just kept quiet, I didn\u2019t realize how much I had been suppressing my feelings, it was as if I just went on autopilot in terms of expressing (not expressing) my feelings any time it had to do with alcohol or drinking or the problems it creates or the way it makes me feel (so much conflict growing up and so much anger tied into drinking for me, so in a way I shut down). In many ways he was right about what I was doing, and I am glad that he pointed that out to me and is actually open to having a dialogue about it. We ended up getting back together a week later only to break up again 2 weeks after that (he ended it again over what I believe was a complete misunderstanding). I was so angry at him during these break ups (technically we are still broken up). I told him I never wanted to be in an on again off again relationship, yet here I am it seems. I avoided talking with him, and wanted to move on without him, he broke it off so I figured he doesn\u2019t want me in his life, so I don\u2019t want to be with someone who doesn\u2019t want to be with me and I started thinking at that point maybe I don\u2019t want to be with a person who drinks so much, maybe this isn\u2019t healthy for me. It\u2019s been about 2 weeks, and he had been calling me and texting me, I tried to ignore most of it. We emailed each other to try to get some closure with things and he still wanted to call me and talk to me, I told him I didn\u2019t see the point, yet I finally answered his phone call. We talked for over 3 hours and I feel like I was able to get a lot of things off my chest and that he actually listened. I realized just how hard it is for me to open up about these topics and he seemed to genuinely care about what I had to say and wanting to try to understand. He made a casual mention of quitting drinking and I told him I needed space and that I and was very hurt. I can understand where he is coming from as far as the issues he had with my lack of communication and our miscommunication but I told him that when you\u2019re in a relationship with someone you can\u2019t just end things like that so abruptly and then want to talk about it after the fact, after the damage and hurt have been done. He said he wants to work on having a healthy and productive relationship with me and that if it takes phone calls for months until we see each other again he is willing to do that. I told him I\u2019m just not sure, that I\u2019m afraid to get hurt again, if I say something that he misunderstands instead of talking to me, is he just going to break up with me. What kind of self respecting person goes back after being dumped twice? He said that he was wrong in the manner in which he handled things and that talking about things is what people in relationships do, I understand they take work, but this has had me all torn up since it started back in April. I want to have a conversation about the possibility of him actually quitting drinking, but I feel like that is a pipe dream and setting myself up for more hurt. That codependent side of me is looking for ways I can help him, there has to be a way, and then the other side of me is saying, whoa, slow down, you\u2019re not even together right now, and this might be a really bad idea. I love him so much and I know he loves me, but it also seems that sometimes love is not enough. I think about things I\u2019ve read that say an alcoholic can\u2019t recover if they are in a relationship then I\u2019ve heard stories of people saying that they recovered with the help of their friends and family, and when you care about someone you help them. He may not even really want to stop drinking, he has brought it up a few times, but then has said other things like he will never quit, I can only imagine how difficult it must be, but people do it. I know that he has to do it for himself, and not for me or our relationship, but these things all seemed very intertwined. Lately since the break up I\u2019ve been trying to focus on myself, my physical and mental health and well being, doing things with friends to keep my mind off of things, and of course all of my friends don\u2019t see why this is eating me up inside, they just tell me to block his number and never talk to him again, why would I want to be with someone who drinks that much, and why would I ever take someone back who has broken my heart twice in 3 weeks. I feel like I\u2019m going to alienate my friends and I am so torn on what I should do. I can\u2019t imagine not talking to him again ever, and I\u2019m not ready to make a decision on our relationship status just yet, I know I don\u2019t have to decide right now, but just talking to him last night brought back all those old feelings (that had never really gone away). By the end of the conversation we were even laughing and joking around and sharing about what was going on with our lives. My walls came back down and I just wanted to be with him again, but I have tread very cautiously here. Like I said, just needed to get this out. ",

Was scared and never went to do it. Changed doc and had many tests done at which I also started mentioning my depression and anxiety and we both came to an agreement that maybe the cause of my nausea/vomiting was due to anxiety. Doc put me on Zoloft and Xanax \\(about 8 months ago\\) and now it only happens on rare occasions, much less frequent than before. I've stopped taken Zoloft for a few weeks two times and started getting sick again so fairly certain it is anxiety related. Benzo tolerance came on quick. Within 2 months I went up from .25mg to 2mg a day. Although I was abusing them taking anywhere from 2mg \\- 8mg a day. After 2 months I quit Xanax cold turkey. I also quit drinking shortly after, as I would drink 3 \\- 10 beers a night for the last 8 months roughly. Often mixing benzos and alcohol causing black out. I was also dealing with my wife having an affair at the time which made my depression and anxiety much worse causing me to self harm a few times.\n\nSorry for the lengthy history. Currently writing this at work while trying to distract myself from having a panic attack. Now that you know my background. The big question, and maybe this is the wrong sub for this but I figured it's worth a shot.\n\nI consider myself a perfectionist with all things, not saying I'm great at all things but I always try my best, if I'm not trying my absolute best then I'm not in a good mood. Our marriage counselor recently mentioned perfectionism goes hand in hand with anxiety. I haven't mentioned to our counselor that I have been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety, and panic disorder. It was just a follow up statement he mentioned after he asked me if I consider myself a perfectionist and I said yes. Not sure if there is any medical data to ACTUALLY back this, but assuming he is correct. It made me think.\n\nDepression, anxiety, addiction, alcoholism, marijuana dependance, shopping addiction, OCD. All of which I believe are some sort of mental illness, weather it be an actual disorder or a self control issue. Maybe this is just me over thinking things but could all these issues some how be related? Maybe I should have gotten the brain scan. Any change there is maybe something actually wrong with me physically?\n\nIf this is the wrong sub is there a correct sub to ask this?",

In a relatively brief period, my heavy alcohol dependency has:\n-destroyed friendships and relationships \n-made me into a stealing, dishonest, manipulative person \n-led me to making risky decisions that could\u2019ve resulted in STDs or pregnancy \n-put me in a vulnerable position that led to a bad sexual assault \n-exacerbated my suicidal tendencies and depression\n-induced hospital visits \n-shown me lab results with signs of early liver problems \n-put me on a dangerous and predictable path that would\u2019ve fulfilled my family\u2019s alcoholism prophecy \n-almost caused me to fail out of school\n\nBut\u2014 three months ago, after waking up yet again in a puke-filled haze at a random frat house, worried about being pregnant or having been assaulted again, and considering slicing my wrists with the broken bottle by my feet\u2014 I decided that enough was enough.

So much relief. So much hope. So much pride. I struggle so much still, and I can\u2019t be left alone in a room with alcohol, but I have better, supportive friends that keep me accountable when I get bad cravings. The first two weeks were hell, but now I get to see Sunday mornings without feeling like human garbage. I get to flip off the drunks in my family.

Got everything we wanted, not in a spoiled way, but we were privileged. To make a long story short, I grew up used to my parents drinking and some nights, it going to far. I remember my mom falling down the stairs once. My dad always, always, ends up partying by himself and playing music super loud all night.\n\nIt sounds so tame, he was never violent at least that I saw, and his verbal insults were pretty mild compared to most \\(though frequent\\) besides to my mom. I'm strong willed and get upset and I would spend many nights trying to hide his speakers, only for him to tell me that I didn't deserve anything, I'm so horrible, yada yada.\n\nReally parsing details but: I found out his father is an alcoholic. He was bad through my dad's childhood and doesn't drink anymore and has never since I was alive. My brother is bipolar, he doesn't drink. I think in part due tohis diagnosis but also because I believe he saw or decided he was alcoholic as well. He lives in India and his wife doesn't drink so there's a lot of factors \\(my family is from US and we're 100&amp;#37; American\\)\n\nMy parents moved to Europe when I was 17 and graduated HS \\(it's not what you think, I'm independent, my dad sold his companies and I wanted to move out to go to my college town before starting freshman year and they supported me\\). I don't see them much anymore just because of the distance but I do see them about 3 months total out of the year with visiting each other. However, the culture here has daily alcohol consumption starting at lunch. For most, that's where it ends, besides some wine with dinner. My mom smokes too and since coming here from the states, is smoking I don't know how many more, but a lot.\n\nI am here now visiting and things are much worse. He's gotten extremely, extremely drunk twice in the last three days. When I was younger it was once every month, sometimes a lot longer sometimes not. He's hurling curses at me and my boyfriend \\(which is so, so embarrassing and tough for us all\\), verbally attacking my mom, and yelling at us. Telling us we're not fun, telling us he's not doing anything wrong. just because we asked him to turn the music down. The first time this week, he was at the bar with my bf and my bf's father who was visiting us. To skip a lot of details, my dad kept them out late and he lied to my mom and to me. He told my bf and father that I was lying for attention. This is really hurtful because my boyfriend and I are really, really serious and his family is so amazing and I was so nervous for them to meet. I knew it would happen. I got upset, I love my family and my dad's really hard on my mom. I told her she didn't deserve this. She told me it was normal for a man to do this, all she could do was wait and accept his morning apology. My dad is sexist and plays anything off on the fact that we're women. But pleaase, let it be known, I love him and my family more than anything. It's not every night, I live on my own almost entirely sustained on my bf's and my's own \\(will be 100&amp;#37; in a few months\\) and he's given me such a great life. When he's sober, he's amazing, so amazing.\n\nTonight though, it hit me, hard. We had a boozy lunch which was a mistake.. it's a weekly tradition with all of his new friends. They seem to party too, but they stopped at lunch. He wanted to \"go into town\" which I knew meant keep drinking. I know the warning signs and knew that was a recipe for disaster. So I said no, let's go home. So we did and he said he had to walk his dog. He didn't come home for three hours, hammered. From 2 pm until 1 am he was playing music and getting progressively... my brother calls it emotional. he's happy but he's quick to change. Don't tell him what to do or he'll get very sensitive and upset and hurt. It's so sad. It's so fucking sad. I can't stop crying. He's such a smart man and he's killing himself. I went to go yell at him to please turn it down and I looked through the glass pane of the kitchen and he's dancing to his music and there was... no emotion on his face. There was nothing behind his eyes. It was just the drink. I can't do it. Please help me. I don't know how to help him. My mom. She came out and grabbed me because I just lost it when I looked into his eyes. I saw the man I looked up to my entire life, my dad. I'm just his baby girl, and I want to help him. My mom grabbed me and brought me to her room and held me. I told her what I saw.\n\nMy mom is so stoic, she drinks a lot too but I know it's to cope with him. I don't think she has a problem. She doesn't drink when she's happy. I guess that means she has a problem. I'm sorry I'm so over the place, I've never let go like this. My mom never cries, is tough on me and as stubborn as anything. She looked at me tonight and said that she's going to leave him. Fuck. They're college sweethearts, my dad is going to be crushed. But she can't let this be her norm and she's right. She deserves to be happy. I'm so scared, I'm afraid my dad won't get the help. I want her to leave him a little too though. I told her to come live with me in the US and I think she may. I'm worried what my dad will do. I think he has some mental problems, something. He's so sensitive, I'm afraid he'll kill himself honestly.\n\nPlease help me. Please. I don't knpw how to help my family. I don't know how I can make my dad admit his problem is real and it breaks my heart to think that this man, this amazing man, is going to wake up tomorrow like he always does and feel so fucking guilty about the way he acted tonight. He cares so much about what people think about him \\(while simultaneously being very egotistical, borderline narcissistic\\). I know he feels inadequate right now because we were with my bf's family this week and my boyfriend's father is very, very wealthy and my dad always has to compare himself to others. I know he wishes he could have been more successful for me.\n\nMy brother and mother want him to go to India for a few months to detox the way my brother did. My worry is that, if he even does it, when he comes back here, the lfiestyle they lvie with their friends is not conducive to being clean. My mom says that one of their friends only has one glass of wine but i know that the answer is none for him. I'm scared because it was my brother's choice.\n\nI'm just so scared that he's going to die. I'm afriad he's killing my mom with him. I want to be able to be around him without wishing I could run away. I feel so guilty. I just want to help. I don't know how, he's so fragile and sensitive and I leave for the US soon. My mom would never tell me anything, like I said, she's stubborn and stoic. Any advice, please.",

At the beginning I was drinking heavily 2 days per week (10 drinks), and by the end I was drinking 5 days per week and blacking out 1-2 of those days (usually 12-14 drinks for me). Last wednesday I had one of those blackouts, and decided to get this under control. I had about 2-3 drinks Saturday and ever since then I haven\u2019t had a drink, so it\u2019s been about 75 hours since then. \n\nMy symptoms have been moderate shaking, high blood pressure, sweating, fever, and mild tremors. Does 4 months of heavy drinking constitute something I should seek immediate attention or since I\u2019m 75 hours in should I just tough out another day or two? Everything online about DTs and seizures are kind of freaking me out.\n\nEdit: Also, as mentioned I drank 5 days a week, but the other 2 days I didn\u2019t experience any withdrawal, but now that I stopped for good I have. Is this just mental or is that something that can happen?",

   "selftext": "I am amazed at myself for staying sober. I never thought I could do this, had tried so many times and failed that I didn\u2019t trust myself. It felt so daunting and scary to stop drinking. I had realized that I used alcohol as an escape, never facing my fears and emotions, much rather getting drunk. Whenever something happened that didn\u2019t feel good I would drink. I knew this had to stop. I could see that If I kept at it I would slowly ruin my health, my relationships, my business, my looks, everything. I knew it was time, but I felt so scared. But this time it felt different, this time I meant it and promised myself I would do whatever I had to to get and stay sober. It meant reading books about alcoholism, visualizing and affirming, it meant countless hours of meditations and \u201astop addiction\u2018 self hypnosis (on YouTube, I loooooooooved it) and writing my sobriety journal every day. The main difference this time was that I was finally ready to stop running away from my fears and emotions. Instead I faced them mindfully. Really sat with them, felt into them, let them flow through me and finally run out of stream. In the beginning it was such an overwhelming and scary business to face all these emotions that I had pushed down and numbed for so long. But day by day it felt better, and one day I realized that I actually enjoy all those emotions, even the so called bad ones. Feeling them meant I was actually alive and growing up. Doing all this work made me feel so proud of myself, a great change to the self-loathing I had become so used to. The added energy and clear headedness is a huge bonus also. \nIt wasn\u2019t easy and I really struggled a lot in the beginning. But with every craving I overcame, it got a little easier. And the cravings got less and less, which kind of surprised me. And no, my life is not all roses and rainbows, in fact it still sucks on a regular basis. BUT it would suck so much more with a hangover and the constant self-hate. And taking it one day, one hour, one minute at a time has proved to be a great tactic to face even the worst days. \nSo, a huge thanks to all of you, I really appreciate this place of understanding and cheering on. And I will not drink with you today. ",

   "selftext": " For those who do not know Alanon is the \u201csister\u201d program to AA for family and friends of alcoholics.  It uses the same twelve steps, but the focus there is of taking care of yourself, learning how to set boundaries, and not accepting the blame the alcoholic often wants to heap on you.   \n \n\nFor some reason I don't quite understand at their yearly anniversary meetings they invite an AA speaker in.  I've done this a few times over the years, and it's tricky. This is not the place to tell war stories, to 'qualify'. Instead, as I see it \u2013 it's a place for sharing my experience, strength, and hope \u2013 and last night, the commonalities many of us share. \n\n  \n  I spoke of powerlessness \u2013 that at one point I was incapable of keeping the promises I made to myself that I would not drink that day.  Or the promise that I would 'take it easy'.  I drank. I got drunk.   No matter how sincere I had been.  I spoke of having elastic lines \u2013 so I did not have to cross them.   I mentioned advanced degrees in rationalization.  \n  \n\nThen I switched to the real powerlessness \u2013 over everything else.  People in particular, wife, kids, boss, the guy who is trying to merge, the customer with an attitude.  I could not change them.  Sure I can ram my fender into the guy who is trying to get in front of me, but that's a lesson learned pretty quickly as we both watch traffic pass and argue on the side of the road..   \n \n\n A quick note: This was not totally foreign to me. I have enough alcoholism in my family to 'qualify' for Alanon \\(many of us do\\) and have attended these meetings on and off over the years.  There is a great deal I have learned from them. In particular: **That I can start my day over at any time.  That somebody's opinion of me is none of my business. That renting space in my head to someone does neither of us any good.**     \n \n\n I kept it short, I kept it upbeat \\(and they did not laugh nearly as easily as an AA room would have\\).  My main point was that the only thing I can change in any situation is my attitude.  Then, after about ten minutes I ended.   \n  \n\nI was followed by two Alanon speakers \u2013 and was reminded of just how much damage we can do with our drinking/drugging.  They spoke of 'waiting for THE phone call' they described the heartbreak of watching children destroy their own lives \u2013 and the emotional wreckage spreading to parents and beyond.  They spoke of love being chipped at and eroded by anger \u2013 and having to let go and watch the child they love follow a dangerous dark path.  None of the speakers last night described having to at the age of 60 step in and raise grandchildren that were being neglected or worse by addict parents \u2013 but there were a couple of them in the room... And they spoke of how the program had helped them come to grips with the problem, that they were no longer so alone.  \n  \n\nEarly on in my speaking I said that as a part of the problem \u201cmy middle name is DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO\u201d  That resonated,  These people knew that one.   \n  \n\nIn many ways I said, **recovery is learning how to become teachable. Simply learning how to listen.**  \n    \n  ",

   "selftext": "Hey guys.\n\nJust a bit of background on me first. I'm a 25 yo male from the UK. The last couple of months I've started to think I may have a problem with alcohol and would appreciate some input.\n\nTo begin, I rarely crave alcohol. I can go weeks without a drop and it doesn't bother me. I am fine going for a couple of drinks; a pint or two at the pub and I'm ok. I've even been on boozy dates where I've had a maybe 3/4 and I can handle that fine.\n\nThe problem seems to be when I go on a 'proper' night out, i.e. when I go out with intention of bar-hopping / clubbing. 5 pints seems to be the point of no return; after that I just want to drink and drink and drink. I start to feel the buzz and want more and more. This has, unfortunately, led to many hazy nights and often black outs over the years. \n\nI resent the embarrassment the following morning when a friend says to me \"Do you remember doing X last night?!\" Nope, can't say I do! I've thankfully (not yet) done anything completely outrageous or lost friends as a result of my drinking, but I have been obnoxious in the past. This has resulted in me being thrown out of bars/clubs on a few occasions.\n\nI enjoy drinking, and I like the feeling of being drunk (but not black out drunk!) and don't want to cut alcohol out of my life. However, I have two questions to ask:\n\n1. Based on what I have said, do you think I have some sort of problem with alcohol?\n\n2. Is there anything I can do to stop myself from buying \"just one more drink\"?\n\nSorry for my rambling. I appreciate any advice / thoughts you can share with me. :) ",

I spoke to a Sponsor who suggested going to at least 6\\-10 meetings, listening to everyone's shares, and then when I find someone I relate to, ask them to be my sponsor. She also said NA and AA 12 steps are different approaches, so to decide which one I want to be sponsored by. I'm not sure about either, so I'm going to go to some more NA and AA meetings, and I think i'm going to leave it down to finding the right person, then if they agree to sponsor me\u00a0I'll follow whatever programme they are doing.\n\nThe sponsor said to me tonight, \"Just keep coming back, I LOVE recovery, life just\u00a0gets better and better\" It made me so determined to continue this!

   "selftext": "Sorry this is so long. I can't talk to anyone about this, just needed to get it out.\n\nMy [~21yo] brother is addicted to alcohol and weed--not bud, either, but concentrates. When I visited this Christmas, I couldn't help myself and ended up looking through his room. I didn't have to look hard. I found about a dozen empty vodka handles casually stuffed under his bed and an open one on his nightstand. He is open about the weed use, even with my parents (who he lives with), and it's easy for him to get his hands on dabs since he's of age in CO. It was at this moment I realized how bad things had gotten. I chatted with him about it later that night and asked where he thought this path would lead him. He said, \"I know, I know... Alcoholism.\" But things have only gotten worse.\n\nSeveral times he's called me saying he drank too much and needs tips for sobering up before work. He drives for a living. Every single time he does this I tell him to CALL OUT, DO NOT DRIVE, but he makes some excuse about why he can't and inevitably goes in.\n\nAbout 8 weeks ago, my parents threw him out of the house. When my mom called him to ask where he would be sleeping, he said he didn't know, that he had just walked down to the local pub where he was spending his last $11. He had no plan. Later that night, he ended up breaking into her (unlocked) car in the driveway. He slept there for three nights before apologizing to my parents and promising to do better. He still hasn't told me about this--my mom did.\n\nIn the last 18mos, he has totaled 3 cars (admittedly one of those times was not his fault). The last one was particularly bad--he broke his hand and the doctor told him there could be permanent damage. Just this week his insurance company fired him as a client, and he can't afford the insane insurance rates at other places with his minimum wage job. And that means he's losing said job, as he works as a delivery driver. It might sound silly, but that job is his whole life right now. His entire social network. All of his friends. He's losing all of his friends. He's completely crushed.\n\nHe has no self esteem, at all. He's never been in a relationship. He tried college for a year, but my parents pulled him out due to bad grades/poor attendance. He sees no paths forward and often says things like I'll never have a good job, a wife, children, etc. \nIt doesn't help that my life is going pretty well, at least on the surface--I'm about halfway through my doctorate, in a six year relationship, should be starting the dissertation this time next year. He constantly refers to me as the Golden Child and himself as the family's black sheep. He doesn't believe me when I tell him exactly how difficult my life can be, will continue to be. He doesn't believe me when I tell him how much therapy/anti-depressants have helped me. He has labeled himself a failure.\n\nToday, when I tried to call him (three times) just to help/listen/provide support, he dodged every call. We haven't spoken in two weeks. When I called my mom to make sure things were okay, she told me he doesn't want to talk to me. He's shutting me out. I guess I understand on some level, but fuck, it hurts.\n\nMy brother is sweet and funny and honestly pretty good looking. He wanted to be a counselor and would be great at it. I'm so worried he's going to drive drunk and kill himself or someone else. I'm so worried he's going to commit suicide. \n\nWhat's more, my parents' marriage is beginning to fail. All they do is think about him and talk about him, and it's like a poison. They've been sleeping in separate rooms for 8 months.\n\nI love him so much, but our family is imploding over this and it's killing me. Thanks for reading.",

Alcohol was an essential part of nearly my entire life. \nTowards the end I was getting miserable. I calculated I would have 30 minutes of intense euphoria, then about 12 hours of misery. I enjoyed that 30 minutes a day so much that this cycle was repeated over and over. I hid my drinking from my family. There were vodka bottles stashed all around my garage.\nI was actually trying to conceptualize creating an antidote for alcohol. Of course this never happened, so I realized I needed to quit completely. \nThe last straw was my wife surprising me with a spur of the moment family outing to the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" restaurant show. I was so plastered that I was staggering around and could barely speak. My teenage children had to prop me up in the chair. I was so embarrassed that I admitted everything.\nThe next day I went cold turkey.\nI made it. I cannot believe I have done it. My only support is this group. I have very few close friends, and certainly no one to talk to about my addiction. There is also a fear of an impact on my job. If I have documented alcoholism, I jeopardize my professional license.  For the first few days I immersed myself in reading books about addiction. My favorites were \"A drinking life\" and \"Basketball diaries\"\nMy cravings are still there, especially when I drive home after work. \nI am being policed by my own virtue. I constantly say to myself \"I don't drink.\"\nMy wife thinks I am still drinking. Of course I was drinking exclusively vodka to avoid getting busted. She comes up to me and smells me every few minutes. This has become so annoying I am tempted to stop wearing deodorant.\nI think I have this beat. Even if I am permanently sober, I plan on checking in to this group forever.\nThanks everyone, and good luck to you\n",

   "selftext": "I kind of use it as a coping mechanism. I drink a lot of nights. I don't get hammered or blacked out drunk or anything, I just drink until I don't feel like it anymore, which is usually around 5 drinks depending on the night I guess. The thing about my drinking, is, I know it's wrong, and my closest friends don't like it, but they won't ever speak up about it. But what they don't know is why I drink. I use it to stop feeling the way I do when I'm sober at night. I've been sober the last three nights, and it was the worst three night stretch I've had in a long time. I was extremely suicidal last night; I went for a drive, because that usually calms me down but it didn't feel right, and I started to have think about driving as fast as I could into a tree or something. So I turned back and went home. I tried to talk to my friend about it, the only friend who knows I'm suicidal, but that didn't go so well. Now we're not on great terms, once again. She hates that I drink for the reasons I do, but she won't ever help me even though I've asked numerous times. I know it's a bad habit and I've tried quitting once before, but I barely lasted one night. These last few nights (where I was just too lazy to go buy more alcohol) have made me scared to quit drinking because I know what'll happen if I do without a reliable alternate coping method. There are people I want to talk to, a couple I consider close friends, some not as much, but I like them a lot and trust them. I just don't feel like it would be right. To talk about my alcohol use would mean bringing up my suicidal past and tendencies, things I've only ever talked about with one friend, who I trust more than anyone. I'm also not in great contact with these people. We're all apart since university is done for the summer, so it's not easy. I don't know what I expect from this post, but maybe I'll feel better getting some of these things off my chest to someone other than my unhelpful friend.",

Didnt think much about alcohol or drink beyond that.  \n\nUntil last Friday, when I drove to Tucson, AZ.  Tucson is this shitty little town where I went to college.  It's where my alcoholism developed, where I dropped out of school, but I have tons of friends there.  My hair stylist also lives there, so I drive to Tucson to see him and get my hair dyed.  Im weird, and getting my hair dyed red is part of my identity.  Lately my scalp has been a little damaged from allergies and itching, which makes the dying process unbearable, so I normally have a painkiller or a few drinks before he starts.  Only thing is, this time, I didn't stop.  Over the course of a good 4 days, I drank 2 bottles of wine, and 3 bottles of hard liquor.  \nI made a lot of really bad sexual decisions, as well, so now I'm very scared for my health.  And there isnt a lot I can do about it except abstain from sex and wait 3 months to get tested.   \n\nHere's to starting over.  I love that I was able to drink with family without any negative consequences.  But it's fair to say that at this point, it's just too great a risk for me to think I can entertain that sort of control.

He pointed out that Dad reeked of vodka and was slurring. Holy shit, he\u2019s right. Dad always smelled like that; that was just his smell. Of course this meant that Dad was secretly drinking every day our whole lives.      \n     I knew my dad liked the occasional vodka, but it turns out he always kept a bottle in his car trunk and drank from it throughout the day. He copped to this and has promised to stop a million times. I don\u2019t know if he was outright lying when he said this or just plain failed, but he lies about drinking all the time so he probably doesn\u2019t intend to stop.      \n     Today my mother told me a story that broke my heart. The other day, she came home and noticed my dad had gone out while she was away, which usually meant he went to the liquor store (something he promised to stop doing). She looked in his car and found the bottle, roughly 1/3 of it drank already. He was passed out in his chair. She went to pour it down the sink which was full of dirty dishes. He saw her and actually begged her to stop. When the bottle was empty, he began trying to drink what was left of it off of the dirty dishes and glasses. Right in front of her. For a man that had always denied secretly drinking, this was a particularly desperate move. My sister and I both broke into tears when we heard about this. \n     My dad\u2019s father, sister and twin brother are all alcoholics who quit drinking years ago. They have all experienced a \u201cbottom\u201d which gave them incentives to quit; spouses threatening to leave or humiliating themselves in public etc. My dad never had anything like that happen to him. He was a good dad and husband who held down a job for 35 years and never had any \u201cincidents\u201d at all. This could be why he doesn\u2019t feel like he has a real problem.      \n     Now my dad has congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. He can\u2019t walk 10 steps without gasping for breath and fluid is leaking from his legs. He had diabetes for a bit, as well. He won\u2019t accept that these symptoms are from excessive drinking. It\u2019s a hard situation because he\u2019s 67 years old and this has been his lifestyle for years and years. Only recently has he begun having health problems or any kind of consequence for his drinking. I imagine he drives drunk pretty often, considering how much and how often he drinks.      \n     I guess I\u2019m here because I\u2019m at a loss. I don\u2019t know what to do. He either denies things outright or pays lip service. He also recently retired, so he has nothing to do all day. Does anyone have a similar situation? How do I begin to help someone that doesn\u2019t really want help? I know the answer is that I can\u2019t because he has to want it or it will fail, but is there anything we can do to help get him to that place? This is going to kill him, I know it. TIA.",

   "selftext": "This is my first time here though I should have come a long time ago. This will be a long post with a lot of backstory so I apologize in advance. My mom and I were extremely close growing up and she was nothing but loving and supportive to me. Two years ago, things took a turn for the worst. I wasn't aware until recently, but apparently she has been addicted to pain meds for pretty much my entire life- she sustained a near-death accident when she was 18, and has had numerous surgeries since then. As such, she was always heavily prescribed meds and became addicted. My dad and her would fight about this frequently (never to my knowledge, I rarely if ever saw them actually have any serious verbal fight, and they have certainly NEVER had any physical fight). Anyways, my moms doctors stopped prescribing her pain meds at some point along the line- and she switched to alcohol. She never drank heavily but definitely always liked beer and would drink more than most other parents- but never liquor. She switched to liquor and began drinking in private, hiding bottles in our house, etc. It got very bad very quickly, but we (my dad, brother, and I) had no idea as we had never encountered real alcoholism. She passed out on the floor when my girlfriend (now-fiancee) came over for dinner one day. This was the first sign of a real problem. This was on a Sunday, and I was so embarassed that I left the house (I was living at home at the time). I went to work the next day, and came home and went straight to my room. My mom came home from work and wanted to talk acting like nothing was wrong. I was still furious with her and said \"I'm not talking to you until you apologzie for embarassing me and until we sit down and have a talk with Dad.\" She tries to change the subject and I ignore her. She sulks upstairs (drunkenly, though I didn't admit it/notice at the time). About 30 minutes late y dad rushes into my room asking what the fuck happened to my mother. Apparently, he came home to her sitting on our staircase, swaying violently, blind stupid drunk, drinking a 750mL Tito's bottle straight. She was crying and babbling about nothing and he put her in bed upstairs. She threw up violently and was just losing it. I'll never forget walking up those stairs to see her- the stairs she carried me up when I had a broken foot when I was younger. The stairs she chased me up when we were playing. The stairs she cried when she watched me walking down them for my first date/prom/graduation/moving out for college. The stairs that held so many fond memories were now a staircase to a hellish nightmare. I traversed the dark stairs, hearing her wails and sickness with each step. As I turned into her room, there was my mom, a soulless husk of the grand woman I have so much love and respect for. In short, she said she wanted and needed help. We took her to the ER where she got some benzos and we came home. She began an outpatient detox because she couldn't miss work. Started therapy sessions and going to AA. Things were going great for awhile- she would talk about her sobriety and celebrate milestone days (1 week, 1 month, 2 months). But she slowly stopped attending AA (said she didn't like the old people and depressing nature of it), stopped celebrating milestones, etc. She relapsed. Not as bad this time, just beer, but still relapsed and we had to find out by finding the bottles. Rinse repeat the cycle- less emotional this time, more anger on my part but not outward, still very understanding. Same cycle, did a physician-appointed at-home detox of sorts with my dads unwavering help and support. Weened her down. Things went well for longer than before- about 6ish months. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. I am engaged to be married (September 15th). My mom had talked about this moment my entire life and LOVES my fiancee. Wedding planning has been difficult though. My mom will get emotional about things, and even angry/lash out at me over small things (she is NOT an angry person, always the sweetest, gentlest woman I've ever known). I lose patience with her- she will get mad at me for not telling her about certain things with the wedding, though I have definitely already shared with her these things. She becomes more forgetful- I ignore the signs and grow disdain for her. I share less and less with her and go home less and less (maybe subconsciously I know she is drinking again, but can't handle the heartbreak of the lies and to see her in that state). My dad and brother (both at home) say nothing to me. Finally, I go home one night to discuss wedding stuff with my parents. My mom does not look well and is being very loud/animated. She says \"why haven't you shown me the wedding registry I haven't seen that\" when I had sent her the link mere days before. We go on and more of this continues, and my dad angrily yells at me at one point that \"this wedding is getting out of fucking hand\", which is bizarre because he has nothing to do with the wedding, the bride's family is handling it all as is tradition here in the States. Anyways, my mom is clearly very drunk, looking back, but I deny the signs and just think shes being stupid and head home early. Lying in bed, I can't shake the feeling of how \"off\" everything felt- I had dreaded goin home in the first place, and wanted to leave as soon as I got there. My house used to be a place of comfort- my friends would all come there and chat with my parents for hours. They'd come in times of happiness and sadness, because they loved my parents and parents were both so honest and welcoming and happy. We were never the richest and had financial problems, but our bond as a family was always strong. Lying in bed, I was overcome at how that feeling had gone completely to shit. I was overcome with how the happy memories of my mom were quickly fading and were being replaced with anger and resentment. My dad called the next day to apologize for his outburst. I said don't sweat it, hes stressed with work and whatnot, blah blah. But I gather up the courage to ask if mom is alright. Silence. He asks what I think. I say I think she's been acting increasingly irrationally, is forgetful, and that I think she's drinking again. He breaks down. She has been drinking liquor again at an increasingly alarming rate. In the morning, at work, on the way home in the car, and at home. Waking up in the night to drink. Lying to us. The car has damage from where she has hit curbs/backed up into things. She had made my dad and brother promise to not to me, as they are enablers and I am not. The last time this happened I had said if she drank again she would not be invited to my wedding (I realize this sort of ultimatum is probably not healthy but I honestly have no idea what the fuck I'm doing and am just lost and said what I fealt).They had got in a fight after I left because she was so happy I had come home to talk to them and said we had a great conversation- my dad said she had not pulled it off at all and he was embarrassed by her. My dad goes on and on about how she never wants to leave the house, and when they do she embarrasses him in front of their friends. He says \"I am fucking dying, son. I cannot keep doing this\". My dad has always been the light-hearted \"funny guy\" amongst our family and friends- to see him like this broke the little piece of my heart left that my mom hadn't already broken with her constant lies to my face about her problem. We talked for hours, I broke down in tears at my fiancees parents house. They now know her problem because I couldn't hide my emotions. Fast forward to today- my mom has underwent another successful \"weening\" detox and is 1 week sober (according to her and my dad). She is seeing her therapist again and, in my opinion, is sober and doing well. However, she is still hesitant to talk about alcoholism, and will not admit to friends that she has a problem. She also will not go to AA (she says its too depressing). I am extremely concerned with her having another relapse. I am concerned (selfishly) that my own mother will be too drunk at my wedding, and will embarrass me. I am concerned we won't have a mother-son dance. But most importantly, I'm just concerned for her. All my love for her is slowly leaving and getting placed with resentment- having her lie numerous times to my face to hide her drinking has ruined my trust with her. I question everything she tells me now, even in times of apparent well-being. What can I do? I have no friends who have been in a similar situation to seek guidance from. I just want my loving, sweet mother back, not this hellish shell of what she once was.",

So, when I'm not either high or drunk, I'm bored and restless, yet too nervous to actually do anything that may lead to embarrassment or failure. \n\nAbout 5 years ago, after catastrophically failing at life, I started smoking pot. Things were shitty, and I felt shitty, and it was an escape. This became an everyday thing very quickly. Whenever I move or lose contact with my dealer, I switch to 'functional alcoholism mode' until I find a new one.\n\nI honestly can't imagine life without substance abuse anymore. I can't remember the last time I was sober for over 24 hours. I remember being pretty depressed and extremely self destructive before I started self medicating. I'm afraid that I'll go back to that person when I stop. \n\nI cant tell my therapist just how bad it is either. I'm too scared that she'll get mad that I've been hiding it. Last time I was serious about my problem, the doctor suggested rehab. \n\nI can't do that. I just cant. I would feel so, so, so bad about myself. I would feel guilty for taking away from addicts with a more serious problem. I would feel pathetic for not just stopping. I'm not a raging alcoholic or a hard drug addict. I'm not a danger to myself or others. I'm just a pathetic wimp who can't stand my own thoughts or emotions. (Note: please excuse my harshness. I dont actually think pot addiction in itself is pathetic. I think I'm pathetic and this makes me more pathetic)\n\n People would laugh at me. Not to my face, but I know that they would.\n\n I don't want to do this anymore. I'm sick of being broke and caring more about pot then myself. But without it... I don't know what'll happen. I dont know how I'll feel (other then bad). \n\nI'm telling myself I'll just wait for my meds to kick in (going on two weeks on antidepressants). But what if they never kick in because of all the smoking? \n\nI'm just really scared.\n\nEdit: thank you all so much. This is a really nice community and I'm glad I joined.

   "selftext": "Hello,\nI\u2019m 22 and living at home and just found my moms hidden stash of wine (the bags from inside a box of wine hidden in a filing cabinet) for about the fifth time. This is a fairly new problem, I don\u2019t remember her drinking much when I was a kid. When they were older, she and my Dad started enjoying  wine some more and until the last year or so she usually kept it to a glass a night. After finding the wine this time I just threw it out. I usually confront her about it but have given up on that because the conversation usually goes to four topics:\n1. She\u2019s not my problem to worry about. If it bothers me that much I can just move out (would love to if it wasn\u2019t for student loans)\n2. It hasn\u2019t affected her work so clearly it\u2019s not a problem \n3. She\u2019ll be able to stop before it gets to be a problem \n4. The only reason she hides wine is because my dad and I give her grief when she drinks.\nThe last one is her favorite. Neither my father or I mind if she has a glass with dinner (I\u2019ll even have a glass of wine myself some nights). We also don\u2019t comment when she has a second glass. It\u2019s when she takes glass three after having two big glasses that sometimes we mention something. She\u2019s never been full on drunk but it\u2019s still concerning (probably because her tolerance is up). The part that gets me the most is a few months ago her brother had to seek help for his drinking. At that time she even admitted she wondered if there was a genetic predisposition. She still made no attempts to cut back! What do I do?Am I over reacting? Who do I talk to? She\u2019ll refuse to consider an AA meeting because she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem. I don\u2019t want to tell my father about this latest find because he has enough going on (new manangement at work and stuff going on with my grandmom). My mom just started seeing a therapist but I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s mentioned her drinking to them. I\u2019ve considered calling the previously mentioned Uncle but I don\u2019t know what he could do. This has truly driven me insane. I\u2019m anxious all the time about her hiding wine and checking her hiding spots has become a part of my daily routine (that\u2019s how I found this wine). I hate feeling the need to check the wine totals every night but I really can\u2019t trust how much my mom is drinking anymore. Any advice you can give would be greatly appreciated.",

I had no tools to deal with the nonsense my parents were making of their lives because all my traits and problem-solving skills were being taught to me by alcoholics. I know now that they were not only alcoholics, but they were mentally unhealthy, and booze just made it worse. They never had the tools to deal with life so how could they teach them to me? They used alcohol as their way to deal with life\u2019s problems, and in turn, that\u2019s what I picked up on and ended up doing it the same way. I actually hated the thought of drinking alcohol until I was in my late teens. I\u2019m not shitting on my childhood or parents, but this story wouldn\u2019t make sense if I didn\u2019t tell you what it was like. Even though I vowed never to drink when I was a kid, I still ended up drinking with friends at about the age of 18 and not once did I think it could ever become a problem because we were just having fun. I never thought about the fact that I would have to wrestle with my emotions, feelings, depression, and anxiety, because I hadn\u2019t known anything about the importance of mental health. Nobody wants to admit that they\u2019re sick, especially sick people that are teaching kids how to be adults.\n\n\nSo, knowing what I knew, I headed into adulthood believing that I was going to do great things in life. I had the optimism but none of the tools. I got into the car business at 18 as a salesperson and the cycle continued to get worse. I wasn\u2019t a drinker just yet but just about everyone I worked with was. It didn\u2019t take long for them to start getting me into bars, and it felt good because I was getting away with something, and more importantly, I was fitting in. I\u2019ve always had a lot of friends, but this was different, these guys were older than me and it felt good to be included. I had left the childhood where I was ashamed for having alcoholic parents, and instead, I now had alcoholic friends. It looks like I was paying attention to what I was taught when I was young.\n\nHow important was alcohol? Like a lot of young guys, it was all we talked about. We talked about how going to the bar to get drunk was the perfect thing for a car salesman because if you sold a car, you can go celebrate, and if you didn\u2019t you could go let off some steam. Either way, we were drinking. That should have sent me running away from the car business, but I saw nothing wrong with it. I figured that this is life and I\u2019m going to go with it. We went out all the time, and it cost me more money than I made, but it was fun. I felt like I was a part of something bigger than my childhood, and it felt good to be there. I was blind to the fact that these guys all had a serious problem. Here comes the cocaine! What a drug\u2026 for the first ten minutes. After that, you\u2019re chasing the first high you ever had but you never get there. For me, it was another bond with the guys, something else I felt like I was a part of. How I didn\u2019t end up a complete bust out (car guy term for loser), is beyond me. That was the life I was creating for myself with the life information I had at the time. Looking back, I feel like I should\u2019ve seen bad times coming, but what did I know?\n\nThank God it was easy to lay off coke when I wanted to, or had to, because I would run out of money. Either way, I was putting myself in a position of failure and I wasn\u2019t even 25 yet. I spent my 20\u2019s on a bar stool with people that didn\u2019t give a shit about me or where I was headed. I don\u2019t know if I cared about them either. That\u2019s not to say that I haven\u2019t made, and still have great friends from that time in my life, but you find out that people don\u2019t give a shit real fast when things go bad.\n\nI got married when I was 31, and by then, I was drinking daily. I had life altering anxiety and alcohol was the fastest way to cure it. I couldn\u2019t do anything or go anywhere without being in full panic. The idea of having to communicate with another human being scared the hell out of me. I had no idea what was going on. That anxiety turned on like a light switch and I was done. I had no answers and I was afraid to look weak in front of people. I had sucked it up for so many years, I thought I just needed to do it again, and that\u2019s how I lived. I don\u2019t even want to type this stuff from the memory of it, but doing it always gets me past it. That\u2019s one way I deal with problems now. I go back to a period of time when I wasn\u2019t doing well and write it out, so I can feel how I felt at that time. Many times, a new memory from a situation will show itself and that allows me to deal with it and assure myself that I was never in any danger. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trying to go back to my 5-year-old brain and tell the little guy that everything worked out.\n\nThere is way more to tell but It\u2019ll have to be another article, so I\u2019ll end it here with my point. From the time I could walk, alcohol was a big part of my life and continued to be for nearly 40 years. It was a major focus with everything I did, until I decided enough was enough, and decided to get healthy. If we can focus on making ourselves better human beings instead of focusing on not drinking, I believe that we\u2019d have much more success at becoming recovered alcoholics. I\u2019m going to keep telling these stories until people start having \u2018ah ha\u2019 moments in the comments section, and this spreads so far and wide, that we become nondependent on alcohol or can at least help the people who are. My whole purpose for these blogs is to help people understand that your recovery doesn\u2019t have to be a lifetime thing and you can be recovered. Just because I\u2019ll never drink again, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m against alcohol\u2026 just the abuse. Please share what you like!",

   "selftext": "Alcoholism runs on both sides of my family. I didn\u2019t start drinking until I was around 19, because I didn\u2019t want to risk addiction. Then I had a bad night, friend had alcohol, and I took him up on his offer. I suppose, I\u2019m a way it\u2019s been down hill from there. \n\nIt started with drinking socially sometimes on the weekends, I still passed up alcohol quite a bit. That changed when I got out of an abusive relationship, I started drinking every weekend and it was what I had to look forward to during the week. \nI got out of that habit and returned to just drinking occasionally after turning 21. \n\n\nThings were fine until recently. \nI stayed with family for a week, and since I was off campus, and since I wasn\u2019t paying for my drinks I drank daily. I drank quite a bit more than my usual.\n\nAfter that week I went without drinking for 1 week and was very on edge by the weekend. All I could think about was alcohol, and that\u2019s where I am now. \nI\u2019ve drank the past 5 nights, and have some inset aside for tonight and tomorrow. Every time something bad happens, or I feel down i start craving alcohol. I can\u2019t look at alcohol ads without craving alcohol. I feel like it\u2019s always on my mind these days. \n\nI think I\u2019m starting to have a problem,  but I can\u2019t make myself care. Part of me knows I should, but the other part of me just can\u2019t. \nI worry most about people finding out and cutting me off or being disappointed in me, or mad at me. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m in a position where I feel like I can\u2019t just stop, but also I feel like my problem isn\u2019t bad yet or anything , so I don\u2019t want to seek help. \nI also just don\u2019t want to lose my coping mechanism. \n\nI just feel like I am at a crossroads and need to make some big decisions now, but don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m ready to.",

   "selftext": "Note: rambling post\n\nIn my late teens, I had a thing for a girl. She for me too. Stars just didn't align... until they did. \n\nStill remember the first date. Went to see \"How High\". The kiss at the end of the evening was an experience I've not experienced since: butterflies, fireworks, etc.\n\nSoon, we were hanging out often and became sexually active. One of those situations where young kids explored each other. I wasn't a virgin, but the first time with her,  I got so nervous, my heart was beating out my neck.\n\nOne day, she was real quiet. I'm thinking \"shit, I know where this is going\", and prepped myself to deal. But she got even more shy, stuttered, red in the face... \"&lt;My name&gt;, I love you\"\n\nI was shell shocked. I mean, I felt strongly about her but love? Had a long couple days thought and realized yeah, I do.\n\nWe were together much more often. I met her grandparents even. It got to the point that she would stay with me at the house for weeks at a time (made my mom uncomfortable).\n\nAfter a couple years, circumstances led to it becoming a distance thing. It was so awful being apart. I made it *sooooooo* much better for getting jealous and overbearing. It was my fault it ended. I had my night of rage: breaking shit, crying, drinking.\n\nBut it became evident that I was now broken. Just numb.\n\nI did everything to move on: lifting weights, drinking, pot (huge pothead for about 2 years), progressively heavier drugs, joined a frat, became very promiscuous.\n\nI decided to stay an extra summer semester after walking, just to do college things. Well, she didn't know. Figured since I had \"graduated\" and had a job up there, I'd be a text away. Text message at 10, by 10:05, I was rage quitting. Liquor, coke, pills. Last thing I remember was my frat bro kicking me out of the house for punching a hole in the fence. Came to the next morning, crushed.\n\nThere was another girl that was close: we kinda crushed for a year and just informally  went for it the last semester and summer before we moved on. But when we broke it off, it was different. We got upset, but it's one of those times you just look back fondly.\n\nAfter graduation, I entered the work force. I was nowhere near my friends, so I just sat there, sulked, and slipped into alcoholism. I needed structure, I converted to a different religion and it provided that structure, and something to focus on besides her.\n\nAfter a few years, I got married. It seemed like the thing to do. Shes from a completely different culture than me, but I thought whatever, this will work.\n\nWe got close, intimate. We had a kid. When his diagnosis came, it crushed me. I thought, what if I was still with her? Would I have a child who wasn't normal (whatever the fuck that means)?\n\nOne day, I got to thinking about her. That caused another round of chemical addiction. In the meantime, I decided to get my PhD. Just anything.\n\nAnother 5 years go by (now) and I run into her. She's divorced, couple kids. First  time I've actually come into actual contact in 14 years. Nothing has changed on my end.\n\nThings with my wife have deteriorated. Cultural differences are VERY apparent now. Just together for the kid.\n\nI got to thinking last night: I still remember everything about her: eye color (green), clothes size (4, she's still a 4), various birthmarks, the stupid laugh she has when you tickle her tat, her favorite dress, favorite perfume, favorite song (that lame \"Falling Even More in Love With You\") and even goddamn favorite cigarette brand.\n\nI know maybe 2 of those things about my wife.\n\nWe've kept in touch every so often over IM, FB but it's not the same. I have that wave of numb again when I saw her face to face. \n\nI am an asshole but I would leave it all for her. I mean, I'd want to take my son, but the wife is a vicious lawyer and I probably wouldn't see him again.\n\nFucking 14 years of this shit. It's obsessive. She's had to have moved on at this point, why can't I?\n\n*I'm so lonesome, I could cry*\n\n- Hank Sr.",

So I kind of don't live with them, yet kinda do. \n\nMy mother is super super paranoid about everything, especially alcohol. I don't blame her, her aunt died from complications of prolonged alcohol abuse and her mother (my grandmother) also went through it. \n\nBut, she is constantly calling me an alcoholic. My definition is someone who cannot go without alcohol and 'needs' it. Fair enough, I do drink a fair amount, I go out a lot, especially because a lot of my friends are bartenders. \n\nIt doesn't matter what I say to her, she thinks because I drink a lot, I must be an alcoholic.

   "selftext": "I almost made a throwaway, but I should just own this.\n\nUntil August 14, 2017 I was a daily drinker for 15 years.  I knew I was an alcoholic but I didn't care.  Like everyone else here I decided to sober up.  Literally every bad thing in my life was the result of drinking.  I wasted most of my 20s and 30s and I have to live with that.  The summary of what is going on with me is my alcoholism has shifted from daily drinking to binge drinking every couple months.\n\n\n\nThe pattern is always the same.  I quit, and after a couple days of feeling off, I feel good again.  I keep feeling better and better.  Its easy.  The ironic shit about that is its almost too easy.  When I start looking back at 50-60-70 days sober without it really being a struggle after day 2-3, the voice in my brain kicks in.  It tells me I'm a problem drinker that goes too far, but not really an alcoholic.  \n\n\n\"CtrlAltDelLife, alcoholics can't quit for months at a time like its no big deal!  Stop waffling between extremes and find some balance in your life!\"\n\n\nSo I do, and I end up on a binge for a week before I quit again and hate myself.  And the problem is I want to listen by that point.  I WANT to be able to go to happy hour after work once or twice a month.  I WANT to visit my family and sit with my aging dad on the back porch with a beer a few times a year.  I WANT those things back.  But that is not the reality of my mind and my body.  If I choose to be the person who can have those things, I'm choosing to give up and risk everything else.  I am much happier sober, and that leads me right back to giving in after a couple months when it starts to feel like, \"no big deal.\"  The fact I still romanticize it like that after a couple months isn't cool.\n\n\nThis time the cards really stacked well against me, and I saw it coming and did nothing to counter it.  In retrospect I planned this lapse.  I got a new job, a big raise, and a week off between jobs ending in a holiday weekend.  My wife loves me, but she doesn't drink and tends to follow my self assessments when I suggest these 2+ month stretches are a sign it, \"wasn't all that bad\", and \"I can be balanced.\"\n\n\nI have read/heard many times that the body and brains healing after long term alcohol abuse happens in some pretty pronounced phases.  2 of the big ones being 90 days and 6 months.  If that is the case I'm never even making it out of the first phase and I have no idea how good I may start to really feel.  I have also read/heard many times that relapsing after short duration of sobriety effectively reset the brain's healing back to day 1.  Not suggesting 60-70 days isn't good progress, but from a purely biological level its basically erased.\n\n\n\nI think it is time to legitimately try Smart or AA.  I need a continuous support system for when I start telling myself 2 months or more without any issues is proof of some bullshit.  When I romanticize the unmatched chilling out level and chemical euphoria that to be honest aren't even real.  I have avoided AA after some bad experiences in the past.\n\nI realize by typing that last bit I have sent out a telepathic signal that will summon Frank :)  But as I said, I'm going to try again because there are many different meetings and I live in a different part of the country now.  I need to find one that is right for me.\n\n\nThank you all for reading.  Lets try this again.",

Then I started realizing I was a little more social when I drank. I have terrible anxiety and (undiagnosed but I'm sure) ocd. So then I started drinking to aid in socializing. My father's an alcoholic it was never hard to get alcohol, in fact it was encouraged. The last 3 years the most I've went without drinking was 4 days. The alcohol used to help me be social and help with the spcial anxiety and anxiety from intrusive thoughts. Now I can't escape them even drunk, but I continue to drink. When I wake up the first thought is drinking and I usually drink with my breakfast. The rebound anxiety is so terrible when I don't drink that I have to get drink to even bare it, yet its still there and I still have panic attacks drunk. This is not a life I want to have.

   "selftext": "I was seeing a guy for about a month. Things turned really sour when he became very irritable with me and would get into moods where he would become quite insensitive. This obviously triggered me and he went on to say that he is a 'jerk' and is going to get '100 percent jerkier' and if I want to continue dating him, I have to be ok with this. He expressed that he needs to be with a girl who will put him back in his place when he acts like this and because he has a drinking problem, he is likely to get meaner after drinking. This is not the relationship that I am after, especially having BPD, so we both agreed to end it there.\n\n\n\nIt was a terrible decision, but we agreed to stay friends with one another and communicated via Facebook messenger. We'd get into this routine where we'd chat like we used to before we got romantically involved, then one of us would confess to each other that we still had feelings for each other, we'd both agree that we found talking was making it difficult and to give each other some space until we were ok to talk again. After that agreement, I would get these overwhelming impulses to contact him and talk to him because it felt that when we took that time apart, my feelings for him grew stronger and became really intense. I'd have this overpowering need to speak to him and I'd break the agreement and  cave in. I would then realise that it was best to give it time, I'd apologise and back off. This cycle went on for about a month and each of these discussions were spaced around a week to two weeks apart. During every one of these discussions he continued to speak me to me like usual and he quite willingly engaged with me. He even told me that I can break the contact rule at any time if I was in a bad place and needed someone to talk to because he still 'really cares' for me.\n\n\n\nAfter the last agreement for no contact, I caved in and got in touch to tell him that I really wish we were able to make it work and that I was struggling to move on. He responded saying that he feels exactly the same and that something deep down makes him want to say, 'stuff it lets just be together', but he knows deep down because of his alcoholism, it would be catastrophic for both of us. Two days passed with no discussion between us and I continued the conversation. He said that he was just drunk when he wrote that stuff to me, he doesn't even remember saying things about still having feelings for me as they are no longer there for him anymore.  I tried to engage further and he ignored my messages, which set me off to ask him if he was ignoring me.\n\n\n\nAfter two days, I wrote in to apologise for bombarding him with those messages and he told me that he is done talking with me now and doesn't want to have anything to do with me anymore because I keep getting in touch, I keep asking the same questions and it keeps going around in circles and he just wants to have some peace. He said that he has told me time and time again not to communicate with him (however he never once did express this), he has tried to be polite and has tried to respond to my messages but now he wants to cut off all contact for good. I apologised profusely to him as I felt terrible for misreading the situation and overstepping his boundaries. I felt so ashamed by this and begged him not to end it on such sour terms and he told me that it's the only way and he can't help how I feel. I asked him if this is really what he wants and he said 'there is another question, I told you to stop communicating with me, yet you still keep going'. I then expressed that I will respect his decision to stop interacting and apologised for all of this.  He read my last message, ignored it and then deleted me off all social media.\n\n\n\n\nI have been struggling to cope within the last few days since this happened as I am filled with these immense feelings of worthlessness and shame for being such a nuisance to him and behaving in a way that was disrespectful to his boundaries. I am also filled with a lot of anxiety and feel this will cause me social isolation as he hangs out in a big social crowd that I can't really avoid when I go out and I am concerned he will talk about me and tell people how annoying and unstable I am,etc and that people will judge me for it.\n\n\nDoes anyone have any insights as to how I can help get myself up from here?",

Nofap made me look differently to my life and it made me realize that shit happens to people if they want it or dont. For me I life with my house mates they are all 10 years older than me and you know more experienced in life. They often tease me that I'am to young to understand many things I'm still a child compared what they went throught. For example one of them \\(one of the roomates\\) was a drug addict he got stabbed for owning money, other goes to prostitutes and last one is alcoholic. But they are not the mean type but more like everything what they do is normal type. Once there was a party at our house I met other my nation people they were a couple but they often fight and curse at each other. I sat down and asked the women why do you keep fighting like this and still be with him and the answer didnt shock me but made me less be happier about life overall what she say'd was '' We need everything in our lifes it would be boring for me if we would not do drugs drink alcohol or fight, it would be awfully boring living a peaceful life''. Being a person what was raised in very peaceful family with no alcoholism no fight only love and strict rules. It made me think It **would be a lot easy'er to live unhealthy life and be happy partly with no goals in life no people to really love. Instead of trying to make your life better.** It really messed me up peopl**e like me who try to perfect themselves usually become alone addicted to porn and keeps climbing obsticles witch never disappea**r. I keep thinking what will happen out of me will become like them happy but with many problems hiding them and pretending nothing is there or I will be alone searching for people who understand me.\n\nI keep seeing myself around people who are not like me but worse but how to escape it if the life itself led me here, does it want me to become like this or what",

   "selftext": "Hi everyone. I apologize in advance if I ramble a bit, but I've made the decision to quit and want to get all my thoughts out there and get some advice from those of you who've done it already.\n\nI took Kratom for the first time last August. So less than a year ago. While I DO consider myself to have a somewhat addictive personality, I have no history of opioid abuse/addiciton or anything like that. I drink alcohol occasionally, but have no issues with abuse or alcoholism. I started pretty slowly and experienced all the positive benefits we probably all associate with Kratom. As I'm sure is typical, I slowly started to use it more and more often and at slightly higher doses. Truthfully I didn't do the proper research or read about any possible negative long-term effects, so in my mind I was totally fine taking it as often as I wanted. It got rid of any desire to drink alcohol, which I perceived as another positive and more reason to continue.\n\nAround February, I decided I needed to take a month off to prove to myself that I wasn't addicted. I quit CT for about 27 days in February-March. I experienced extremely low energy and a lot of fatigue, but I was also on a calorie restricted diet at the time and working out more than usual, so I chalked my low energy levels up to that. At the time, I didn't even CONSIDER that this may be due to the Kratom withdrawal. After the 27 days, I slowly started to take small doses again, which then led back to the daily use at higher doses. A couple weeks ago, I started getting random runny noses which I found really odd. I decided I needed to take another break to prove to myself that I could do it, if I wanted to. Towards the beginning of May, I quit CT for about 10-11 days. The low energy/lethargy was MUCH worse this time around, and this time it was made even worse because I KNEW it was from the withdrawal. I have a very rigid workout routine, so I train every single day. I always work out in the morning, and get through my workouts just fine with high energy, but about an hour after I'm done training, the low energy hits very hard and sticks with me the rest of the day. I've also started experiencing depression symptoms, which I've NEVER had issues with in my life. High anxiety and bad depression which have been the absolute worst part of the withdrawal. I can deal with the low energy, but the depression is so new to me and I can't allow myself to go through it. I have two daughters and a wife, so it's fucking humiliating to me that I have had to come to terms with the fact that I got addicted to this stuff that I didn't even know existed less than a year ago.\n\nAfter my last 10 day quit, I tried to slowly pulse in low doses again with days off in between. It worked for a couple days, until, of course, the same thing happened again and I started dosing every day. That leads up to today. I woke up with crippling anxiety and a terrible depressed mood this morning. I'm at the point where I know, without question, that I need to quit for good. This is where I am hoping to get some advice or tips. Based on my rambling story, do you guys think quitting CT again (for good) is my best option? I just hate the anticipation of how bad the depression/anxiety/low energy is going to be. But I also don't want to taper and draw this stuff out any longer than I have to.\n\nIn your experiences, how quickly do you think the mental issues go away once you quit CT? And have any of you had any luck with any natural remedies to help with the low energy and depressive mood? I'm 100% ready and committed to being done, but I'd like to take the smartest route possible. \n\nFor reference, my usual daily intake is probably 10-12G. Some days it was more, some days it was less... but I never really got to the point where I was taking 50-60G per day like I've seen some people do. Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read!",

   "selftext": "\n\nOkay so I am in a relationship with a man I love very much but he has a lot of anxiety. To deal with this, he drinks and has told me that previously he would drink 12 beers a night just to be able to fall asleep. \n\nHe went to a large party school for college where he would drink to the point of blacking out every weekend and would drink everyday. I guess his friends acted as a crutch for him and would make sure he got home and in bed because he would lose all mental and motor function. We went to visit his college last fall for a football game and his friends all met us there, and he got drink to the point where he blacked out and cheated (made out with another girl), with no memory of the incident. \n\nIronically, he and I both found out the night before we were moving in together so for that and other reasons I made the decision to move in anyway (although in hindsight maybe it was a sign) and work on the relationship. I black out that night as well (very rare for me) and since I have never gotten that drunk again, out of pride and shame in the incident and that I was too inebriated to know myself. \n\nFast forward, my boyfriend still gets drunk and drinks every day. It ranges from 3 to up to as much as 16-17 beers a day (like today) and still blacks out here and there, though not as often as before. It makes me very bitter that this sort of drinking nearly cost our relationship and hurt me emotionally but it is not enough to not binge drink or at least to set limits or not black out ever again. I have brought it up that he should cut back his drinking and even that it makes me nervous that he can get that drunk (due to the infidelity) and he doesn't take it well. His tolerance is really high so he can walk and such, but I know he relies on it to relax and sometimes to sleep so I know he has a problem. I have not given him an ultimatum because I personally think there are healthier ways to get the same outcome, but I know I need to make myself more clear. \n\nHow can I communicate to him that this must change without sounding like the bad guy?

I hope I'm okay in posting about this topic. \n\nI myself am not an alcoholic but my husband is an alcoholic. I've noticed what I would consider to be severe alcohol related health symptoms in him for years. He's in his late 30s and drinks between 12-30 drinks a day. He vomits every morning. Nose bleeds. Among other things. This past year he's been admitted to the hospital on three occasions for pancreatitis, a blood transfusion due to low hemoglobin and GI bleeding/hemorrhoids/leisons on stomach. As well as probably at least 100 trips to the emergency room in 5 years for various ailments.\n\n Each time I go I adamantly  mention alcohol consumption but he downplays it with the doctors. When he comes home he says he's fine, shows me discharge papers and it never mentions alcohol, liver, kidneys, etc. There was only one ER doctor who said he thought it was alcohol related and to ask his primary for a liver and kidney ultrasound. The literature this doctor gave him spooked him out but only for a few days because it was only the doctor's opinion and they did not do any testing in the ER. Only offered rehab info/AAinfo and asked if he'd like to stay until sober. \n\nI don't know anything about the way this disease can progress physically. I've read some symptoms on Google and this doesn't sound good. Is it possible these symptoms are related to something else? Is there a way to get the doctors to do specific tests? Should I have him go to a specific type of doctor? I understand I cannot force him to do anything, and he may have been offered these tests but has lied to me about it. I know his doctors have done blood work but he claims his liver levels are fine. I'm worried about his health and its my fear he could get bad news. We are not living together anynore but still communicate frequently and have very young children. It's probably not my role/place to be asking but I don't know where else to ask. Hoping everyone is having a healthy &amp; happy evening. Thank you for reading. ",

   "selftext": "Could do with some advice on how to handle this situation....\n\nSo I have suffered with social anxiety for a long time. For the last couple of years of my alcoholism, I have barely seen anyone. I'm used to being on my own, being very independent and doing my own thing.\n\nHaving started attending AA this week, I've met some people who I consider I get along with, but I wouldn't call them 'friends', they're very different to me, but we have bonded over our respective addictions. Anyway, a couple of these people got wind that i have a car, and now they keep asking me for lifts to and from every meeting. Its absolutely sending my anxiety through the roof because I HATE having people rely on me! The odd lift if they're stuck is ok, but even within the space of a week it seems to have become a given! It's making me angry as I think 'well I've only been at AA a week, and you managed before I came along!'. Also, there's the cost aspect. One of the girls was telling me how much she usually spends on taxi's, yet hasn't given me any money! I'm absolutely skint at the moment, and I can barely afford to run my car as it is, let alone ferry everyone else around from different locations in the process.\n\nIt's my car, and my money running it, and it was a major step for me to walk into AA and if I'm going to be taken advantage of like this, then it's making me not even want to go to AA. I am going to AA for ME! To help myself recover from alcoholism, not to be a taxi service. I feel like crying. It's my first week, it's fucking hard, and you'd think they would remember how it feels and not put any additional pressure on me. I hardly know these people, if I wanted to give them a lift I'd offer. It's making me want to crawl back into my shell and say fuck it to AA. Any advice on what to say to get them to back off would be welcome IWNDWYT.",

He admitted that he had a problem, and would reguarly go to the shop in the morning for another drink. We want to help him, but being quite a solitary person, we have always struggled to get him out the house or doing anything outside of his comfort zone.\n\nWe know he has developed some health problems, high blood pressure as well as being diabetic, but upon finding  some information from his doctor that had not been filled out as it should, we are worried that he is going to get himself in to some serious difficulties.

   "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nI\u2019ve never posted on here, but I\u2019ve read through so many of these boards and this is one incredible, virtual support group. I guess I\u2019m turning to everyone on here for a little advice on how to cope with the loss of my brother who could not stop drinking.... \n\nAs the title of my post states, I lost my dear brother to an alcohol addiction this past week. This is a pain I\u2019ve never even come close to feeling and wouldn\u2019t wish upon my worst enemy. To see my parents whale in sorrow every night is a close second for things I never want to experience in my time on this planet. \n\nMy brother was an absolutely incredible person. He was handsome, a man serving others in his career and a source of laughter and happiness for our family. We noticed his addiction grow steadily worse over the past 8 years but we live in a small town where drinking is very prevalent. Also, alcoholism runs on both sides of the family so it\u2019s sort of something we are \u201cused to\u201d unfortunately. There\u2019s always that drunk Aunt or Uncle embarrassing themselves at family parties and no one thinks anything of it, because it\u2019s a generational disease that has plagued our family. I\u2019ve had my fair share of alcohol fueled embarrassments and run ins with the law that I\u2019m not proud of. I\u2019ve been in counseling for most of my life and have to make a conscious effort to stop drinking once I start. My brother on the other hand was on a completely different level. He used to drink a fifth a night of vodka straight and he didn\u2019t have that switch that said \u201cok, it\u2019s time to stop.\u201d I am not saying I\u2019m any better than him, my \u201con/off switch\u201d has definitely been broken many times but not to the level his was. \n\nWe\u2019ve confronted him and begged him to seek help for YEARS. All of our family functions, holidays, etc. have all centered around making sure he didn\u2019t have too much (or any) exposure to alcohol. My parents helped pay most of his bills so that his sole job was to spend all of his energy on fighting this disease. But nothing worked. \n\nWe thought he was in AA for the last 6 months and out of respect for his privacy, we decided not to pry into his progress. He would mention meetings or milestones here and there and we would balk at his success. I sent him countless cards, texts, voicemails filled with encouragement and pride for this demon he was facing head on. All the while, he had never really stopped and was still living this life of secrecy in his room. He would tell my parents how he hated being at restaurants because of all the drinking around him, but would then go right home and drink a fifth in his bedroom. When he was found dead this week by my poor father (who will never get that image out of his head), we were all dumbfounded. We thought he was getting better, we thought he was beating this! \n\nI can\u2019t quite come to grips with this loss and WHY it happened. Why didn\u2019t our words and actions help? Why was he powerless over this drug? Why didn\u2019t he reach out and tell us he fell off the wagon and needed help? Why do some people beat this and others don\u2019t? I\u2019m so lost and so heartbroken without him and I just can\u2019t help but keep asking myself WHY. \n\nAlso, for anyone struggling and your family is on your back, it\u2019s only because they love you more than anything and they want you here. They want you at every family function, they want you to meet their future children and attend their weddings. You are good enough, you are worth fighting for and your family is coming from a place of intense love. Please, I\u2019m begging you to listen \ud83d\udc97",

Or so I thought. \n\nI heard someone say in a meeting the other day, \\(paraphrasing\\), \"I wasn't drinking, but I was still drunk.\" I realized that even when I wasn't drinking last year I wasn't changing myself, I held on to beliefs and ideas that rationalized and justified bad behavior and emotional abuse. I may as well have still been drinking since I wasn't making any effort to grow. I still had blinders on. I wasn't listening \\(especially to women, or my succinctly, to one in particular\\). \n\nI realized alcoholism and having trouble with alcohol isn't necessarily about having a problem with drinking; it's about have a fragile emotional constitution that can't hold up to the effects of substances that change your mental state. I know now that it is my duty to change myself by first realizing that much of what I let define myself is wrong and needs to be rebuilt from the ground up. I am scared at the prospect of having to do that. I don't know what it means for who I will become. \n\nIt took losing an entire life and some of my dearest friends to realize that I had a problem. That I wasn't properly looking outside of myself at my own behavior. I finally looked back and saw how all the times I lashed out at people there was a common thread: alcohol. How all these times were related. The anger, the text messages, the emails. I was always drunk. I never thought about it because I thought I was justified in getting angry. \n\nAnd probably one of the things I have the hardest time with is that while I acknowledge that I need to grow and let go of resentments past and present many of those resentments are predicated upon a perception that there are injustices wrought upon certain types of people in this world. And I don't want those to be collateral to me changing and learning not to rely on other people. I think in general we need to show people more compassion especially when they are socially maladjusted or aneurotypical. That mental health isn't just a problem for the individual to overcome, but a collective problem that is incumbent upon all both the afflicted and the not to help in resolving. Unfortunately I used those beliefs as a cudgel to lash out at people and I feel I delegitimized those sentiments in the process. \n\nI'm struggling a lot right now. I feel very isolated. I missed my best friend's birthday because she wants to keep distance from me right now because she feels she was enabling behavior that if she were in the position of the person I was acting that was towards, she would feel unsafe. We are going to reconnect in mid\\-June and she said she would go to an AA meeting with me, but I feel like I undermined her trust in me through how I acted. \n\nI moved to a new city six months ago and I only have a few friends. I mostly just work, come home and sit in bed all day watching television and movies. I'm scared it's never going to get better. I have no motivation to do anything. I can't get people to notice me or be friends with me or date me. I have no idea how to get people's attention. How to get invited to things. How to make friends. I barely function socially. I'm scared. I'm trying but I don't know if I have the patience. ",

   "selftext": "In 1995 i went overseas for 2 years. I left behind an awful relationship, i was just out of college. Well, the two years abroad was awful in many ways. I was under contract to teach English in Japan. I was placed in a really small town where there was a LOT of alcoholism, drinking after work...anyway it was awful in so many ways. I was extremely lonely. I started drinking due to pressure of people around me, even though much of my childhood was spent watching my alcoholic father abuse my family. I started exhibiting signs of depression and anxiety and had panic attacks. \n\nFF to 2018, i came back in 1997. Wow i learned a LOT of Japanese there that i still remember, i genuinely love Japanese and the culture and genuinely miss it. But everytime i see a pic of my former town i have this inner twinge or flinch. 'So glad i'm not there anymore...' i mutter to myself. I truly cannot help it. A shudder of helpless ...rage or pain or anguish flows through me and i clench inwardly and start muttering to myself about how much i hated it there. \n\nAnd the weirdest thing is? I want to visit. I want to speak Japanese. I crave Japanese foods and the writing and all kinds of things. But some of the things i went through there - getting over my ex was a huge part of it, and being trapped alongside all the destructive drinking and being a participant in it myself, was another - i don't think i'll ever get over it. I don't think it'll ever leave me alone, it will never stop haunting me, i'll never forget how painful those two years were. Like pain was eating me alive and i couldn't do anything about it except succumb. \n\nThanks for listening. I am on medication to control my depression and feel 100% better. I am married and was over my ex a long time ago. I no longer have anxiety attacks. I rarely drink. But it seems some things never leave you in peace. \n\nThat's all. ",

Two days ago I was too busy to drink, then the next day I stared at my bottle of wine for an hour or so before putting it away. I was gonna go for a third day today, but failed. Failing wasn\u2019t what bothered me though. \n\nIt all started when a friend suggested we grab some beer, I agreed of course. He was buying since I was broke. He goes to check out but can\u2019t buy the beer since he still has a vertical ID (he just turned 21 a week ago). \nI\u2019m on edge after this. I\u2019m anxious, im mad, I stay calm though and expain he\u2019s 21 if they look at the ID. Turns out it\u2019s some new corporate policy and they can\u2019t do anything  so we leave. I have to bite my tongue to keep from saying something rude which isn\u2019t like me at all, and I feel bad for feeling so mad. \n\nWe decide to just go somewhere else to buy beer, and all goes well. I knew I had an exam  tomorrow and needed to study, I knew I shouldn\u2019t have drank, but I did. I knew I should have stopped at 1 (my norm since I\u2019m very much a lightweight since I\u2019m a really small guy + my meds increase effects) but I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t feel anything after 1 this time, and I barely felt anything after the second but was just buzzed enough that I couldn\u2019t study. \n\n\nI studied a bit after sobering up enough. Now that I\u2019m sober I have a headache and I\u2019m tired and super depressed and guilty feeling. I hate how bad I felt when I thought I wasn\u2019t going to get to drink tonight, I hate that I chose drinking over school work for the first time, I hate that my tolerance is changing. I hate that my reaction to all his is that I want to drink more then go to bed. \nI hate that I might fail my exam. \n\nI feel like my problems are small, but I just really needed to talk about them and didn\u2019t know where to go.\n\n",

He has admitted to being alcoholic for over ten years but doesn\u2019t see the problems alcoholism has caused, namely in our relationship. He is highly educated but lost his job due to budget cuts. He is applying for jobs but hasn\u2019t heard a word back. The big reason he hasn\u2019t gotten any interviews is because he hasn\u2019t done the type of professional development that is required for his field. I have been supportive and helpful , giving him pep talks, building him up, and encouraging him to take the time now to make himself more competitive.  We had a big blow out several weeks ago over the out of control drinking and sleeping all day and locking his office door to watch porn while I\u2019m in the next room. I flipped out.   Normally during the work week he has equivalent to a six pack every night, but when he\u2019s not working it\u2019s worse. Since he\u2019s been dry he\u2019s been very nasty to me, or just gives me the silent treatment for days.

   "selftext": "I had to do this today. The truth is, while I've successfully -- so far -- deleted alcohol from my body, alcoholism did some serious things to my life. Just being sober did not mean everything would feel amazing. I have a lot of things in life to change. \n\nFirst, know it's never too late to change. My grandfather recovered at 52 and has lived more a life since then than we can ever ask for. You do not need to worry about your timing in all of this. \n\nAnyway, I sat down in silence and made four columns on my notepad. I really want you guys to do this if you feel overwhelmed, lost, anxious or depressed about your drinking and your life. \n\nIn column one, just write down your feelings. Your negative thoughts. Things you resent. Things beyond your control that make you sad. Just write it all down! Now circle them, and know that anything inside that circle can be pushed to the side for now. \n\nIn column two, title it Things I Don't Have to do Anymore. This is for anything you know drags you down. No. 1 should be alcohol. Let it go past that though. Here were mine: Eat unhealthy, drive drunk, regret texts, forget things from drinking, poor financial management, avoid people because of alcohol or to hide habits of alcohol, aimlessly scroll social media constantly, seek out negative news, gain weight, look at porn, sleep weird hours. \n\nNow, in column three, write down whatever the opposite of the item in column two is. A few for me: drink 8 glasses of H2O a day, eat a fruit for breakfast, eat a veggie at dinner, offer to DD for friends (good way to meet new people actually), run in mornings, weights in evenings, find positive blogs to follow, meditate daily, binge comedies, call parents once a week, introduce yourself to a person a day.\n\nColumn three is your plays. Now make a playbook. \n\nFinally, now that your playbook is ready, remember this -- you have plenty of fans, including just about everyone in r/stopdrinking. Remember who is in your circle. If your circle is small, go build one. It's not easy, but one by one you can completely change the life you lead. \n\nThe opposite of addiction isn't sobriety, but connectivity. That's why it's not just important to eliminate what's in Column 2, but turn it around into what's in Column 3. You can't just sit there and count the days you have not drank or that will continue to be your only sense of identity. You have to build the new you. It's time to lay the first brick. \n\nIWNDWYT ",

He's been drinking a LOT, and it's always by himself.

He hasn't been going out hardly at all, let alone working or taking care of himself. I called his parents and talked to them about it as I feel like he'd be better off moving back in with them for a while, but I don't really know if that's the right thing or if I should have just let them figure it out on their own.

   "selftext": "I was twenty years old in March of 1998, and life was about to take a serious turn down a road I never played out in my head. The year started off pretty good. Major league baseball teams held tryouts for their farm systems and I was giving it a shot. I don\u2019t know if they still do it, but it was a great experience. I was exercising, eating better, and trying to do the right things, with the fitness knowledge that I had at the time. I drank a little bit socially, but nothing too serious. At that point, my problems hadn\u2019t surfaced yet. My mom was sick. She had pancreatitis from years of alcohol abuse, but overall seemed to be doing okay. I didn\u2019t know anything about the disease except that it was painful and made her miserable. I pretended that her health was fine or though that it was just temporary, because that\u2019s what I did, I took a major life situation and swept it under the rug for later consumption. I didn\u2019t know any better.  \n One of the teams that liked me was the Pirates. They thought enough of me to invite me down to Jupiter, Florida for a second call back. I was supposed to drive down there on March 5th, but plans changed. On the night of the 4th, I went home to gather some things together and I was going to take off in the morning. My mom was a Boxer breeder and had five or six puppies along with four grown dogs at the time, so she was keeping herself busy. When I got there that night, she wasn\u2019t doing so hot, but I had seen this before. She had morphine pump implanted in her body to ease the pain, but also had plenty of medication to do the same. She had quit drinking by then, but looking back, I don\u2019t know if it mattered. I walked into the house and saw her sitting on the floor kind of rocking and crying. I figured that she had taken too much medication again to ease the pain and was out of it because of that. I was pissed. I was leaving the next day to hopefully start a baseball career and didn\u2019t want to leave her alone like that with all those dogs in the house. I had learned how to show that I was pissed off from her. She was the queen. I kept yelling at her looking for some type of response, but all I got was a crying slur, \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t do it!\u201d. There was no way I was going to believe her because it had happened so many times before. It was a one\\-sided argument, and I eventually calmed down. I had asked her a few times if I should call an ambulance, but we never agreed to. So, I brought her upstairs, so she could lie down and sleep it off. I told her that I\u2019d be back in the morning to check on her before I went to Florida. Unfortunately, this was a normal occurrence, so I didn\u2019t think much of it.  \n As I was leaving, I was walking down the stairs and heard, \u201cNeil? Can you please get me some water?\u201d The balls on her, I thought. \u201cF\\*ck you! Get your own water!\u201d I felt bad saying it but thought that I had to show tough love, and \u2018fuck you\u2019 was how we did it in my family. So off I went to spend the night at my girlfriend\u2019s house, I wanted to spend some time with her before I left. She was a great person, and I\u2019m sure still is. She supported me in everything I did. Maybe one day I\u2019ll be brave enough to tell the story of how I screwed that one up, but not today. The next morning, I hopped into my truck and headed home, with my girl by my side, I was feeling excited about the new venture I was about to go on, and even if I didn\u2019t make it, I knew that it would be a great experience. I don\u2019t remember exactly why she was with me when I went back to the house because she wasn\u2019t coming with me to Florida, but either way, she was there.  \n When I got there, I went inside and heard water dripping. I figured that I\u2019d get my stuff and investigate later. I called for my mom, but didn\u2019t she didn\u2019t answer, and I really didn\u2019t think anything of it. I went down to the basement and saw water dripping down on my bed, and all over the floor. I had weird feeling in my gut, so I hurried up and got my stuff together. I went upstairs and saw the water leaking from the ceiling and into the living room. Oh shit. She left the bathtub on all night. This was going to throw a giant wrench in my plans, so I ran up to the second floor to turn the bathtub off. It was weird, the dogs hadn\u2019t come to greet me yet, but they were probably just hanging with mom or the puppies. I glanced in the room and saw my mom before I went to turn the bathtub off. I was trying to have a conversation with her to make sure it was okay that I left, but no there was no response. \u201cMom. What wrong with you? Can\u2019t you hear me?\u201d but still nothing. I turned the water off and went into her room, and something wasn\u2019t right. When the dogs jumped on the bed, she just kinda flowed with it and my heart sank. \u201cMom!\u201d I said so many times. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d She wasn\u2019t moving. I walked over to the bed, picked up her arm, and it was ice cold. She was dead.  \n After a few dozen \u201cOh my God\u2019s\u201d I ran downstairs like a crazy person yelling \u201cshe\u2019s dead\u201d over and over again. I remember seeing at my girlfriend\u2019s face. It was a combination of never ending love and the pain she felt because she knew what happened. Her lips were quivering, and she was shaking, but I just ran away. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I think I blacked out for a minute because I ended up down the street, on my back, and on the ground crying. When she finally had the courage to come get me, I\u2019ll never forget the love mixed with pain in her eyes\u2026 it made it all real. I was noticing someone else\u2019s pain *for me* for the very first time, it was confusing. I stopped crying and sucked it up because, all of a sudden, I felt that I had to be strong for her. It was a way to bury my feelings, and hide my emotions, and I took it.  \n When I finally got some time to myself, after the ambulance took my mom away, a couple things sunk in. My mom was dead, and my last words to her were \u201cf\\*ck you, get your own water.\u201d What? Does that feeling go away? How in the world could those be my last words to my own mother? How am I going to live with that? At the time it was the darkest place that I had ever been. We didn\u2019t always see eye to eye, but by the time she died, the dynamic of our relationship was actually pretty good. We were learning from each other, and we had respect for each other, even though it didn\u2019t show the night before. Or maybe she just respected me more than she had in the past. Either way, it didn\u2019t matter now. She was gone.  \n They did an autopsy, and found that the cause of death was sepsis, which caused the mental confusion that made me think that she had taken too much medication. The other thing is that, if I had called an ambulance the night before, she could have been treated and possibly saved. Take a wild guess where I put those emotions. Right at the bottom of every bottle I saw, *that\u2019s where*. That spring and summer was rough on my mind and my body. I got stupid. I did more stupid shit than I ever imagined possible. Thank God that my girlfriend was who she was because, if it weren\u2019t for her, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve made it through that summer. Or was she enabling me without knowing it?  \n Why am I telling you this story? Because, there are a lot of lessons to be learned from what I went through that year and an awful lot more story to tell\u2026 which is exactly what I\u2019m going to do in part 2 of this article. But for now, just know that I got through it, and even though it took me almost twenty years, I found the tools in myself to come to terms with and accept what happened. This has allowed me to grow as a person, be able to talk about it, and hopefully, pass on those tools to others that may find them beneficial.",

   "selftext": "**As I said, I don't expect you to read it. It's long and doesn't make any sense. I just felt like unloading the baggage that I've been carrying for so many years now. This post doesn't have one theme in particular...it's basically just random things that have been pissing me off, during certain periods of my life**\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've come to the conclusion that I don't want to live anymore. I don't have the motivation to do anything anymore. I just don't want to. I've always hated my family. I hate my friends, my colleagues, and everyone else. Good and genuine people are so rare nowadays it's damn difficult to meet one of those in a lifetime. Everyone else is fake, ignorant and uneducated. Living in a shithole of a country doesn't help much either. People here would do anything to make you feel like shit. Most of them are pretty stupid and stubborn and they think they're always right. Here, in my country, people think that mental illness is a 'choice'. You can just snap out of it whenever you want to, simple as that. 'Happiness is a choice', they say. If you see a psychiatrist, they think you're legitimately insane. They are like sheep. Everything you do 'disrespects god'. Homosexuals should burn in hell 'because the Bible says so'. Those who don't believe in God should also burn in hell 'because the bible says so'. Meanwhile, those religious assholes think they're all holy and pure, when basically, they're the worst kind of people. They're ignorant and uneducated and no matter what happens, it happens because of 'God's will'. Living in a Christian, Orthodox family, taught me that I should avoid this kind of people at all costs.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJust a few days ago, we were discussing a few recent events in my country. There has been a terrible car crash and 9 people died in it. My father was saying, unironically, that they deserved to die because they were 'trash' and they were 'goddamn gypsies who dont deserve to live'. He's said stupid shit like this on other occasions too. Whenever someone brings up the topic of gay people, he would curse them and tell me that if he ever finds out that I'm gay (I'm not) or that I'm hanging out with gay people, he will cut me off completely and never talk to me again. He hates everyone who is different or doesn't agree with his views, and I fucking despise him for that. I can't stand the fact that I have a racist and homophobic father.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOn top of that, my current mental state doesn't allow me to cope with all this bullshit. I'm fed up with everything and everyone. I should be writing my thesis right now but instead, I'm stuck here thinking about how much I hate my country and people, in general. I've been suffering from depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, depersonalization/derealization and OCD (Pure-O) for years and it's getting more and more difficult for me to deal with my environment and with myself. During these years, I've been trying various tratments and pills but nothing ever worked. Also, I've been in therapy for years, sometimes changing therapists in order to see if someone will be able to shed some light on my situation. I know that therapy helps some people but it personally doesn't help me. Seeing that nothing makes me feel better, naturally, I turned to drugs. I've never done hard drugs like heroin, coke or meth, but I sometimes mess around with MDMA, DXM and codeine. I live alone in a 1-room apartment, in a different city, far from my family. But so it happened that one day, my mother visited me and found my stash. I know I should've probably been more careful but at that point, I literally didn't give a fuck about hiding my drugs, since I was the only person living there and I thought that no one would search for anything in my house, as long as I'm there. But anyway, my mother was pissed at me. Knowing her, I sincerely thought she'd smack my face but she was surprisingly calm. She just told me that she didn't want me to be a 'fucking junkie' and that I should stop. Now, here's the thing: I've tried many depression and anxiety meds, tried therapy, tried many diets, excercise, tried yoga and many more...even fucking praying and colon cleansing. I was so depressed that I was basically on the verge of commiting suicide all the time. Drugs saved me at that point. I would have killed myself during those dark times if I didn't have drugs. It never turned into addiction, though. I would always leave at least 1 or 2 weeks of break between dosing. I never took huge quantities of substances and I've never re-dosed in the same day. I never mixed substances with one another and never messed with dangerous combos. I consider myself to be a responsible user and my drug use has never gotten out of hand. However, my parents didn't understand this. They wouldn't understand that using drugs in recreational purposes, every now and then, was not going to harm me. My mother, of course, told my father about it. He went absolutely berserk, yelling at me and cursing, saying that he hates me and that he's ashamed of me. He keeps saying that he hates druggies and that I'm a disappointment. Here, in my country, drug users aren't seen as simply drug USERS. They're seen as ADDICTS. People here don't know the difference between 1) being hopelessly addicted and 2) using a substance in a responsible way, in order to get a desired effect or in order to get a sense of relief from mental or physical pain. Ironically, most people here are smokers and alcoholics. We are one of the leading countries when it comes to alcoholism. My father is - ironically - an alcoholic and a smoker ever since he was 8 years old. He gets drunk every few days and smokes 1 pack of cigarettes a day. My mother keeps telling me that \"drugs are bad\" and that \"I am responsible for my own happiness\" while basically popping Xanax every day (she's also been on Prozac and Anafranil). She thinks that praying is the only solution to a person's torment but doesn't want to admit that the only reason why she hasn't killed herself is because she's on antidepressants (she also doesn't agree that the pills have helped her, and doesn't want to give up on them either). This is basically the mentality of everyone in my area. They smoke 1 or 2 packs of cigarettes a day, they drink like crazy, they're addicted to gambling and poker, they pop Xannies like they're fucking tic tacs, they're addicted to caffeine, they're addicted to sugar, they're addicted to junk food, yet they HATE 'druggies'. I'm so fed up with this and I feel so alone because no one believes that I'm genuinely struggling, they all think I'm just using my mental illness as an excuse to be a recluse, avoid responsibility and do drugs. In reality, I really WISH I could be healthy. I wish I could have a normal life, I wish I could get more involved and be more productive but I just can't find the energy and strength to do so. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI can't live like this anymore. I can't live in a country full of ignorant, uneducated fools but I don't have the financial means to move abroad either. I can't take my family anymore but I depend on them. I can't stand abuse from people, but I can't stand being alone either. I feel trapped and judged. I feel like no one understands or cares about my pain. Sorry for the long post, I'm just so desperate and don't know where to run and what to do...",

   "selftext": "I'll try to make a very long story as short as I can...(warning, wall of text. Mostly me just ranting and trying to look at the BIG picture. But god bless anyone that makes it through it! Have a great day!) \n\n\nI'm almost 50 and have been an alcoholic for 25+ of those years. The last 5 have been progressively worse, were in drinking a 12 pack of high point beer every weekday and double that on any given weekend day. I got fired from my job for drinking at work and my gracious and loving fiance had a good job, and were trying to sell the house but there's some work to do, so she told me not to worry about getting another job until we move and I would fix up the house and get it ready for sale. I had just left a stressful job, and a few month vacation getting the house ready sounded like a nice change. I think the problem started when we didn't have the money to get the materials for about 3 months... Guess what I did for 3 months? Yup, drink, alot. \n\nOnce we started the renovation I got a DUI shortly after that and lost my license.\nAbout a month after that I broke my femur bone (walking home drunk of course, since I could not drive). I was bed ridden for 6 weeks. Guess what I did for 6 weeks... If you've made it this far in my story, you got it.\n\nThe pain, and shear boredom, pushed me to drink even more. I'm not making excuses here, (or am i??) just trying to be real with you, and myself...\nAnyways, being bed rid my muscles atrophied and now I just have no energy or motivation to work out and feel like shit all the time. I stopped eating more than 1 small meal a day, if I force myself to, other wise I have gone 5 days without any food... Besides beer, if that counts. It has calories so that's how I justified it, but I'm seeing now I was just enabling myself... Is that even a thing?! \n\nSo that's the \"short\" version of what brought me to you kind folks. \n\nCURRENTLY: I have developed an extreme anxiety towards heights, to the point i where I can't fly, go above the 2 floor of ANY building and can't drive over bridges...it sucks really bad and I'm sorry for anyone else inflicted with it. I can't sleep at nights because my brain keeps showing me images that causes extreme anxiety, sweaty palms, increased heart rate. Another poster mentioned that when he finally lost his anxiety, he missed it and his brain would trigger something to stress him out so that he would feel \"normal\". Thats messed up, and I feel greatly for that individual. It sounds like a prison, and I fear that's where I'm getting, or already at. \n\nToday sucks. Last night my fiance broke up with me, I found out she already has a new man in her life (in her defense, she's told me this would be coming if I didn't change things, so it's on me, I know this, and I'm trying to accept that.). She has been my soul provider for the last year for beer, cigarettes and weed. Well, and as would be accepted, yeah, she cut me off cold turkey on all that, and I have apparently scarred her for life and she's taking pleasure in this. I'm out of everything that's been my friend for years (alcohol and cigs :( ) I have no family or friends I can count on to help, but I'm pretty sure that's probably due to the drinking too. So, I made my bed and I'm going to have to lay in it. \n\nADDON: I never paid my DUI fine, so I currently have a warrant. I have no driving license or picture ID. And, NOW, since I didn't pay on time, even to get my license back would be almost $3k. I haven't been working your almost a year so I don't have insurance to get detox /rehab. I just drank my (ex) fiance's last 2 beers after she told me yesterday that if I touched them she was calling the cops on me and I can detox the hard way in jail, where they don't a shit what you're going through. \n\n\nTHE END GAME: No idea to be honest. I have an detox assessment in 2 days, but I don't know if that's gonna be enough to prevent her from calling the police on me when she gets home for drinking her beers (and whisky, opps). Either that, or she will just insist I get out, at which point I would, and walk to the ER of the nearest hospital, because I feel terrible. I pray none of you have ever, or will ever be here. I have no way to get out and the stress is causing me to be, apparently, self-destructive. I hate what I have become.\n\nAny input or suggestions are GREATLY appreciated. \n\nAnd anyone that made it to the end, here's a joke to lighten the mood:\n\n\nWhat'd the fish say when he ran into a concrete wall? \n\nDAM! \n\nLove ya all...

   "selftext": "One of the things that made it so easy for me to continue drinking was that I never had any real consequences. I never was in jail for more than a day or so, the bank never threatened to take my house. My jobs were always more than supportive and somehow I still have all my fingers and toes.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t think about the consequences. I could think about them all day long, but if it were in my head that I was gonna drink, there was simply no stopping me. I didn\u2019t resist at all. There was no debate, no trying to convince myself it was the wrong thing to do. I never tried to talk myself out of it. All of that internal yammering was too painful and willpower doesn\u2019t existent when I\u2019m drinking. It was easier to just give in, give up, quit fighting a fight I\u2019ll never win.\n\nEven just the \u201cknowing\u201d that I was going to drink gave me instant relief. Like pouring water over an Alka-Seltzer tablet. That immediate, fizzy, bubbly chemical reaction \u2014 that\u2019s the uplifting, scientific relief I felt whenever I gave in to alcoholism.\n\nA counselor told me once that I should \u201cplay the tape all the way through,\u201d meaning that before I started drinking to stop and think about what would happen from start to finish.\n\nErm. That\u2019s not how alcoholics do. We don\u2019t have forethought before drinking or willpower when drinking. Consequences are irrelevant. We only see the next drink and never the dominoes falling down afterward.\n\nSeriously, when it comes to drinking my thought process is this: I\u2019m gonna get drunk and I don\u2019t care what happens. My house burns down? Good, now I won\u2019t have to pay the mortgage and will have one less responsibility. That may sound ludicrous but that\u2019s the kind of disconnect I\u2019m talking about here.\n\nYeah, life could taunt me with blackouts, jails, whatever but none of it mattered once the drink was on or even the decision to drink was made. I was at peace and nothing could touch me.\n\n\u2026\n\nAnd then there was that one time I walked into the liquor store door. Like I walked up to and in to the door. And then bounced backward off the glass because it was the exit and it automatically opened for people leaving. I\u2019d like to say that it was a simple mistake but really I was pretty much lit from head to toe.\n\nThe whole door wobbled and complained during our encounter. I\u2019d also like to say that I was filled with shame but any embarrassment was muffled by my drunkenness. Because drunkenness is like a wet blanket over the fire, a soggy forcefield that keeps the inferno of reality from being real.\n\nSo after solving the automatic door riddle and making it inside, two cashiers and a customer were staring at me with slight alarm. I ignored their stares and made straight for my aisle, as fast as I could while maintaining my composure and balance. Only momentum kept me walking in a semi-straight line.\n\nAnd then back at the checkout aisle one cashier was still around. He was an older, taller guy wearing concern on his face. Like he wanted to say something, to ask me if I was okay because I obviously wasn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t fit to be walking let alone driving.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t say anything. I\u2019m sure it was because working in a liquor store he\u2019d seen the likes of my kind before and learned the last thing you wanna do is confront an alcoholic when they\u2019re drunk and after more. That\u2019s like poking a bear after his honey.\n\nI don\u2019t remember what I bought from the liquor store that day, only that I made an ass out of myself and was too drunk to know it.\n\nAnyways, see: no consequences. I have a grab bag full of stories just like this were there weren\u2019t any consequences for my actions. Almost always nothing happened other than I got drunk. I was rarely even scolded.\n\n\u2026\n\nBut wait. There were consequences even if I didn\u2019t think about them. Even if alcoholism kept me out of touch with them.\n\nThere was the perpetual guilt so harsh that I would cringe, close my eyes, and hang my head. Soaked in regret for the constant humiliation I handed out to my ex-wife and then following it up with gift-wrapped sorries and promises that I\u2019d do better.\n\nI tried to be a good person when I was sober, had all the right moral and so on, but drinking drowned them all. Suffocated every shred of decency. I\u2019d be doing and say things I would never do sober. After five or so drinks I would be uncontrollably careless. I\u2019m an alcoholic so I\u2019d have twice that and then the real fun would kick in. I\u2019d say things to people that I didn\u2019t mean, completely smashed, flirting with other women, right in front of my ex-wife. Passing out at a friend\u2019s party at 8pm because my party had started at 8am.\n\nThen I\u2019d wake up plumb full of shame, anxiety through the roof. Should I say something to that dude? Do I owe that girl an apology? Most of the time I wouldn\u2019t say anything at all with the hope that they\u2019d just forget. Bu you commit enough crimes and people stop forgetting, shit stops blowing over. People start looking at you differently.\n\nAnd then I\u2019d start drinking all over again as soon as I could and it was like magic. All the guilt and shame would be washed down the drain like dirty bathwater. Alcoholics have mastered tuning out the guilt when we\u2019re turning the drunk dial to 11.\n\n\u2026\n\nI drank to get drunk from the time I was 15. The last few years I did try really, really hard, though, to keep myself in check, to keep myself from doing stupid shit. But that never happened. I\u2019d stumble around the house, fall into shit, make jokes that weren\u2019t funny. I absolutely hated feeling embarrassed the next morning. All I wanted was to drink, feel that drunken serenity and not make an ass of myself. Lubricated but not falling over if you will.\n\nThat\u2019s not something I can do though. My drinking always led me to a black hole I couldn\u2019t pull myself out of.\n\nAnd there was that piper to be paid.\n\n[Read the rest](https://tcrbang.com/?HgU) \ud83e\udd15",

   "selftext": "Staying sober has gotten progressively easier for me, though not without its moments of doubt and whispering whatifs.\n\nWhat has taken be almost 2.5 years to work out is that staying sober hasn't been the same thing as addressing some of the underlying issues that contributed to my alcoholism. \n\nI've realised this after my wife and I had a child \\(1.5 years old now\\), and the common issue of underlying tensions being brought to the surface by mundanity of exhaustion, frayed nerves etc when raising a child.  \n\n\nI've had more personal growth I feel in the last year than I've had in the preceding 2.5 years of sobriety. A lot of this was basically me confronting issues of self\\-doubt, pride, insecurity at the coalface, and having to deal with it there and then.  \n\n\nNot sure if this is going to help anyone, but the key takeaway from my sobriety, for me, really, is that it continues to be an ongoing process.",

   "selftext": "After a blackout binge on Friday, where I did some pretty shameful things and possibly lost a good friendship, I admitted to myself that I've lost control of my drinking.\n\nI've been a high functioning alcohol (ab)user for years. Usually binging 2-3 days a week (3-5 strong drinks). Other than a beer belly and lots of hangovers, I never noticed much of a problem. After the 2016 election, my drinking picked up to 3-4 days a week, but then in April of 2017 I started a new office job and reduced my drinking to 1-2 days on the weekend. In January I moved to a neighborhood that didn't have a bar scene and was really busy with work so I had maybe one or two drink the whole month, and didn't notice any withdrawal. In February I lost my job, so I went to Mardi Gras with a bunch of friends and binged for about a week. After Mardi Gras, I cut back to 3-5 drinks a week until April when I came back to my hometown where the dominant social activity is binge drinking, so about 3-4 nights a week I've been having 3-5 strong drinks. Last week, I drank at least 3-5 drinks every day including one night of 6-8 and Friday, when I blacked out, I probably had close to 20 drinks.\n\nFriday was my last drink. I didn't think I was physically dependent at all since I'm so \"high functioning\" and limit my drinking to socially appropriate hours and settings, but by Monday afternoon I was extremely irritable, had a racing heartbeat and felt like I was having a panic attack. I went to the hospital and they gave me 1mg of Ativan and sent me home recommending a detox facility \"if I felt like I needed it\". I went to the detox facility and they said I could stay there but there was nothing they could do for me since I wasn't presenting any symptoms and had no alcohol in my blood. So I went home. I felt a little bit anxious in the evening but nothing terrible. When I woke up this morning I felt great! Better than I've felt in a long time. But by the afternoon I felt anxious and irritable. I went for a run which helped, and then took 250mg of magnesium which made me really tired. By the evening (now-ish) my stomach is feeling really tight from anxiety and I had a brief moment of panic. It's been ~90 hours since my last drink.\n\nIf it's just anxiety as a result of not drinking, ok. But I've never experienced trying to quit and having any withdrawal symptoms before, so I don't know what to expect. Is withdrawal still potentially dangerous at this point? Will the anxiety increase or decrease over the next few weeks? Are there any medical steps I need to be taking?",

I'm overweight and feel shitty pretty much all the time, aside from time I'm drinking.\n\nThe weird thing is, I'm a pretty good drunk.  I find it easy to stop at 4-5 drinks a night and rarely exceed it.  I don't drive, I don't get in fights, I'm in a good mood.  When I'm sober, I'm anxious, cranky, rude, etc.  To quit drinking almost feels like smothering my most pleasant self.  But I feel I need a change.  I can feel my health starting to suffer.  Problem is, I'm a night drinker.  By the time the clock rings 9, I've had a day of misery and all my will-power is sapped.

   "selftext": "Hello! \nUnfortunately, we've been through many addiction problems with members or our family, this one is the worst thus far. My cousin is nearly 40 years old with two school aged children. She's battled alcoholism and other things throughout the years and has quite a hefty track record with the policy. Our family is pretty dysfunctional and defaults to the \"if we don't talk about it, it doesn't exist\" method. At this point, my cousin is rail thin, rotted teeth and extremely delusional. She believes \"they\" are tracking her and has become quite reckless. We all believe she is in danger to herself and others. She's already been through the system and our grandmother has asked us not to involve the police. They are located in Central California and I am on the other side of the country. We don't know what to do or where to reach out to for help. I think that if we don't do anything, she'll end up in jail, which may not be a bad thing. I know we'd all like to see her get better though. This current decline has happened rapidly, and I know it's a matter of time before she does something really crazy. (Crazier than she's already done.) \nAt this time, she doesn't have the kids and she's not allowed at my Grandmother's house. All of us are at an impasse on what we should be doing. \nDo any of y'all have any resources of places we can contact in California to see what our options are? \n\nThank you!!",

   "selftext": "I hope I don't get too rambling and long, I'll try and keep it short enough. I just want to get my story off my chest and let go so I can move forward. I want to forgive myself and I'm feeling so much shame and embarrassment right now.  \n  \nI have been drinking all of my adult life. I started at around 15 with my boyfriend who could get alcohol from his older friends. We drank on and off socially and on weekends together. I eventually graduated and moved to college, rooming in the dorm with my best friend. I chose what college I went to based on the fact that the boyfriend (a year older than me) had gone there. Best friend and I had a difficult time making friends and therefore stayed in our room and drank constantly. Thus began my foray into serious alcoholism. I missed a number of classes and was getting even more depressed than I had been. I had a number of issues, including some sexual abuse from a boyfriend at 14. I had turned all my hate inward and was self harming pretty frequently.  \n  \nSix months into college I overdosed on Tylenol and went to bed. The next morning I was vomiting what felt like pure acid. I called my parents who asked my roommate to take me to the hospital. I was in the ED and the nurse who took care of me was condescending and even after giving me the antidote nonchalantly said \"Well, you could still die from this.\" I was hospitalized overnight and my parents came and took me the 2 hours back home. I withdrew from school. I never was hospitalized inpatient for my suicide attempt.  \n  \nWhen I got back home I spent the next few years doing just over minimum wage jobs and feeling sorry for myself. Depression was at a critical level and I contemplated suicide a lot. I gained a ridiculous amount of weight and ended up over 300 pounds. At 5'5 I felt like an elephant. I hid my alcoholism from everyone. Drank in my room alone.  \n  \nDuring this time I met some people on Craiglist, met a number of guys online. I was manipulative and a terrible person for a while. I broke a number of hearts and had my heart broken a number of times. All of it boiled down to my self hatred. I took it out on everyone else, especially when I was drunk.  \n  \nEventually, I realized I had to do something about my weight. I had not been able to be compliant with a diet and my parents were supportive so I got a weight loss surgery. As I started to lose weight, I gained confidence. But what I didn't realize is that because of the smaller stomach, alcohol now hit me faster and harder. I spent a decent time sober, met a guy who was great, and lost a bunch of weight. Until I decided I was ok to drink again.  \n  \nThe next few years were marred with alcoholism. The guy stayed with me and supported me through it all. All the nights that I drank so much that I puked and then drank more. When I quit my job in a hangover panic. When I came home from work sobbing every day because of depression and anxiety and then turned to the booze again. I became a verbally abuse drunk. I have always been empathetic, which was great when sober because I could really help people, but terrible while drunk because I could really dig hard at people. I have always known what buttons to push and for some reason I am very articulate when drunk. I also blacked out constantly. I'd have no memory of how bad I treated people.  \n  \nI ended up getting sober for a year. I was sick and tired of it all. I thought I was at rock bottom. He and I moved away from my hometown, I got a new job I enjoyed and things were great. But we were not great. In this time we had grown apart, or I had grown apart. We became more like roommates than lovers. Best friends but not in love. At least, I wasn't in love. I started drinking again.  \n  \nI met another man, who I had known for a long time. I regret this to this day, but we had an affair. I never told my guy, but I left him because I didn't think it was right and I felt such tremendous guilt. He was such a good man and I was so wrong. I started drinking very heavily again after leaving due to the guilt and shame.  \n  \nI have hit rock bottom now. I am still with the man I had an affair with and he is a wonderful guy too. Supports me through everything. Lets me live with him. Forgives me for black out making drunk decisions that are awful. I spiraled to the point where I drove drunk, something I promised myself I'd never do. I bought little wine bottles and would drink them when I got 5 minutes from the house so that I could hide my drinking. He knew me enough to realize.  \n  \nOver the weekend I embarrassed myself in front of his family and his sister's family. I then proceeded to get mad at myself, sit in the bedroom and punch my legs. I woke up hungover, painful and depressed. I have little money due to compulsively shopping while drunk. Am in a stupid amount of debt at the moment. But I started sober yesterday.  \n  \nThis got way too long, but the point of it is, I am not that person anymore. I am my sober self. I have done it before and I can do it again. I have been hiding in my room due to shame (We live with his family atm because I need to pay off debt and save money). He spent all day yesterday with me making sure I was ok. He watched over me while I slept last night because I was having bad dreams. I told him to tell his family about my alcoholism and to apologize for me. He did and said they seem ok with it. They are not very formal and conservative as my family.  \n  \nI'm still ashamed. Not sure if I'm leaving the bedroom today. But I am sober. I have a job where I can eventually pay off my debt. I have a guy that I adore and that loves me enough to help me get through this. I will not ruin it this time. I will not hurt anyone else. I will not hurt myself. I will get through this journey to self love and forever sobriety. I am myself today.  \n  \nIWNDWYT  \n  \nIf you made it through my story, thank you. I appreciate the listening ear and shoulder to lean on.  ",

   "selftext": "Let me ask you a question. Why do you drink? Is it because drinking makes you full of life and outgoing? Maybe you love the way it makes you feel about yourself, or how it tastes, or smells. Could it be because it makes your life better than you ever imagined it could be? No. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. If that\u2019s the case, then why are you trying to get sober? You\u2019re trying to get sober because alcohol has messed you up. You feel bad about yourself. You can\u2019t stand how you feel when you drink. You hate the taste. You hate the smell. You hate looking at it. You want it out of your life, but you don\u2019t know how to do it. Does that sound like you have a love for alcohol?\n\nYour conscious mind knows that alcohol is bad for you, but you keep dumping it on to quiet it. What you\u2019re really trying to do is to quiet your subconscious mind because it has all of those problems that you told it to store, and now it\u2019s getting full. The bad part is that your subconscious mind is a lot smarter than you are, I\u2019m talking about *you* as your conscious or thinking mind. You think that you\u2019re behind the wheel but couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Your subconscious brain is telling you and your body that there is a problem in the form of anxiety or at this point, even cravings. It doesn\u2019t crave alcohol at all, it needs to let out all the shit you told it to bury. At some point it wanted to release some of the feelings or emotions that were building, but you weren\u2019t ready, so you drank. Just this once, no big deal. You put it off for a while, and when it wanted to come out again, you drank. You did this over and over until your body could not live without alcohol. Now you feel like you *have to drink* just to get through the day or certain situations in life. When the hell did this happen? Your mind and body have become so anxious that the thought of not having a drink scares you into a panic. You start shaking and realize that you\u2019re not the one controlling your body anymore. Your subconscious mind is now controlling your body but the only thing you\u2019ve fed it was sadness, depression, bad advice, and alcohol. You have not dealt with your issues for so long, that the subconscious mind can no longer store them, and your thinking mind is not equipped to handle all of the things you were storing. Another drink? You don\u2019t need to focus on your drinking problem to fix it. You already hate the way you feel when you drink. We went over this a few sentences ago. Drinking has already made you feel like your life is ruined. You don\u2019t want to drink, that\u2019s why you\u2019re in recovery. No, you don\u2019t have a drinking problem. You have a *YOU* problem. That\u2019s what needs to be fixed. You.\n\nAt some point, when you\u2019re ready, you will have to take the time to take care of what owns you, because you sure as shit don\u2019t own IT anymore. This thing that controls you is the monster that you built. You created this by not dealing with things as they came. And guess what. It\u2019s probably not your fault. Somewhere along the line, you weren\u2019t taught the life skills you needed to deal with the smallest of problems, so you had no idea how to deal with the biggest of problems. Don\u2019t beat yourself up! The same thing happened to me. This is our weird existence and it\u2019s amazing when we start to take action by looking into ourselves because we have a conscious mind. Sometimes we just have to clean out the attic. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you. Nothing that can\u2019t be fixed. You\u2019re a human being that used the wrong medication because you feared some of life\u2019s problems. You may have been a toddler when you learned how to bottle something up that scared you or made you angry.  \n Put your hand on your heart. Do you feel it beating? That\u2019s not you that is making it beat. It\u2019s your subconscious mind that\u2019s controlling all of the functions of your body, including your nervous system, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it. The problem is that you aren\u2019t willing to let out all of the bullshit you\u2019ve put in there for the past however many years because you\u2019re scared and anxious. But your subconscious mind doesn\u2019t know what to do with all of the problems that you stored in it, so it can\u2019t function properly which means it\u2019s not controlling your body the way it\u2019s supposed to. Now you\u2019re sick. Now you\u2019re worried even more because you\u2019re sick. Do you see the cycle? Why would you focus on the act of not drinking if you already hate drinking? That\u2019s going to amp up your anxiety to 100 and make recovery nearly impossible. Any good psychologist will tell you the same exact thing. Don\u2019t believe me? Great! Ask one, or hand this to a hundred psychologists \\(for objectivity\\) and see what they say. \n\nThe first thing to know is that you\u2019re going to be okay. You must trust that you\u2019re going to get through all of this because not trusting it will make it much more difficult. The second thing is, to do whatever you can to let out the things that are stored in a healthy manner. Exercise, mediation, learning about what makes you a healthy human, and even meetings or a simple but deep conversation with a friend. Here\u2019s where I think AA is fine, but only for a short period of time. When or if you go, really try to listen to the pain that alcohol has caused people. Listen to all the mistakes people have made and all the damage that they\u2019ve done to their lives. Be compassionate and feel their pain because they\u2019re about to feel yours. I would encourage you to speak so you can hear yourself telling a story that you wouldn\u2019t normally tell. Do this with people you trust as well, it will help put things into perspective. Remember that these people at meeting are strangers, and that they\u2019re going through the same thing, so don\u2019t be shy about your story. Make it count when you go because you don\u2019t want to be the guy or girl that hangs around for fifteen years and comes because they\u2019re addicted to meetings instead of alcohol. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that person per say, but I\u2019m willing to bet that you didn\u2019t have that on your list of *what I want to be when I grow up*. So make this temporary. Being addicted to meetings can be hard on the mind. Here you are, barely able to deal with your own problems and you want to live in the problems of others? No, you don\u2019t. Use AA as a reality check from time to time. As the saying goes, everything in moderation. People want *you* to be miserable with *them*, so try not to make this your anchor. It\u2019s a strange part of human nature. Meetings should be used as a tool to help you feel again, not as a lifetime anchor that never lets you leave. \n\nYou might not believe it, but you\u2019ve been burying feelings, and holding them down for so long that your emotions will either hide or come out in an excessive and unhealthy way. Neither one is normal. It\u2019s science! Hiding what you\u2019re feeling will work against you 100&amp;#37; of the time, because you don\u2019t give yourself the ability to deal with what\u2019s bothering you. There are healthy ways to have emotions, and getting angry, or covering them up by getting drunk are not the way to do it. I cried, and I also laughed at random times while I was meditating. I was able to let myself just be and not wrestle with the oncoming emotions. I just let them out as they wanted to come. Don\u2019t judge yourself and don\u2019t wrestle with your sadness or fears, it\u2019s not helping. I gave my emotions zero resistance and just let them flow without judging any of them. I didn\u2019t know exactly where they came from all the time, but it didn\u2019t matter, I was just letting go. Each time I did this it felt like 100 pounds were lifted off my shoulders and the only thing I did was just let it go. Don\u2019t just concentrate on the stupid things you did while you were drinking, but instead let yourself feel how scared you were when you decided to quit, then work backwards from there. Each time a memory pops up, don\u2019t try to fix it or wrestle with it, just let it do it\u2019s thing and if you get scared, that means that you\u2019re on the right track. You\u2019re only scared because you didn\u2019t let yourself be afraid before, your body is learning how to deal with it. Don\u2019t worry, *you\u2019re safe as long as you\u2019re not drinking.* Surround yourself with people that truly love you. Sometimes you may find out that someone you thought loved you, really doesn\u2019t. Sometimes people want us around because our problems make their problems seem smaller, thus your pain made them feel better about their own lives. These people will tell you things that actually* go aga*inst recovery, just so you don\u2019t pass them up in the happy department. They will use your pain, suffering, and bad decisions as an anchor for their own ways of dealing with their own problems. Those people need to either support what you\u2019re doing, or they have to go. You\u2019re trying to get healthy! You\u2019re not trying to make a healthy person feel better about themselves. These will be the same people that call alcoholism a disease but are against treating it with medicine. \n\nSpeaking of medicine, if your doctor prescribes pills like Xanax or Klonopin, it\u2019s time to find a new doctor. Benzodiazepines are ALCOHOL IN PILL FORM and will mess you up like never before. I was prescribed these medications when I first got sober for three years, and when I tried to quit using them, I had seizures. Again\u2026 not normal. That is your body literally kicking and screaming telling *you* that what *you* are putting in *your* body is BAD, and it doesn\u2019t want it. But that\u2019s just science talking, not me. Look it up. Thousands of studies have been done on better medications, and most of the ones that work without harmful side effects come from the ground. They are always natural and healthy ways to help you recover quickly and safely, and they\u2019re becoming more available \\(or legal\\) every day. Bill Wilson, the founder of AA, used LSD and psilocybin mushrooms to help him recover from alcohol. Why don\u2019t people know this? Probably because there\u2019s not much money in it. It\u2019s not a ridiculous conspiracy theory, it\u2019s just a fact of life that you can either change or accept. It\u2019s 100&amp;#37; up to you. Just like your life and what you do with it.\n\nDon\u2019t listen to me, listen to yourself and google what\u2019s healthy and makes you feel good. Become a vegetarian or a vegan. Go the other way and get on the carnivore diet or a ketogenic diet. News flash: It\u2019s up to you to do what makes your body feel good. A year after I stopped drinking, I finally ended up doing a keto diet and cutting out sugar and processed carbohydrates because alcohol also processes as sugar, so I didn\u2019t want my body to operate like that anymore \\(science\\). I wanted my body to burn off the stressed fat and function properly. Would you like to know what happened? Great! I\u2019ll tell you. I lost over 50 lbs. in a little over four months and my body stopped craving alcohol because I\u2019m burning fat instead of sugar. There was no need to crave it anymore because my body was functioning properly. I even wrote a book about it because it works so well. Diet plays a huge role in recovery, so find one that\u2019s right for you. The placebo effect of changing your diet alone is healthy. Do you want to struggle with alcohol or would you rather be more concerned about how to be healthy and how to live longer? Now your focusing less on not drinking and more on life and how to live. There will no doubt be people that disagree with what I\u2019m saying, and that\u2019s fine. You can do your own research and find out that I\u2019m making sense.\n\nThis got a little long, so I\u2019ll end it here for now. Just know that there are plenty of ways to recover and it doesn\u2019t take a lifetime to do it. Thanks! Have a POWERFUL day! ",

Somewhere along the line, you weren\u2019t taught the life skills you needed to deal with the smallest of problems, so you had no idea how to deal with the biggest of problems. Don\u2019t beat yourself up! The same thing happened to me. This is our weird existence and it\u2019s amazing when we start to take action by looking into ourselves because we have a conscious mind. Sometimes we just have to clean out the attic. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you. Nothing that can\u2019t be fixed. You\u2019re a human being that used the wrong medication because you feared some of life\u2019s problems. You may have been a toddler when you learned how to bottle something up that scared you or made you angry.  \n Put your hand on your heart. Do you feel it beating? That\u2019s not you that is making it beat. It\u2019s your subconscious mind that\u2019s controlling all of the functions of your body, including your nervous system, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it. The problem is that you aren\u2019t willing to let out all of the bullshit you\u2019ve put in there for the past however many years because you\u2019re scared and anxious. But your subconscious mind doesn\u2019t know what to do with all of the problems that you stored in it, so it can\u2019t function properly which means it\u2019s not controlling your body the way it\u2019s supposed to. Now you\u2019re sick. Now you\u2019re worried even more because you\u2019re sick. Do you see the cycle? Why would you focus on the act of not drinking if you already hate drinking? That\u2019s going to amp up your anxiety to 100 and make recovery nearly impossible. Any good psychologist will tell you the same exact thing. Don\u2019t believe me? Great! Ask one, or hand this to a hundred psychologists \\(for objectivity\\) and see what they say. \n\nThe first thing to know is that you\u2019re going to be okay. You must trust that you\u2019re going to get through all of this because not trusting it will make it much more difficult. The second thing is, to do whatever you can to let out the things that are stored in a healthy manner. Exercise, mediation, learning about what makes you a healthy human, and even meetings or a simple but deep conversation with a friend. Here\u2019s where I think AA is fine, but only for a short period of time. When or if you go, really try to listen to the pain that alcohol has caused people. Listen to all the mistakes people have made and all the damage that they\u2019ve done to their lives. Be compassionate and feel their pain because they\u2019re about to feel yours. I would encourage you to speak so you can hear yourself telling a story that you wouldn\u2019t normally tell. Do this with people you trust as well, it will help put things into perspective. Remember that these people at meeting are strangers, and that they\u2019re going through the same thing, so don\u2019t be shy about your story. Make it count when you go because you don\u2019t want to be the guy or girl that hangs around for fifteen years and comes because they\u2019re addicted to meetings instead of alcohol. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that person per say, but I\u2019m willing to bet that you didn\u2019t have that on your list of *what I want to be when I grow up*. So make this temporary. Being addicted to meetings can be hard on the mind. Here you are, barely able to deal with your own problems and you want to live in the problems of others? No, you don\u2019t. Use AA as a reality check from time to time. As the saying goes, everything in moderation. People want *you* to be miserable with *them*, so try not to make this your anchor. It\u2019s a strange part of human nature. Meetings should be used as a tool to help you feel again, not as a lifetime anchor that never lets you leave. \n\nYou might not believe it, but you\u2019ve been burying feelings, and holding them down for so long that your emotions will either hide or come out in an excessive and unhealthy way. Neither one is normal. It\u2019s science! Hiding what you\u2019re feeling will work against you 100&amp;#37; of the time, because you don\u2019t give yourself the ability to deal with what\u2019s bothering you. There are healthy ways to have emotions, and getting angry, or covering them up by getting drunk are not the way to do it. I cried, and I also laughed at random times while I was meditating. I was able to let myself just be and not wrestle with the oncoming emotions. I just let them out as they wanted to come. Don\u2019t judge yourself and don\u2019t wrestle with your sadness or fears, it\u2019s not helping. I gave my emotions zero resistance and just let them flow without judging any of them. I didn\u2019t know exactly where they came from all the time, but it didn\u2019t matter, I was just letting go. Each time I did this it felt like 100 pounds were lifted off my shoulders and the only thing I did was just let it go. Don\u2019t just concentrate on the stupid things you did while you were drinking, but instead let yourself feel how scared you were when you decided to quit, then work backwards from there. Each time a memory pops up, don\u2019t try to fix it or wrestle with it, just let it do it\u2019s thing and if you get scared, that means that you\u2019re on the right track. You\u2019re only scared because you didn\u2019t let yourself be afraid before, your body is learning how to deal with it. Don\u2019t worry, *you\u2019re safe as long as you\u2019re not drinking.* Surround yourself with people that truly love you. Sometimes you may find out that someone you thought loved you, really doesn\u2019t. Sometimes people want us around because our problems make their problems seem smaller, thus your pain made them feel better about their own lives. These people will tell you things that actually* go aga*inst recovery, just so you don\u2019t pass them up in the happy department. They will use your pain, suffering, and bad decisions as an anchor for their own ways of dealing with their own problems. Those people need to either support what you\u2019re doing, or they have to go. You\u2019re trying to get healthy! You\u2019re not trying to make a healthy person feel better about themselves. These will be the same people that call alcoholism a disease but are against treating it with medicine. \n\nSpeaking of medicine, if your doctor prescribes pills like Xanax or Klonopin, it\u2019s time to find a new doctor. Benzodiazepines are ALCOHOL IN PILL FORM and will mess you up like never before. I was prescribed these medications when I first got sober for three years, and when I tried to quit using them, I had seizures. Again\u2026 not normal. That is your body literally kicking and screaming telling *you* that what *you* are putting in *your* body is BAD, and it doesn\u2019t want it. But that\u2019s just science talking, not me. Look it up. Thousands of studies have been done on better medications, and most of the ones that work without harmful side effects come from the ground. They are always natural and healthy ways to help you recover quickly and safely, and they\u2019re becoming more available \\(or legal\\) every day. Bill Wilson, the founder of AA, used LSD and psilocybin mushrooms to help him recover from alcohol. Why don\u2019t people know this? Probably because there\u2019s not much money in it. It\u2019s not a ridiculous conspiracy theory, it\u2019s just a fact of life that you can either change or accept. It\u2019s 100&amp;#37; up to you. Just like your life and what you do with it.\n\nDon\u2019t listen to me, listen to yourself and google what\u2019s healthy and makes you feel good. Become a vegetarian or a vegan. Go the other way and get on the carnivore diet or a ketogenic diet. News flash: It\u2019s up to you to do what makes your body feel good. A year after I stopped drinking, I finally ended up doing a keto diet and cutting out sugar and processed carbohydrates because alcohol also processes as sugar, so I didn\u2019t want my body to operate like that anymore \\(science\\). I wanted my body to burn off the stressed fat and function properly. Would you like to know what happened? Great! I\u2019ll tell you. I lost over 50 lbs. in a little over four months and my body stopped craving alcohol because I\u2019m burning fat instead of sugar. There was no need to crave it anymore because my body was functioning properly. I even wrote a book about it because it works so well. Diet plays a huge role in recovery, so find one that\u2019s right for you. The placebo effect of changing your diet alone is healthy. Do you want to struggle with alcohol or would you rather be more concerned about how to be healthy and how to live longer? Now your focusing less on not drinking and more on life and how to live. There will no doubt be people that disagree with what I\u2019m saying, and that\u2019s fine. You can do your own research and find out that I\u2019m making sense.\n\nThis got a little long, so I\u2019ll end it here for now. Just know that there are plenty of ways to recover and it doesn\u2019t take a lifetime to do it. Thanks! Have a POWERFUL day! ",

   "selftext": "I gave up drinking 6 days ago. \n\nQuick info on me: M24, wife, two kids (3 &amp; 4).\n\nI'm not sure if I would have been considered an alcoholic, but I would drink 3-4 beers almost every day for the past few years. Didn't ever get drunk unless I pounded them. I read mixed things online about it. I figured I would be better off mentally if I considered myself an alcoholic..the thing I never wanted to be.\n\nI've been struggling with really bad acid reflux for a few years now. That is magically gone. I haven't taken any Tums in 6 days.\n\nI used to have BMs like 5 times a day. Now its only 1 or 2.\n\nI quit drinking the other night because I had some realization after I finished my 4th tall boy that there was no reason for me to be drinking. I kept asking myself why I felt the need. \n\nI also take depression medication which specifically says on the back to \"not drink any alcohol.\" So I don't even think my medication has been working correctly.\n\nAlcoholism is pretty bad in my family. My dad broke that cycle though. His dad actually drank himself to death.\n\nWhy did I drink? Well stress probably. I liked the way it made me feel numb to the world after coming home from work. It is a lot more fun to play video games while drinking. \n\nI thought about trying to \"wean myself off\" but I figured that I wouldn't be able to follow through with that. \n\nI've been dealing with the boredom by doing homework before its due rather than doing it last minute..which feels awesome. I have been trying to spend more quality time with my wife and kids as well. \n\nSparkling water has also helped me a lot.\n\nAm I done with alcohol completely? Probably not. But I will be for a long time. At least until I know I have enough self control to only get one IPA at the bar every once in a while. I plan for a minimum of 6 months, but I honestly don't really have a minimum. I just want to see how it affects my body and get out of the habit of drinking so much. I really do enjoy a good IPA, but I figure there are more important things in life to worry about than beer.\n\nI'm going to get my brother to stop drinking as well. I told him about it already, but he is in Ireland at the moment with his wife so I told him to go ahead and enjoy himself while he is there.\n\nI just wanted to say thank you to this subreddit for giving me enough reasons to stop drinking. I honestly probably wouldn't have done it without you guys. Reddit has been my go to now for a few years for ANY question or problem I have. I like seeing real people's responses to real life issues.\n\nThanks again, guys/gals. I appreciate you all.",

   "selftext": "Hey sobernauts.\n\nI posted here about a week back, just after finishing my last binge. I want to start off by humbly offering my thanks to everyone who reached out. This sub has been amazing, and I look forward to visiting every day. Anyways, here are some of my reflections this wonderful, sober period.\n\nThe first time I quit was back in August 2017. I was presented with an ultimatum by my girlfriend: either I stop drinking, or she leaves. Pretty straightforward, right? And it was, for about seven or eight months, albeit with white\\-knuckled grit. I started it out with an AA\\-meeting, but then never returned for a second \\(red flag, anyone?\\). It wasn't that I didn't enjoy it, but I figured I didn't need any help. If I decided to do this, then I would do it. No AA, no SD, no rehab, no shrink, no support whatsoever. Then after a while, something magical \\(i.e. defying all logic or reason\\) happened.\n\nI suddenly thought, 'Well shit... I'm not an alcoholic, am I? I can control myself *now,* right?', and for some reason and in spite of all empirical evidence pointing the other way, I imbibed that lie. Then, the worst possible thing occurred the first time I had a drink again... I actually **didn't** get blackout drunk. That confirmed the illusion; I was *back,* baby! I rationalized that it had only been my depression\\-period that had caused me to drink. It had been because I was in disarray, and because I had been anxious and in bad shape. I saw that all these aspects of my life were improving now, so I could obviously drink again! I never stopped to think, thoroughly, about *why* life was improving... but deep down, I did know. Somewhere, submerged in endless layers of ego, arrogance, self\\-deceit and selfishness, I did hear that muffled voice.\n\nAnd I disregarded it completely.\n\nAs you can imagine, it went downhill from there. Now, my girlfriend might leave me after my terrible binge at a bachelor's party in Poland... and I wouldn't blame her for a second. Again I had it proven to me that when I drink, I erode the building blocks of my life. Inevitably, pieces of this structure must crumble and collapse under the pressure. Inevitably, I must lose part of who I am sober to accommodate who I am drunk.\n\nI was, in other words, bitch\\-smacked by reality. I was hungover for almost a weak, and in an emotional and spiritual crisis. There was this terrible dissonance between who I wanted to be, and who the demon of alcohol turned me into when I drank. Gradually but undeniably, drunk\\-me has become more brazen, more aggressive, more manipulative and, in general, more of a contemptible sonofabitch. It's a well\\-documented and familiar pattern for many alcoholics I've spoken to; like drunk you gets more comfortable in your skin... like everything becomes more and more about *him* \\(or her\\). It almost seemed like this alter ego was doing everything in his power to destroy my life, and destroy all the things I had worked so hard for... and I was letting him. But I refused to let that happen, and resolved, through tears of anguish and remorse, to quit. Again.\n\nThen I ran, or rather fled, to the first AA\\-meeting I could attend. Then I went to another one the next day... and then the day after that. This time around, it felt like I was coming home... like I had found a bastion of strength. Some of the members remembered me from last time and smiled, 'It's always so wonderful when people come back.' That was it. No judgement, no shame, no condemnation. Just genuine relief that the prodigal son \\(and sadly, there are many of us\\) had returned. And I finally realized... I'm actually powerless. I have *actually* lost control of my life. I can never hit harder than my alcoholism, and so I have to hit better. I need to be tactical. I need to surround myself with people and resources that can remind me what terrible course I would be set upon if I had that first drink. Something clicked in me, like my life flashed before my eyes. I resonated with every story, every shared regret, every signal of hope. I'm only 24, and I've never  broken the law or been in jail \\(which is just pure luck\\)... but I've done some things that the shame of which nearly ate me alive. The pain and regret that permeated these stories is what struck a familiar cord with me, and so I could relate. It almost didn't matter what they'd done, because I knew that if I continued to drink, I would always stoop to a new low. And then I realized something else...\n\nThe person I am when sober has ambitions and desires. I want to be a good man, I want to be a father, I want to be a person people can trust and be safe around. But I am also terribly insecure, self\\-loathing, hard on myself, constantly full of shame and extremely anxious. This, coupled with a huge pride, arrogance and bloated ego make for an ungodly synergy I call 'fuck\\-you\\-and\\-your\\-self\\-insight'ness. It has caused me a lot of trouble, and I think it has driven me back to alcohol many times and hindered me in seeing the truth of my alcoholism. And, as if on some terrible vendetta, drunk me has always tried to vehemently *prove* to me how terrible I am. I do things when drunk I know I wouldn't even enjoy sober, and if there was an inkling of a chance that I might \\(on some base level\\), then it would still be in conflict with who I want to be and thus, not be worth it.\n\n\"See? You manipulated that girl to sleep with you. You don't care about love, you're just a superficial dick.\"\n\n\"Remember all those nasty things you said last night?\"\n\n\"Hey, that bus ride. You were a cocky asshole who made everyone's life miserable.\"\n\n\"Can you believe you spent all that money on a strip club? Lol, you're an asshole. Now go drink.\"\n\nIt becomes this self\\-fulfilling prophecy, and I fell for it time and time again. My alcoholism dripped into every aspect of my person. The demon came out when I drank, sure, but I didn't consider how it left a sucking chest wound in me even after the hangover had passed. This self\\-doubt... this terrible \"knowledge\" that in reality, no matter how well I do at work or what people say to me, I'm a monster undeserving of any praise or love or, least of all, forgiveness. It wasn't even directly related to my drinking \\- it was just a general notion that I was a fucked up human being that didn't deserve *any* of the good things in life. And life... well, that was slowly being sucked out of me, and I couldn't even see it for the lie it was.\n\nPaul Hedderman \\(thanks to u/sovietcableguy for sharing this gem with me\\) compares alcoholism to a parasite. It can't drink on its own accord, so it relies on the host \\(me\\) to drink for it, so that it can live *through* me. The best way for it to ensure its survival is to convince the host that it itself is the host. But I realize now that the things I've done while drunk... it's not me. It's some malformed, simple, perverted shade of me, but it isn't me. I don't want to let that demon hijack my life anymore. I'm not willing to let him sit at the wheel anymore. But finally, I realize, that I can't do that alone. If I fight alone, all this energy will eventually be co\\-opted and turned on me, and I will drink again. As one of the AA\\-members at a meeting I attended said, 'Nobody around this table lacks willpower. In fact, you probably have more than most... that's not what makes us drink.'\n\nI am powerless. And that's okay. Understanding that has been the most liberating thing I have ever experienced... and becoming free from the demon; reclaiming the ship, is now my foremost objective. If I don't, I will lose everything \\- my life included. I don't intend to perish like *that*.\n\nIt's time to get better, and to be honest about it. I'm ready.\n\nHope you guys have an amazing day, and for all our sakes, IWNDWYT.\n\nP.S: Sorry for the absolute wall of text \\- I had a lot on my mind.\n\nEDIT: Formatting",

   "selftext": "This is kinda rambly, I just wanted to share it with you guys.\n\nI prepped a patient today who was going to get a defibrillator implanted.  Nice guy.  I had taken care of him last week when I picked up a shift in ICU.  History of alcoholism, substance abuse, was positive for tricyclics upon admission.  Not detoxing or anything, just a nice, soft spoken dude.  When the team lead was going over the list with me yesterday she mentioned the tricyclics thing, along with how he had freely admitted to abusing some kind of over the counter thing, I can't remember what it was.  She said it with this kind of brief widening of her eyes, as if to say he was going to be trouble.  She mentioned the tricyclics with this tone of well you get what you deserve.  I assured her I had taken care of him and he was a nice guy and wouldn't be any trouble.  It bothered me though.\n\nSo today, he and I are waiting for the OR team to pick him up, and we get to talking.  He tells me he is an alcoholic, has been sober 13 years, and had been going to AA twice a day lately.  He says he enjoys that he can sometimes help other people when he goes to meetings.  He tells me his wife divorced him due to his drinking but lately things had been better, and she had even kissed him the other day.  He tells me he really wants to get completely clean and is going to try really hard once he gets out of the hospital.  He was in the Navy.  Used to be in marine sciences.  Enjoys writing, said he liked to write funny stuff because he liked making people laugh.  He was a complete, flawed, and genuine human being.  Full of pain and remorse and hope and self awareness and sweetness.  I told him I was about five months into my latest attempt to get and stay sober.  We talked about how nice it is to share stories when you're trying to stay sober, and how important it is to find people to share those stories with.  I really enjoyed talking to him. \n\nI go and sit down at the nurses station, and my coworker immediately starts ribbing me, implying he was full of shit, that his alcoholism meant that he had brought his heart problems on himself.  Which, ok, duh.  That can be true, substance abuse can mess with your health.  It probably is the reason he needs a defibrillator.  But he said it in a way that was so lacking in any kind of sympathy or depth.  It was like they could only see that he had a history of substance abuse, without any regard for how he had gotten there, or where he was now.  It was like it didn't even matter that he hasn't had a drop in thirteen years.  And it made me so angry.  When do you stop being judged for who you were in the past?  I know it doesn't matter what other people think, but it seems so cruel and small to take this entire person, this real person, who was so excited that his ex wife had kissed him last week for the first time in a long time, and reduce him to nothing but a lousy drunk.  People suck sometimes.",

   "selftext": "Hi. I am finding that 2 to 3 days without alcohol is when the extremely vivid nightmares and auditory hallucinations start. I am ready to be done with alcohol, and so while me and my boyfriend were on vacation, I had quit for 3 days. Then, the nightmares started, and the auditory stuff (some scary shit) (this isn't the first time I had quit, so I wasn't shocked). I had to fly back today and he will fly back saturday, and even without all this withdrawal crap I can't stand being alone in our creaky old house. So I drank some again, but I really didn't want to. I'm just scared of withdrawal. Should I wait til he gets home to stop? I have heard it is dangerous to stop on your own (it killed my uncle in a horrible way), but I am serious about the quitting thing. I'm actually there, it's just this one hurdle. Please let me know if you've had experience with this. I'm pretty frightened, but I do not want to miss work by going to a hospital or something...how would I explain that? I'm in a professional position, with a lot of responsibility, and no one there knows about my drinking. \n\nEdited to attempt a bit more clarity. Sorry, guys, was reading back through and I sound pathetic. I'm just scared, because I have not gone 3 days without drinking in...a long time. Like, I cant remember when. The 3 day mark has always hit me with weird shit, and now I'm alone, so I dont know what to do.\n\nEdited to say thank you for the responses. I will contact my GP to get her recommendations on where to go. I think my worry stems particularly from my uncle who died from this very thing. Not a drop of alcohol found in his autopsy, but he stopped on his own and went crazy and died alone. This week, during the sober days, I had a glimpse of what things could be like, and I dont want to die. So, thank you.\n\nEdited again: drinking tonight again to stave this off...I'm a coward, and I cant stand the thought of hearing those voices while im alone. I was hoping to pass out before dark but it didn't happen, itll be okay though. One thought I keep having tonight is that, I'm ready. I never had this before, usually it takes a hangover and a million regrets before I feel ready to give it up. Now I'm anticipating the end of drinking. I read a good book recently, how to kick the drink easily, so ridiculously titled and so 5th grade level reading, but it made me understand I dont have to miss anything about drinking. I'm eager to give this up, I saw how good it could be earlier this week, I just dont want to be scared. Does that make any sense? Thanks, random reddit people for being good folks. I'll check back in a couple days.\n\nUpdate: doc isn't in office until Monday, and other docs not available today, fine, I'll be okay, I had just a little today, I really think this tapering thing could work, but guess what, now I have some upper respiratory thing and a fever. Great timing. I'm so ready to feel better and start living.\n\nFinal edit. Doing good. Got sick as hell with a cold, so I guess you could say I tapered with nyquil. I think I got this, guys! I expect nightmares for a couple weeks but what the hell, I can handle that. Thanks so much to everybody. I cant wait to start my life again.",

   "selftext": "I'll warn you before you venture further, this is going to be a long post. I have noone to tell it to, so basically it's just you guys, I'm sorry.  \n\nAs I have mentioned in the title, I came to realize I have three strong ongoing addictions that are basically crippling my life. It took time to realize that I suffer from all three. I have been a part of NoFap community (eventhough lurking mostly) for quite a while but so far I only thought my problem is PMO.  \n\nSo now to list all three: Gaming, PMO and alcoholism. But if I was to sort them from the toughest to the easiest one it would be difficult for me because they all are strongly tied to eachother, so I just sorted them by the earliest contact.\n\nGaming: I have been playing strategic games since my very early childhood and I loved it because it allowed me to put myself into a role of a big conqueror and a leader of the bigger picture. Since I wasn't really liked in school because of my looks (ginger), I prefered to spend afternoons by the computer instead of outside with my peers. Later on, when the Internet became widespread I started playing online games and well guys, I can tell you, these games can be addictive.\n\nPMO: I have always been told that P is a very bad thing and I was basically scared to even look for it and since in my early childhood it was only magazines and late night movies in TV it was not really a problem. But when I got in my puberty years I just felt some unknown tension in my inner areas and it was kinda the same time when I got connected to the broadband Internet and this is how it started. I still didn't feel very good about it, I felt very guilty whenever I would PMO, I would confess every week or even more often, I would make myself a big decisions that now I stop once and for all but I just couldn't resist for more than two weeks. When I got to my early adult years I heard a lot from my peers that it is not anything wrong so eventually I stopped caring and let it loose whenever I could (which meant parents out of reach).  \n\nAlcoholism: My dad has been drinking alcohol in large amounts since whenever I can remember, I have been witnessing quarrels since for ever and as I saw my dad in the state he was, I got quickly drawn into the state that I would NEVER touch the alcohol because I saw what it does with people. My peers started experimenting with alcohol as early as in the age of 14 and the later it went, the harder they pressured me to join them. I was really assertive about this thing (and it really didn't improve my unpopularity situation) but I was strongly convinced it is a bad way. But once I passed 18 and it actually became LEGAL to me, I gave it a go. I didn't like alcohol at first, I started from one beer, then two beers, etc. And so I was going more and more loose at parties. Then I got fired from my studies, I felt depressed, started drinking two beers every afternoon, just to help my sleep and not think about the failure. Then three beers, then sometimes more at the weekends. \n\nSince this post has already gotten long, I'll try to get all three parts together now:  \nI am 26 years old graduated (Master of Science) unemployed boy who aims to be a programmer (but lacks experience) who:  \n* spends all his days gaming  \n* drinks beers or vodka at nights which results in feeling very bad at the next day  \n* goes PMO whenever he feels bad  \n\nTo add some more details: my first encounter with an ED was at the birthday party with a random girl: I didn't really care because I was heavily drunk but it should be an alarming singal. Then I made an unhappy relationship with a girl (I loved her, she didn't love me back) and she gave me just one chance to try sex, I failed there too. Then I tried escort, a failure there aswell. So basically I am a 26 years old virgin too.  \n\nNow, summing up, I am trying to set myself some dates to stop the addictions like: the New Year, my birthday, the 1st day of the new month, basically some day that I could easiliy follow my progress from. But I always fail that once I get put in front of some unsettling event or depressing experience, my psyche is just too weak so I escape to alcohol and PMO again.  \n\nIf I made this story hard to read, I'm sorry. My English is not that good and neither are my writing skills.  \n\nI want to stop this vicious cycle. I want to get free. How do I do that?\n",

Connection with others is everything - connect to a sober community.\n2. Go inward, connect with and resolve your inner pieces, they are your key to connecting with a higher power. Meditation and mindfulness are helpful as hell. Move from intellectualizing and realize your conscious monkey mind is a tiny percentage of your inner resources.\n3. Learn to tolerate discomfort and impatience, and focus on doing the next right thing. This is hard. You are exercising your ability to tolerate discomfort and to move forward in the absence of immediate reward. When you do this it is like a muscle, and soon discomfort is less of a trial and you have strength you never realized.\n\nEDIT: I feel foolish, giving advice to others when I can't get it together myself.

   "selftext": "  And if someone can explain this to me I would be grateful. \n\n\\(so rats get free booze. Wow! if I had only known\\)\n\n##### By Ben Taub\n\n03 MAR 2016, 00:00\n\nScientists investigating the role of dopamine in alcoholism have come up with some surprising evidence that may help to explain why addicts find it so difficult to stay away from booze. Publishing their findings in the [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/02/19/1506012113), the researchers suggest that when an alcoholic stops drinking, the brain\u2019s ability to use dopamine changes, altering the way that the reward system is wired.\n\nLike many drugs, alcohol is known to stimulate the production of a [chemical messenger](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21521/) called dopamine, which activates the so\\-called reward center of the brain. Previous [studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21744309) into the nature of addiction have revealed that this dopamine response is significantly reduced in alcoholics, leading to a need to drink more in order to feel a buzz.\n\nThis reduction in dopamine levels causes what is known as a hypodopaminergic state, although little is known about what happens to the brain\u2019s reward system when alcoholics try to stop drinking and enter a period of abstinence.\n\nTo investigate this, researchers began by examining brain tissue from deceased alcoholics. They found that these brains had fewer of a particular type of dopamine receptor than normal brains. Called D1 receptors, these are the sites on the membranes of neuronal cells to which dopamine binds, causing these neurons to become excited. Any reduction in these receptor sites would therefore be expected to decrease the brain\u2019s responsiveness to dopamine, thereby explaining why alcohol fails to satisfy.\n\nIn addition, these brains were found to have fewer [dopamine transporter](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/15/3/1714.full.pdf) sites, which allow for any unused dopamine to be sucked back up and recycled. So, as with D1 receptors, the disappearance of these sites is likely to hinder the brain\u2019s ability to use dopamine.\n\nThe study's authors also note that the brains of deceased alcoholics displayed no reduction in D2 receptor sites, which bind with dopamine in order to inhibit, rather than excite, neurons. All in all, this evidence explains how alcohol dampens the brain\u2019s reward center, compelling alcohol\\-dependent individuals to continually seek stimulation through booze.\n\nNext, the study authors sought to determine the sequence of events leading to this situation. To do so, they used radiography techniques to track dopamine levels in the brains of alcohol\\-dependent rats that were denied alcohol for several weeks.\n\nThey discovered that dopamine levels dropped during the first six days, confirming the existing theory that acute alcohol withdrawal is characterized by a hypodopaminergic state. Interestingly, during this initial period, the availability of dopamine receptor sites and transporter sites were found to be normal.\n\nHowever, after three weeks, the researchers noted that dopamine levels were in fact elevated, as the number of available receptor and transporter sites plummeted, so that the rats\u2019 brains resembled those of the deceased alcoholic humans. This increase in extracellular dopamine levels is explained by the fact that less of it is able to bind to receptor sites, and therefore more of it remains unused in the gaps between neurons, known as synapses.\n\nSignificantly, at the three\\-week mark, the rats displayed continued behavioral effects associated with alcohol cravings.\n\nAs such, the study authors conclude that, while acute alcohol withdrawal may be associated with a hypodopaminergic state, prolonged abstinence actually leads to a hyperdopaminergic state \u2013 meaning dopamine levels in the brain are higher than normal. Crucially, they say that both of these states are representative of a dysfunctional reward system, and therefore increase a person\u2019s vulnerability to relapse.\n\n[http://www.iflscience.com/brain/what\\-happens\\-alcoholics\\-brains\\-when\\-they\\-quit\\-drinking/](http://www.iflscience.com/brain/what-happens-alcoholics-brains-when-they-quit-drinking/)",

(I never believed in Santa because my parents were hardcore materialists, every present I got literally had written on it \"From Mom or From Dad\") - (yes, Christmas is a big thing for non-religious people too - even though modern Christmas as we celebrate today has almost nothing to do with Christianity, it's a good old Norse, end of year booze-up after all, always was) (Christianity stole the end of year Yule festival from the Pagans to lessen Pagan power and to increase their own).  \n\nBut, I also think/know that lying is a very complex mental process and it takes a fair amount of creativity and intelligence to lie and to lie well. It's usually bad to lie, but I like to think that I'm quite good at lying. It could be because I was very lonely as a child, and making up stories/\"lies\" in my own head was a totally normal thing to do to cure the boredom.\n\nLying is usually thought of as very bad, and totally shunned by a lot of people far smarter than me in the brain science field (who say that you should never ever lie) - but I can't divorce myself from the fact that lying is a great mental exercise, and probably good for the brain - it reinforces creativity and higher brain function, is it not? \n\nWhen it comes to alcoholism - well, we've all lied quite a bit in our lives, no doubt, but would the pain of realizing the truth (I think we all have to be honest), but also having everyone in your life realize the truth, be worth it, against having them not be aware of our problems?\n\nIs lying an inherently wrong thing - or is it sometimes okay, sometimes unavoidable, or sometimes necessary?\n\nMany chairs.  \n\n  ",

I also have mitral valve prolapse, but have been told I don't need any treatment for this. \n\nAs for family history, my father died when I was 14 from alcoholism. He had epilepsy, ankylosing spondylitis and diabetes. My mother has had a heart attack, although is fine now. Family history of angina, diabetes, cancer and strokes. \n\nThis year has been tough, I have had viral tonsillitis for 6 weeks now, although my tonsils never really go down even when it subsides. I have been referred to see a specialist and hopefully get them removed. I have also had tender kidneys at times, and was tested for a kidney infection but that was negative. I suspect that was perhaps a reaction to the penicillin I was on. \n\nI suffer from chronic pain, predominantly in my back but when I exert myself I suffer for days after, with flu\\-like symptoms and muscle fatigue. I have recurring costochondritis.  I also have a number of sleep issues: sleep paralysis 2\\-3 times a week, night terrors, and most recently I have severe restless leg at night. It affects my foot, and has begun affecting my face. I have found massage helps, but I am still unable to sleep soundly. I get about 3\\-4 hours of unrestful sleep a night. I have regular dizzy spells, usually when I get up from a seated position and I faint 2 or so times a week. I also suffer from migraines 1\\-2 times a week.\n\nSo far, I have been tested for diabetes \\(with a urine test, clear. I also have a blood sugar monitor and this has yielded fairly normal results, albeit slightly low sometimes\\). I have had my iron levels checked, all normal. I take vitamin D supplements, multivitamins and iron and always have done.  I wore a 24 hour blood pressure monitor and was told this was fine. Although readings I have done myself have a resting pulse rate of 110 on average, and my diastolic pressure is sometimes well over 100. I had an ECG and was told this was fine. \n\nI have been prescribed Pregabalin \\(lyrica\\) to help with pain and restless leg, and have taken this before. It does make my pain disappear, however the side effects such as fatigue make work/university very difficult, and I am learning to drive so I don't wish to affect my concentration. I have spoken to my doctor about this and he is happy for me to resume when I am ready. \n\nAlthough my mental health is fine right now, it is deteriorating rapidly with the lack of sleep. I'm really just looking for some advice as to what I could ask my doctor next, or if there is anything obvious I am missing such as other deficiencies? I've run out of ideas!",

Times goes by and I just celebrated another birthday, I have no friends, all my family is dead, my relationship is toxic, I can barely leave bed most days, I hate the sun with a passion and how much is destroys my skin with freckles every inch of my body. I am just so miserable and the pain is constant. ",

   "selftext": "People have started to joke about it. I'm in my late 20's and self-employed, tho I am not working since Xmas after watching a horrible family death (in a hospital no less). \n\nI used to wallow in my misery and cry myself. Now, I don't feel anything. The only way to feel a bit happy and relaxed is after a drink. I drink 21% stuff and can get through a litre a day/night. I don't FEEL addicted, I normally drink 3 days in a row and a few off.. no reason just don't feel like it. I drink the litre over a 10-12 hour period, sometimes I pour myself a glass at 10am.... because I want the buzz and a good start to my day. I always chug pints of water throughout the day though and don't experience any hangovers thanks to this. I never drive even after one drink, never blackout or get to vomiting stage. I don't do drugs or smoke. I just drink enough to be happy and when it wears off a bit I top up. Sober me is miserable, irritable, horrible, depressed... 1 drink \"me\" is happy and everyone wants to be around me.\n\nBut that's not me. Am I actually an alcoholic? Is my relationship based on the drunk me and not the real me? :(",

Do you substitute with anything bad or good?\n\nFor myself I try really really hard to exercise and learn new things. But I know that when I drink, I can't stop and it weakens my willingness plus makes me horny AF. And I had many troubles with thad circle since... always pretty much.\n\nI'm really interested in your thoughts and experiences!",

   "selftext": "Okay, so I an eighteen-year-old female and let's just say I've had a rather unique life. I don't like to bitch and moan but I do need help, the trauma that I've death with abuse, homelessness, abandonment reckless alcoholism, death etc has to lead to me having a rather fucked mental state. I was diagnosed as having long-term depression starting from the age of five along with body dysmorphia anxiety insomnia and I now have suspected bipolar. what I need help with is, I have these \"voices\" if you will in my head telling me that I'm just moaning and that I'm just seeking attention and being weak and pathetic, and I'm trying to tell them to fuck off but it's rather difficult. I was just wondering if any of you have multiple diagnoses? how do you deal with it? I've been trying to get a doctor's appointment to discuss medication and treatment but I'm kind of scared I'll be leaving for university in september and I don't want to be treated badly or kicked off my course because of my mental health, I'm not in a bad way per say not like suicidal or anything but because of the label's and the stigma attached to it I'm scared. if any of you could give me tips on managing multiple disorders or to point out the fact I'm being a whiny bitch that needs to shut up and get on with it, I would be most appreciative, Sorry about how long winded it is.
