   "selftext": "Since I can remember, my feelings have always been invalidated. My grandma told me I was gonna get raped when I was in 5th grade and all this other stuff, I told my dad, and he did nothing. I told him about my depression in middle school and he said \u201cI feel like that everyday.\u201d I brought up my depression and suicidal thoughts my senior year and he told me \u201cwell I almost lost my job,\u201d and told me I was just like my mom (she was a bipolar alcoholic and died in 2014). I\u2019ve gone to the doctor for several reasons and all they say is, \u201cwell you should try eating. You\u2019re underweight.\u201d (I eat regularly and have always been small). I was in love with a guy and my sister\u2019s friend was all over him. I told her it upset me and she said, \u201cwell she\u2019s just an angsty 16 year old girl.\u201d \u201cShes so dramatic. She thinks that because I have boobs I\u2019m trying to get at him.\u201d I was dating a guy and that same friend told me all these stories about how they had slept together before. Once again, I was told I was being dramatic because I did not want to hear about it. Today, she was bragging about how a guy I was with for a year super liked her on tinder. I was with her when she \u201cliked,\u201d him. It was supposed to be a joke. My sister did the same thing. Of course, they both told me how he messaged them. I voiced that I was upset given that I\u2019m not over him and just got ignored. I\u2019m 19 now and I\u2019m so over being invalidated. Whenever I express my emotions, it\u2019s just \u201cokay whatever,\u201d but it\u2019s totally fine for everyone else too. And this is with ALL areas of my life. I even remember graduating at the top 9% of my district and not a single person caring, but my friends making congratulations posts about our friend making a remix on SoundCloud?? There really isn\u2019t a body to this, but I hate it. No matter what I do I\u2019ve always been told I\u2019m being immature nd dramatic. But if the tables were turned, I wouldn\u2019t hear the end of it. ",

   "selftext": "Anyone dealt with this?  My left hip has been hurting progressively since September. I thought I slept on it wrong, then I thought it was just dehydration. \n\nWell sober HC is really proud of his daughter because she's taken interest in wrestling and she asked me to get on the floor and teach her some of the stances and take downs. And I couldn't. \n\nI went to the orthopedic doctor today and through xrays he thinks I have avascular necrosis and now I'm getting and MRI Wednesday. \n\nThe nurse asked how I'd number my pain and (I always do this dumb shit) I said \"at it's worst 6 maybe 7 and a half?\n\nOnce the doctor saw the Xrays he said \"7 and a half?!\" That's at least a 9. Then I explained I knew pain tolerance was different for people and I didn't want to come across as a pussy. \n\nWell just to make sure he's right I have an MRI Wednesday morning. I hate these doctor appointments because I'm so scared of losing my job. \n\nHe told me the two options we would probably have would be for him to open up my hip and then drill into the head of my femur in hopes of sparking blood flow. \n\nThe other option is a hip replacement. Which I immediately said no too. I'm 32 for fucks sake. \n\nI just didn't know if anyone has been through something similar?  When I Google it I see that it's genetic and caused by alcoholism. So there's two chips on my bingo board. \n\nI dunno. He made it seem like it was a very under researched issue and that it could lead to amputation years and years from now. \n\nMy xray was really telling my right hip looked beautiful. My left hip looked like the head of my femur had turned into a saw blade.",

   "selftext": "I can't even count the number of times I've tried to stop drinking. Longest I've gone was three weeks. It always seems to fall apart - evidenced by this being my fifth(?) throwaway just for this sub.\n\nWhen I envision a life without alcohol, it all seems so ridiculous. Like, how could I ever lead a sober life? There are too many parties, too many outings, too many restaurants and dinners and holidays and open bars at conferences and so. many. ways. to screw up. \n\nBut I know I have to. My father was an alcoholic, my mother is an alcoholic, my uncle, my grandparents, it's in my genes for sure. It's caused me to do reckless things, it's caused me to waste a lot of money, it helped in pushing me to drop out of college, and it's currently affecting my academics at my new school. I've talked to councilors, I've used this page, I went to an AA meeting once, *once*. \n\nHow do I do this? How do I even begin to do this?",

   "selftext": "I have no intention of ever stepping near a psychotropic medication again so if anyone is going to comment \"just go back on it\" I'm not going to listen lol. (Sorry, I guess alcoholics are stubborn and mean)\n\nI was put on an SSRi at 5 years old (obviously without my consent) for severe anxiety/problems \"self-regulating\" my emotions. From then on I spent my entire childhood and adolescence up until age 20 in a daze. I am not kidding when I say I had barely any friends and have trouble recalling a lot of memories from this time. It's very disturbing and strange. My dose kept going higher as I got older, and I developed many side effects from it such as loss of libido, developing anorexia (it made me gain so much weight that as a teenage girl I was pretty much desperate to fix this problem that seemed out of my control), NO social life whatsoever, basically feeling like a zombie.\n\nAt 20 I decided after years of reading studies and information about these drugs I wanted to wean off. At first it was fine. I felt more alive than I had in years. I suddenly...\"learned\" how to be creative? I started drawing and playing guitar, things I was never interested in before. It's almost like I gained a personality that wasn't there. But after about 6 months things started to take a downward spiral. I got very depressed and irritable. I had to leave my very demanding university. I went back on a low dose and things started to seem OK. \n\nRecently I decided I just couldn't stand it anymore. On seemingly even the smallest dose I lose all creativity and libido, and as a 22 year old woman I know that's not normal. Again, it makes me socially inept, almost giving me social anxiety and having no interest at all in interacting with other humans. I did/do have a boyfriend but as far as friends, zero. After I enrolled back in college I just started to see again how this was affecting me having a normal life, making me feel zombielike and zapping me of normal emotions and personality..I missed feeling things deeply and just feeling alive. So I tapered off again..\n\nI started to learn during the taper that a couple of glasses of wine before sleep really really eased the withdrawal symptoms. They let me have a good night's rest and got rid of all of my traumatic thoughts/emotions/instability of going off this drug my body was so used to. After I was completely off the meds for about 2 weeks I started to have discomfort..very hard to describe but almost just like a lack of homeostasis..in the morning before my university classes. I go to a fairly demanding school and my education has always been very important to me and I started (unbelievably stupidly) to have a swig of something before my classes. It seemed to be the only thing that calmed me down enough to attend class and sit down and take notes without freaking out. I'm almost hesitant to use the term \"alcoholic\" because I'm not exactly binge drinking every night, but then again, I strongly feel I cannot function without alcohol, and panic when there is none available, which I feel are the classic definitions of an alcoholic..\n\nIt scares me a lot. My mother's father was an abusive, violent alcoholic and I grew up with a fear of alcohol. I literally did not have one drink until I turned 21, and now I don't even recognize myself in my behaviors. I'm scared and don't know what to do. I feel like it's only going to get worse over time. All I want to do is feel normal and be able to get my degree, while being off medication and having my personality...is that too much to ask? I don't really expect an answer...but it's nice to vent, and would be interesting to see if anyone else is in a similar position.",

That was just the gateway to 10+. \nNow looking back, I realize that I didn\u2019t even like most alcoholic drinks. They were often just a chore on my way to being hammered. I\u2019d bounce around from being a beer snob to a wine snob to a scotch snob to a bourbon snob, and was even a vodka snob at one point. Sometimes I\u2019d whip up a really awful hangover by being all of those intolerable characters in one night. \nHaving thought about it now, what I really loved about drinking wasn\u2019t the drinks, but the pre-drinking adrenaline rush, getting organized with friends to drink together, talking on the phone on a Friday after work about how fucked up we\u2019re about to get. I still miss that high, and that pre-activity rush of excitement is something I can still have, it\u2019s just that the activity has changed.

   "selftext": "In 32 days I'll be four years stone-sober, so take this with a grain of salt. Although I'd like to think I was somehow different from the driver I'm about to describe, I was not. I'm still an alcoholic and I always will be. The only \"caveat lector\" in my case is that public-transportation was widely available when I was a drinking man and 99% of the time I made good use of it or I walked. The other 1% I drove, and through mysteries of the universe that haven't been revealed to me yet, I never had an accident or got pulled over. Did I think I was a safe driver back then? Of course, which is a sure sign that I am actually just an asshole. I could have killed someone or destroyed entire families. Every day I go to bed sober I get to wake up the next morning and continue my \"second chance\" at life. So far I've had 1,428 of those mornings, which makes me a *recovering* asshole. \n\nToday on the way home about a mile down the road from work at 6:23 PM the SUV directly in front of me hit the guard rail on the right hand side of the road. Hard. The vehicle almost jumped the rail and would have flown into oncoming freeway trafic down the hill to our right. I take that stretch of freeway every morning. I thought for sure this person would stop ASAP, given the severity of the impact. These days I'm a certified first responder. I grabbed my cellphone, called 911 and put my hazards on. I was thinking I was *about to hop out of my car and check on the driver.* I applied the brakes, checked for traffic behind me and got ready to take my seat belt off and go check the driver's vitals. As I held my phone to my ear to talk to emergency dispatch, the vehicle sped up toward oncoming trafic on the opposite (left side) of the road. I dry heaved, almost puked. Guy didn't even stop, they *sped up* and started driving a semi-straight line down the street. \n\nAt this point I saw that no other cars had been hit but the vehicle wasn't stopping. I made the decision to try and carefully tail the car and identify the plate, it had a very specific bright yellow sticker in the back window. They were almost too far away to see by time I decided to follow. I was sure someone was about to die, but maybe I could direct EMS to whatever was about to unfold in front of me. By now my brain was a hot ball of adrenalin. EMS answers my call but I was speechless, they're asking me what happened. I say there's been an accident but the driver sped off, and they were probably doing 70 mph now off in the distance northbound, I was losing them until we approached a busy intersection, they put on their blinker to turn left so I slowed down. If someone swerved to miss a head-on collision with this car I didn't want to get hit as well. The driver was now more than 100 yards away. About 30 seconds later they successfully turned left into a gas station, I was releived they weren't still speeding toward the intersection. Where the hell did they go?\n\nI'll admit I was doing a rather poor job of conveying to emergency services that I originally called to coordinate EMS, but as the call progressed I managed to establish that this driver had hit a guard rail not a vehicle. I apologized to the emergency responder for having interrupted him but told him that I was trying to track the car down in the parking lot behind the gas station. I checked four or five vehicles, no match. There was one last car around the side of the building, with its passenger side tucked against the side of the L-shaped liquor store attached to the gas station... **Then I remembered**, back in my early twenties I'd stop here a few times a week to try new beers, before I realized they all tasted equally shitty, before I lost control of my drinking. *Nothing was going to keep this person from their booze* I thought... Anyways, I was looking for that bright colored sticker and... bingo. This was the vehicle and the driver wasn't inside.\n\nSo I stopped to catch my breath and spent the next 30 seconds describing the make/model/plate of this vehicle to the emergency responder.  I was asked if I wanted to go check on the driver but told them that it appeared the driver had already entered the liquor store. He and I both started to get the picture. The emergency responder seemed satisfied with what I had relayed and told me a police unit was on the way nearing my location and that they'd be looking for him if he left. The place is drenched with security cameras so they'd have gotten positive ID on both the driver in the store and the car in the lot in addition to my 911 call. With that I suppose it became a police matter and the emergency responder wrapped up the call.\n\nI had wanted to go rip their keys out of their hand and toss them into oblivion, I still wish I would have, but I was afraid I'd make things worse and scare this person back into traffic where they'd be even more likely to hurt or kill someone/themself. Short of me assaulting them I didn't know what else to do. I had been on the way to dinner with my mother and step-father, he's a retired police officer with 20+ years on the force. When I got there we talked about adrenaline, about how **I made the decision to pursue**. He commented that I was lucky they parked and stopped driving, saying \"yep that's what it's like, if you scared that person and they sped off and ran over a little girl you'd never forgive yourself\". \"You did more than most people would have but you're not the police\". I told him I'm definitely not cut out for that, I drove one mile tailing a drunk driver to a liquor store and I felt blinded by rage.\n\nI hope they throw the book at that driver, but they're still a person and they deserve help. And I'm still an alcoholic too!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

   "selftext": "29/F with mother 55 looking for some perspective \n\nHi reddit. First time poster in this sub. As the title says I\u2019m really looking for some perspective on my situation and how to deal / move forward in a positive way. \n\nIn a nutshell, both my parents suffered from alcoholism. My parents divorced at 6 and both remarried. Their spouses are a whole other issue, not really relevant. As a child I often hid the extent of drinking of one parent to the other in fear that I wouldn\u2019t be able to see them. At 15 I decided I did not want to pursue a relationship with my father due to his drinking (he was a violent drunk and often threatened to kill me). We did not speak for many years until he was in the hospital near death. We reconnected for 2 months until he passed on, due to liver failure. I was 19 at the time. It was difficult but I\u2019ve worked through these issues with therapy. \n\nMy mother, however, has been an on-going challenge. She struggles with alcohol addiction but also pharmaceutical\u2019s. I can\u2019t tell you exactly what but I know it\u2019s drug base simply because we she can go sober to comatose fucked up in under 30 minutes. \n\nAnyway, this has been a recurring problem throughout my life and a little over a year ago I decided to move to a different province and start over (more personal than family related). It went well but had its own struggles. I was out of work for a long time and barely surviving. \n\nsince the new year I\u2019ve been doing really well. Working multiple jobs to pay bills, basically doing what I need to do to survive. It\u2019s been hard but a detrimental learning experience in my life. I\u2019ve really come to realize how ungrateful I\u2019ve been for the life I\u2019ve had and not being able to even feed myself I l have a new appreciation for life. I\u2019m still not where I want to be but I have goals and I\u2019m always working towards them, etc. \n\nOnce I moved away my mother and I fought constantly. Generally about things that happened in the past that I didn\u2019t think were necessary to argue about when I lived a 2 day drive away. We took our space and slowly began to rebuild. Recently, I finally felt like I had a mother again. \n\nHowever, without fail, a few weeks into rekindling our relationship it reverts back to the way things used to be. For example, my mom will often call me up to complain about whatever hardship she\u2019s going through. Her financial situation is also poor and I completely understand how hard it is; however, sometimes I feel like our conversations our a battle between whose life is more shitty and I can\u2019t get over how awful that is. I don\u2019t want bad for her or for me. Sometimes I just want to talk to my mom and vent because she\u2019s my mom and I need her. I hate feeling like I can\u2019t do that. \n\nRecently, she asked if I was still wanting to keep all the belongings I left at her house. I said \u2018no, it\u2019s been over a year I\u2019m not attached anymore. There\u2019s a few sentimental things I want but besides that, try and sell it and keep the money.\u2019 During searching through my things she came across a childhood journal and felt compelled to read it. The part she read spoke about me, around 8 years old, lying to her about the extent of my fathers drinking. I lied to her because I was worried she wouldn\u2019t let me see him. Although this is true, it\u2019s been 20 years I don\u2019t feel the need to discuss it. She kept pressing and pressing. Eventually I told her point blank: this was 20 years ago, it was my private thoughts and it\u2019s not up for discussion. She apologized for being such a \u2018loser\u2019 and I reiterated that I never said that nor do I think that, but those are my private thoughts and I would never invade her privacy like that. We ended up getting into an argument over something unrelated a week later and now we are no longer speaking. \n\nOver the years I\u2019ve gone to many therapy groups based around codependency. I fully understand my role in her life and how I\u2019ve contributed to her illness by being a crutch. However, now at 30, living 5000km away from each other I still can\u2019t seem to break the cycle. If this happened a year ago I would have completely lashed out and caused a huge fight. I decided to handle it calmly which I think was a good first step for me. That being said, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s used to that type of reaction and tried to start a fight a week later over something else. \n\nI love my mother very much. Now as an adult I really appreciate all the sacrifices she made for me as a child. I moved away to break this cycle but it just keeps following regardless of what I do. I don\u2019t want to change her. I\u2019ve accepted her drinking as a reality I can\u2019t blame myself for or constantly worry about. I just want to have a healthy relationship with her and I\u2019m so lost on where to start. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions or has been through something similar? At a loss right now and just looking for suggestions. \n\nThanks! \n\n",

   "selftext": "So today is my new day one. In March, I managed to bust out almost three weeks of blissful sobriety. I truly enjoyed being sober and ended up kind of freaking out about the idea of participating in my best friends wedding newly sober (it was in mid-April), so I reasoned with myself it was probably best to just go ahead and relapse before the festivities and get back on the wagon after. I figured I\u2019d be able to do the bachelorette party, rehearsal dinner, wedding day, and then go back to how I was. Part of me knew I was probably going to fuck this up, but in true alcoholic fashion I managed to ignore all reasoning and logic and push forward with my plan. \n\nJust posting here to remind myself and anyone who may need a reminder how flawed this kind of thinking is. My \u201csober vacation\u201d almost immediately turned into a miserable month of binge drinking in secret and living like a total slob, disappointing the shit out of my SO (and myself), gaining weight, looking like Charlize Theron in \u201cMonster\u201d, struggling through work days, drinking as soon as I arrive home, having IBS and indigestion, and falling back into old thought patterns that I have something mentally/genetically wrong with me.\n\nI broke down yesterday and thought about actually going to rehab for the first time. The idea of committing myself to a treatment center has always been unbelievably terrifying to me, it\u2019s like completely admitting I have a huge problem and couldn\u2019t take care of myself and maybe I really am totally out of control of my own self. But yesterday that idea didn\u2019t scare me. It just sounded like a relief. Like maybe I could do something real for myself that would actually make a difference.\n\nSo I\u2019ve reached that point in my thoughts. I haven\u2019t made plans yet to go.

She lives in another province and plane tickets are expensive. My father, uncle and sister were all there for my Granddad when she passed. The last time I visited them I was hungover every day and I was not invested in appreciating my time with them.\n\nThis of course has been a fruitless endeavor that is self absorbed and ridiculous in hindsight, but in my sadness, I was angry. I became fixated on everything negative about the man I loved and hated for years. I came across  a recorded conversation I had with my ex during the most abusive point in our relationship.\n\nIn haste, I revisited it and realized how fucked he was, and how fucked I had become.\n\nThe iPhone recording of my ex and I, was one I took a night in a back alley when I was completely hammered at the bar he worked at. It was very near the end of our relationship; we were talking about how I felt he was drowning from the anxiety of his job that did not pay him enough nor respect him enough. He got in trouble for having anger issues and reprimanding the front of house staff (he was kitchen manager) and I was attempting to reopen the \u201cgo get counselling\u201d discussion which obviously never works when you\u2019re wasted.\n\nThis is why I never want to get into alcoholism again, hearing me slur and cuss just as much as he was makes me repulsed. This is verbatim what is recorded on my app:\n\nHim: *random mumbling* \u201c\u2026if somebody pisses me off and doesn\u2019t you know \u2013 treat me the way you know I\u2019m not \u2013 like \u2013 like I should be treated; \u2018look at me, I\u2019m a fucking psychopath!\u2019\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cYou\u2019re not a psychopath \u2013 \u201d\n\nHim: \u201cShut your fucking mouth.\u201d\n\nSilence for five seconds.\n\nHim: \u201cSo you\u2019re the person that I\u2019m talking about - *high pitch imitative voice* - \u2018OH you\u2019re not a psychopath\u2019 \u2013 shut up.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cYou\u2019re being very\u2026crazy right now.\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cWell you just shut your fucking mouth, you don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI\u2019m not \u2013 \u201d\n\nHim: \u201cYou know what?

I\u2019ve been like \u2013 I\u2019ve been around you for almost seven fucking years.\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cYou\u2019re right! I\u2019ve given you everything you\u2019ve asked for. You know what?

You can leave then! Perfect! We\u2019re on the same page!\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI\u2019m not trying to tell you that!

   "selftext": "I'm not sure where this exactly belongs, so I'll be posting it to a few subs.\n\nI need some help sorting through my feelings about my mom (doesn't everyone?). Growing up, my mom was awesome. She made all my Halloween costumes, homeschooled me (well, I might add), fostered my huge love of reading and the arts. She was funny, beautiful, kind, and very strong in her faith. She had/has depression but she was open about it and took medication. She sacrificed a lot for my siblings and I. She wasn't perfect by any stretch, we still had our normal mom-daughter spats but, I really respected and looked up to her.\n\nBut everything changed when my dad left and they got divorced when I was 15. She turned into the perpetual victim and what was once well-managed depression became full blown alcoholism. She went to work and worked hard but was not present for my younger sibling or me. Instead she got drunk every night and many nights, I had to go out looking for her because she didn't come home. She became very promiscuous, which after a fairly strict Christian upbringing, was a complete 180 from what I was taught.\nBeing extremely type-A, I picked up a lot of slack, especially with my brand new license. I took my sibling to all their various activities, packed lunches, bought presents. I was so mad at my dad for leaving that I went no contact for about five years, and truthfully, he was having his own breakdown and I really couldn't handle it.\nI see now that my behavior really enabled her, but at the time it was all I could do to keep from losing it. I developed anxiety disorder and started having severe panic attacks. I was running around trying to be mom, while also trying to go to school, work part time, and still be a normal teenager. I was trying so hard to keep everything together and keep up appearances.\n\nEverything came to a head when I came back from a mission trip Spring Break of my Sophomore year, and the whispering at school about my family was too much to ignore. I was the last to find out about an incident that happened with my mom and sibling while I was gone. It's too identifiable so I won't go into detail but lets just say she completely embarrassed me in front of my entire peer group. I was (am) a tight-ass, trying so hard to project an image of perfection and kids were making jokes about my mom in class.\n\nAfter all this, and her continued drinking, I lost all respect I had for my mom. It's like she died when my dad left and the person who remained was not my mother. I was so angry with her and as soon as I graduated, I left for college and didn't look back. She stayed in home town until my younger sibling graduated a couple years later then basically dropped younger sibling and left the country.\n\nNow she lives several states away and I end up seeing her about once a year. Her behavior hasn't really changed, although she tries to maintain it has. She tells me she doesn't really drink any more, but all her social media is photos of her at bars in skimpy costumes. I'm still so embarrassed by her behavior that it makes me act completely crazy when she comes around. After the last time she was here, I decided that I cannot have her visit any more and will tell her as much when she tries to visit this year.\n\nI barely talk to her now and it still makes me feel so guilty. I'm constantly second guessing my reaction to her. Like, compared to other parents on the RBN sub or JustNoFamily, she really isn't that bad. Am I being too harsh? Should I figure out how to just accept her as is? We don't have anything in common and I get really embarrassed and nervous when she talks because she has no filter any more. I can't tell her about the good things going on in my life because she seems to turn it around to be a pity-party for herself, while still maintaining that she \"loves her life\" and \"things are going soooooo great!\"\n\nFor my mental health, I do not follow her on social media and I have VVVLC, but that fact alone still leaves me feeling incredibly guilty, because if my child didn't talk to me, I would be devastated.\n\nI'm just looking for some advice on how to handle her and if I'm doing okay. I think if she had been a shitty mom the whole time, this would be a lot easier, but somehow I can't let go of the extremely fond memories I have of her growing up.\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you thank you so much for reading!",

Here\u2019s what I\u2019m going through now.\n\nI quit drinking caffeine in February of last year. I quit smoking in August of last year. I started working out regularly starting from January of this year. And I\u2019ve quit drinking as of April of this year. I drank heavily over the last 12 years \\(about half a dozen hard drinks during the day followed by 2 bottles of red wine each and every night\\). I drank moderately in the 15 years prior to that \\(beer and wine\\). I drank a lot when I was in the Army \\(12 pack of beer when I could afford it\\).\n\nNone of my habits were stopped cold turkey. The habits have weighed heavily on my mind over the years. In the months prior to giving up caffeine, I didn\u2019t drink as much coffee until, one day, I just stopped. Quitting cigarettes was similar. I would go outside to smoke less and less and, when I did smoke, half the time I was inhaling into my lungs and the other half into just my mouth. After a while, I was simply inhaling into my mouth then blowing the smoke out. Then I stopped.\n\nA similar pattern has been happening over the last weeks with my drinking. I\u2019ve wanted to quit for a while. I started drinking less and less. I realized I felt fine in the evenings when I didn\u2019t drink so much. I started subbing tea for wine as something to have in my hand through the night. Two weeks ago, I went 3 days without drinking. The next 2 days, I drank but not as much as I used to. Then I stopped. I made it through a weekend without drinking \\(Fridays and Saturdays were my heaviest drinking days\\); that was a BIG milestone for me. I\u2019m going to keep going. Next milestone is 2 weeks of no drinking, then a month, then 2 months and so on. One day at a time.\n\nI started taking ZzzQuil to help me sleep at night when I stopped drinking regularly. It\u2019s helped and I feel I can stop taking those soon as I\u2019ve realized recently I don\u2019t stare at the ceiling for hours these last few nights trying to fall asleep. I can actually have and remember my dreams now, something I\u2019ve not experienced in decades. I\u2019m losing weight. I have more energy. And I actually feel good about myself again. It\u2019s a journey and I appreciate the stories and thoughts everyone in this sub shares. You might think there\u2019s no target you\u2019re reaching when you post but, I can tell you, it\u2019s helped me.\n\nThank you.",

My father who was an alcoholic quickly drank himself to near death and has been housebound with my grandparents ever since. My mother who was always a dissapointing parent became upset with me being depressed and isolated. This manifested in severe psychological abuse everyday every moment with her for 3 years. A long 3 years. I had to raise my fucking self. It morphed me into an emotionally empty sociopath. \n\nI moved out of my house to live with my grandparents and dad when i was 17. After a year my depression had largely cleared up. I lost my sociopathic and isolated tendencies. After another year or so i felt composed enough that i didnt struggle without the guide and affection of parents... I was my own man. I cut off all contact with my mother.\n\nAfter this point i was not sad but emotionally detached meaning after a prolonged period of emotional stress the brain has adapted such that I feel much less of any emotion... including joy. Plus intense lonelyness as i was so isolated in my teen years but i didnt feel a lonelyness emotion just a concious dissapointment which was horrible.\n\nNowadayd I use drugs, alcohol and parties to escape and the days in between are a constant existential crisis. I took some strong ecstacy in january and it changed me permanently. It made me mildly depressed for 2 months. Now I can feel more emotions and i cant deal with them. I struggle with motivation as all i want at the bottom of my heart is a woman who loves me and a clean head. Everyday i have less and less will to go on. I dont see myself living past 30.

I have some odd symptoms, and my biggest concern is sleeping and a few others. \n\nI am also diagnosed with PTSD and have been experiencing derealization disorder for a year straight. I have some symptoms that im not sure if theyre particular to anything I suffer from, or if theyre the onset of my moms schizophrenia. \n\nI can go to bed at 12 AM and wake up at 10 AM and I won't feel refreshed at all. It's worry me cause of course theres more information on fatigue with schizophrenia then there is with anxiety/depression and fatigue. Of course if you ask a therapist, they say Oh yeah it can be caused by anxiety. I just wanted to know if any of you experience fatigue like this, it will reassure me greatly. \n\nI guess the other big symptom I have is paranoia, but whenever I take a paranoid personality quiz it says I don't have one. I'm not paranoid over everyone though. \n\n\nI have only been told two times that I was acting irritational. One time I was in the middle of the woods with my friend and there was a man sitting on a tree stump. He saw us and stood up. I said to my friends \"lets go the other way\" and I started speed walking. They told me to chill. The fact they were freaking out makes me feel like I have something wrong with me, but on the other hand there was literally a man sitting in the middle of the woods and he got up when he saw us.\n\nThe other time I walked to a food store with my friend at 3 AM. The food store was closed, but there were like one or two cars in the parking lot. A sketchy looking lady got out of her car and started walking towards us. I started walking the opposite direction fast. My friend told me to calm down. This again made me feel like something was wrong with me.\n\n\nI think it's worth noting Im flinchy and have an extreme startle response, but I wasnt abused. I was around my alcoholic father who would go on rampages and I didnt feel like the enviroment was safe. Im wondering if the two things I listed could be contributed to PTSD, or are actually normal signs of paranoia. In both situations I thought it was justified to be sketched out, especially the worst one. I know no one here can diagnose me, but I was just asking for your guys input and if you had any similar experiences\n\n",

Key word \"was\"\n\nThat was all a lie I told myself to permit myself to keep doing the same things day In and day out. Im so happy for the changes I made and the results of the life choices I decided to stick with.

Like the beer!\"  A few chuckles came from the class and I could only respond by saying \"yes, similar name to the beer\"\n\nIt really rubbed me the wrong way. Nobody in that class knows my story but it was so disheartening, because it was the first time since being sober that some One has said that. It almost felt like \"you are the beer\" or \"you and the beer are the same\"  I know this is not the case,ans I'm probably just a little sensitive but it really was an upsetting exchange that left me feeling like the alcoholic I used to be.  \n\nThis doesn't make me want to go out and drink, it makes me want to distance myself more from it, but I don't know how else I can do that. \n\nWhile Speaking on the subject of sobriety, I have left most of my interactions with (non sober) people feeling bad or crappy, or just reminded of the low life I used to live.

I\u2019m half black half Mexican and when I was growing up I went thru identity crisis and still do today. I never had friends Bc all the kids at school would make me a target to poke fun at and beat up bc I couldn\u2019t protect myself. I would stay up all night at home playing video games dreaming of making friends then go to school and fall asleep in all my classes Bc I was mentally tired to even try anymore. My isolation got so bad when I got into high school I became mute and stayed to myself. At lunch I\u2019d go to a hall where no one was and sit and cry Bc I wondered what\u2019s wrong with me ? At 18 I changed I got out of that started making friends going out on dates and stuff ran track. I felt regular again but still something felt wrong. People tell me the way I speak and the way I am about myself makes them angry. That I look down on people and think I am better then everyone. I am a evil person so says my first girlfriend. I don\u2019t blame her id always tell her over the phone \u201cwhy don\u2019t people respect me\u201d \u201cwhy do I get treated like shit\u201d \u201cI am creative what am I doing wrong\u201d showing her my insecurities... till she finally got sick of it. I drove her away. I am overly emotional and dramatic. I embarrassed out of trying to make our relationship work once in public and 4 times showing up to her place when she didn\u2019t want me too. Then finally I tried to break into her home when I was being avoided for 3-4 weeks..... we lasted 10 months. An I do not wnana kill myself because of her but because I do not feel normal. It feels as if my mind is having 4-5 thoughts at once and i can\u2019t function correctly. As the day I tried to break in it felt as if someone took over my body as if I was in flight or fight mode and my body was fighting to keep its life. As she left the house in a Lyft ride I awoke to my senses and felt death.... now I\u2019m at my worse and haven\u2019t left my apartment room for 2 months rent is due today and I have no money. I\u2019m plotting my suicide soon Bc i have no health insurance and truly think it\u2019s too late for me. I\u2019m too far behind in being mentally ready for life and all of these new situations are hitting me like a train. My girlfriend was helping me get better but as soon as she saw the crazy that was it. People are giving me advice left and right Religion wise, Scientific wise, and life wise, but none none of the advice clicks thru my head. It\u2019s like my brain simply can\u2019t process \u201clisten to this person\u201d until it\u2019s too late. I am not lazy nor am i a attention seeker. I\u2019m battling these negative thoughts every day and they overpower my positive thinking. I had two jobs and was going to school 2017 I till March. I was purely living off fighting to keep my relationship working with my girlfriend (Sad) but 20 years of my life I couldn\u2019t find my purpose and still can\u2019t .

   "selftext": "Waiting in line at the grocery store, overheard the following comments between the checker and customer. \n\nChecker: Gah, only three months to my next vacation. It only took one day being back from vacation before I realized that I need another one. Ugh I need a drink. \n\nCustomer: I wish I didn\u2019t drink for those 23 years so I could have one too. \n\nMy first thought walking away was: wow, it\u2019s impressive this guy is so open about not drinking. I wonder how those who choose to undergo not drinking, especially the new ones, would benefit from it being more socially acceptable for others to talk openly about not drinking. It would definitely helps other the challenging situation of not drinking when others are drinking and not wanting to make a big deal of it.   I also thought - it\u2019s 1pm... and that\u2019s an inappropriate comment from this employee. \n\nI sat in my car a few minutes and couldn\u2019t help but feel this event held more significance than just being impressed by the customer\u2019s openness. On reflecting some more, I think there\u2019s a few clues to deeper truths here:\n\n*I imagine there is not a coincidence between the checker associating vacation, leisure, and drinking. I imagine he drank heavily over his recent vacation and that\u2019s why it was the immediate next thought after talking about vacation. \n\n*the phrase \u201cI need a drink\u201d is very problematic.  It\u2019s something I\u2019ve used in the past. Thinking about my own emotional growth I\u2019m working on, this phrase implies: \u201cdrinking is my most powerful coping mechanism and I literally cannot persevere this challenge without drinking.\u201d I don\u2019t think drinking when stressed is necessarily always bad, but when it becomes your default move and you lose confidence in your own ability to support yourself emotionally you are being self destructive. \n\n*As someone who has been a depressed pessimist for most of my life until recently working on shifting that perspective, it really struck me that the checker was SUPER negative in his words and particularly his tone of voice. This \u201cugh I can\u2019t tolerate this moment\u201d feeling is one I had for many years when doing any activity that wasn\u2019t drinking. I can\u2019t help but think a pattern of drinking is a significant contributor to this view. Maybe it can develop independently.... or maybe this worldview leads to escaping through drinking. But I think there\u2019s an amplifying effect that drinking does, where it either increased susceptibility to pessimism or amplifies its underlying effect. \n\n*Ive felt a shift in myself and my own confidence to be able to cope, and it\u2019s impacted every area of my life. Cutting down drinking has led to the highest self esteem of my life. I think this is rooted in my self-worth being so damaged by feeling like I needed drinking and couldn\u2019t control it. I see now that I don\u2019t need it. And maybe I can control it. But I\u2019m not desperate to figure that out. Knowing that I can control it by either avoiding or just having better discipline gives me the confidence that I can survive any hard times. There is no more doom and gloom about the future. I see a lot of hard work ahead but I know I can do it, will grow through it, and am able to use this to motivate myself when I\u2019m feeling lazy. \n\n*Why do people feel the need to advertise their drinking? I\u2019m talking social media, dating apps, etc. there are a TON of people who post pictures with drinks in hand, but they don\u2019t ever do this holding s non-alcoholic drink. Is everyone trying to prove they\u2019re fun? Like... I assume everyone drinks moderately unless I witness them over indulging or they explicitly say they abstain. Is this just a way that insecurity shows through? Like - \u201clook I\u2019m fun and wild?\u201d\n\n",

I have an injury from an accident when I was drinking that prevents me from working. I live in a state where they refuse disability for everyone who doesn't have a lawyer. I'm trying to get back into college, but last fall I relapsed and I owe that school money because I didn't finish the semester so they charged me instead of using my Pell Grant. They won't release my transcripts until I pay them, and my new school won't approve financial aid without that transcript. I have a daughter that I can't talk to anymore, a family who is tired of helping me, and a will mired with failure after failure. I know that drinking doesn't help, and now it won't even let me escape. I honestly don't see how my situation can improve. I try to stay positive, but it's not working. I don't know what I expect by posting this, but my therapist encourages me to be more vocal. I feel defeated. I don't want to go on. On the bright side, I won't be drinking over it. I'm not even good at alcoholism. I guess that if anyone reads this and is feeling similarly, know that you don't have to pick up today. If I can get to sleep sober, so can you.",

   "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI just passed 6 months a couple days ago and I am so relieved to tell you that for all the complaining and worrying I have done up until this point, sobriety is starting to feel normal. \n\nThe first few months I felt like I was \"faking\" recovery. I felt deep down that I was an alcoholic and that naturally at some point I would return to the booze because that's who I was. My identity was so intertwined with drugs and alcohol that I couldn't even begin to imagine what life would look like without it. \n\nLuckily, what I'm beginning to see as I hit half a year away from it all is that the longer you stay sober, the better acquainted you become with that part of you. The addict part of me, the passionate, angry, self-destructive, crazy silly shit disturber is still there. And that was a relief honestly, because I didn't want to lose myself entirely in this transition. That energy is just channeled into healthier outlets, like painting and yoga and sex and dancing. \n\nI remember saying at one of my first AA meetings that I wasn't sure I could continue staying sober because alcohol hadn't ruined my life (aka I hadn't hit rock bottom), so it felt like I was giving up so much for so little in return. A man replied that the thing about sobriety is that it just keeps getting better, and there's no way to describe what it can give you, you just have to experience it. At the time I thought that was a load of shit but as it turns out he was right. Everything in my life seems to have gotten better even though the only thing that changed was my decision to stay sober. \n\nEvery day I feel more and more free. I was completely trapped by alcohol but also tricked by it into thinking it was the only way I could ever be happy. I couldn't have been more wrong. ",

   "selftext": "I never truly though I had an issue with alcohol. Writing that sentence brings tears to my eyes because I knew I had a problem, it was just easier to act as if I was fine. So many bad things have happened in my life because of alcohol. I've ruined numerous relationships and I also got a DUI almost 4 years ago. I am happily married now, thankfully. \nI had a big wake up call this past week that has cost me a lot. Money, rank and my personal free time. My husband would barely even talk to me and told me that now is the time to stop drinking. He is stationed in Guam right now and I will be able to go around August. I agreed with him 100%. I made a very stupid, selfish decision that has affected both of us. I said it was a wake up call. He said it is THE wake up call. \nHe still doesn't think I'm an alcoholic because I'm not dependent on alcohol. But I do binge drink. When I drink I DRINK. He still wants me to stop drinking for a while and I agree. I would hate to ruin my marriage over a drink. It's not worth it and now I see that. I'm mad at myself that it took this happening for me to understand. Hindsight is 20/20 I guess. \nThings are very stressful right now. I am trying to make it through these next 2 months but I know it's going to be very difficult. I am lucky I have my husband to support me. I know he loves me unconditionally. This is going to be a big test in our relationship. I hope we can recover from this together. \nI am done drinking. ",

   "selftext": "Alcohol redeemed the workday for me, gave me a reason to look forward to just... SOMETHING about the day.\n\nI know there are TONS of things to look forward to. I will lose the weight I gained from drinking 1200+ calories a day. I will feel better in the morning. Overall, I'll sleep better. I won't need to stop at the liquor store or worry if the people there think I'm an alcoholic. I won't need to hide bottles. My health will be better. My brain and liver will thank me. I will focus better. Less mind-fog. SO many things.\n\nBut the one thing I do not feel a sense of right now - and the FIRST thing to end my sobriety, every time - is that I don't feel like I have anything to look forward to. I don't have a way to get that relaxation/mild euphoria at the end of the day. The things I enjoyed while drinking, mainly video games, don't hold my attention while sober anymore.\n\nThere's just no pleasure to look forward to. I'm indifferent and bored at best, lonely and full of dread at worst. I don't know how to accept that I can't have that touch of numbing pleasure at the end of every day. How fucking greedy does that sound? I'm trying. Yesterday, I went home and just cried, and I tried to just... accept what I was feeling. Tried to accept that sometimes I'm just going to be miserable. Today I took a different route and tried to teach myself how to find normal pleasure again. I went to Panera and got a nice meal and have been writing, which is a passion of mine, but I have to force it. There's fleeting moments of enjoyment but mostly I'm just trying to convince myself that this is fun and that I feel good... but I don't think I really do.\n\nI've come so far... I've told people, I've gone to dozens of CR meetings and a few AA, I've put reminders around my apartment about why this is worth it. I post here. I've done everything I thought I was supposed to do. I've put up every defense I know how to put up against drinking. Yet I'm still so, so scared I'm going to fail. So scared that something so simple as \"lack of pleasure\" is going to be what ruins my streak again.\n\nI even went through search and found TONS of posts about this exact thing, and I'm trying to convince myself this won't last forever, but right now, in the heat of it, it feels like it will. The very worst thing about this for me - it's not the night sweats, the irritability (as I once thought it was), the anxiety, the FOMO. The very worst thing is going through my day knowing I don't have that feel-good feeling to look forward to at the end of the day anymore.\n\nI feel like such a wuss that THIS is what's causing me to struggle right now, but I don't know what to do. I have all my armor on and I feel like if the moment hits me at the wrong time, I'm going to end up drinking before my lizard brain gives me a chance to remember why I'm STOPPING.\n\nI don't want to drink. I'm not going to drink tonight. I'll hate myself for it. After as much as I've worked myself up to STOPPING, how many different resources I have put in my toolbox over the last few months... when will I ever be as strong as I am now? I prepared myself for this, and if I can't do this, it'll be months or years before I can get even a few days under my belt again. I KNOW all of this and I'm still so scared I'll fail. ",

Today she wrote about being a guest on a morning tv show and being asked how much she used to drink. The quote above is how she wished she'd answered after thinking about it later. She also said \"The truth is that yes, sometimes I drank far more than two bottles in a night. But sometimes I only had two glasses. The effect was the same. I felt varying degrees of physical sickness the morning after, but always, always, always I felt anxiety. Shame. And this deep knowing that I was blotting out my own existence.\" This really spoke to me. I feel terrible anxiety, shame and depression after I drink no matter how many or few I have. It's not worth it to me to drink even 1 - the result is the same. I will remember her quote when I feel weak. I need to remember what happens after I drink. I never want to feel that way again.

I've lost 4 jobs in a year but as a result of disgusting manipulation and an awesome early-life resume to constantly fall back on, I've somehow managed to keep getting hired. I kick ass initially and make a good first impression and then the CA kicks in and I fuck it all up. Thing is, I had an awesome childhood, wealthy family, great education, tons of friends, adequate attention from the fairer sex, and yet here I am just drowning myself in a bottomless well of self-pity and misery. \n\nLong and short of it is I feel like I don't deserve to be an alcoholic. And not in the sense of \"I don't deserve this terrible affliction of alcoholism,\" but more \"there are people so much worse off than me that need alcohol to cope with everyday life and you are not one of them you POS spoiled fuck.\"\n\nAnyone comprende or can relate?

   "selftext": "Not sure how this works. I had affairs on my wife( I don\u2019t like addressing her as such). Pardon my grammar also :(  let\u2019s back this up to the very beginning. I came from a messed up family...if you could call it a family....fml. I was 5 and witnessed my dad die. He was crying out for his medicine...my mom left him to suffer and die. Let\u2019s back it up some more. My mom was emotionally and physically abused as a child and ran away from home. She met my dad when he was 50 and she was 20. He took her in and they had my sister and I. During the 5 years she was again physically and emotionally abused by my dad. He was morbidly obese, alcoholic, and diabetic. His final days were spent in bed super dependent on his shot and heart medicine. Fast forward to after death where my vulture relatives from his first family came to our house and took everything. Fast forward some more where my mom becomes alcoholic and abusive of me and my sister. I was 11 when she beat my sister and dragged her my her hair. My sister grabs my dads revolver and points it at her then me and then at herself. She runsaway multiple times. I couldn\u2019t take it. The abuse is emotionally and physically wrecking me. I leave to work construction but still go to school. I met a 37yr old chick that thought I was adorable and moved in with her. She was married but told her husband I was her sons friend (didn\u2019t even know her son) and I was homeless so she said I could stay. Her son was cool. He called me dad and we smoked pot and worked construction together. Her husband didn\u2019t know I was sleeping with her. I was with her till I graduated high school. By then I met this girl. She was really familiar. Turns out we went to elementary school together. We hook up during high school but she starts talking to other dudes so we broke up. I hook up with another girl. We get a place together and live ok I guess. I was out shopping with her and run into my high school gf. I felt claws rip into my skin as I got nervous and didn\u2019t introduce my current gf as such. It was awkward. She totally cheats on me even after I buy her a car, get her a place stay loyal...lol jokes on me yet again. She dumps me on top of me catching her cheating. I get my own place and again run into my high school gf. This time we talk a bit. She is living with her dude. I pursue her a bit and we fool around. Didn\u2019t know what the hell I walked into. I get a call....\u201dI\u2019m pregnant and it\u2019s yours....your the only guy I was with.\u201d Now this is where me being a man about it tell her ok and I\u2019m stepping up. I\u2019m making good money but living a reckless lifestyle. I wanted to settle down. Have a family. I quit using cocaine. Quit smoking pot. Quit drinking heavily. I was on the straight and narrow. I buy her everything. Crib, clothes, appliances, changing station, boxes and boxes and boxes of pampers, boxes of formula, bottles and bottle cleaning supplies, everything you could think of for a newborn I had bought. I went by her apt and got there early....too early. Just in time to see this dude walk out her apt. She\u2019s 9 months pregnant and I\u2019m seeing a guy leave her apt. I doubt myself but ask her who the guy was. \u201cAn old friend \u201c. Yeah I guess. The doubt is there but isn\u2019t enough to keep me from being excited about my child that\u2019s days from being born. Go to the hospital. I\u2019m there in the operating room. I see the baby, it\u2019s s girl! Yay! I was so fucking happy! I fell in love. My heart sank as the doctors saw the umbilical cord in a \u201ctrue knot\u201d. They cut the cord and rushed my little baby girl off. My heart sank further. :( Minutes felt like eternity. The doctors come back and tell me she has a spot in her kidney and there might be developmental issues as blood wasn\u2019t circulated for an unknown time. I was devastated. Her mom was in the recovery room. We hadn\u2019t come up with a name yet. The dr comes in and asks if we are married. Nope. Not yet. The dr tells me I don\u2019t have any say so unless I sign the certificate. He then tells me if I want a paternity test as they can use the blood from the umbilical cord. She gets nervous and asks to talk to me. I have doubts. So I ask her again. She tells me this time that she wasn\u2019t sure if me or this other guy was the father. I felt like killing myself yet again. I was a mess but I knew if I were to walk away I would walk away from this precious little girl. I sign the certificate and refused the test. (I\u2019ll explain later). She names her, didn\u2019t even ask me:(\nMy little girl won\u2019t be able to come home until almost a month in the hospital undergoing testing and exams. Her mom tells me while I\u2019m at work that her dad wants to see the baby. Her father is in a state penitentiary for drugs. I told her absolutely not. I will not have my little girl in that decease infest shit hole....she takes her anyway. :( several years pass and i get us our first home. Several years of her also making me feel like I\u2019m not our little girl father. Me thinking it\u2019s possibly due to not marrying her I ask her. We get married. Still same shit. She doesn\u2019t let me make decisions. We have been married for 8 years. My little girl is 11 years old. I haven\u2019t been in love with her mom since forever. I had multiple affairs as i realize she was cheating on me like every other woman has in my life. I met my soulmate at work. She was the most amazing person I have ever met. She had a refreshing outlook. She was dorky and I loved it. She is very gorgeous too. I was falling in love with this woman. She has trouble at her parents and I move her in with me and my eh wife. We start having an affair. 3 years pass. I\u2019m not intimate with the wife for over 3 years. I am absolutely in love with my soulmate. Until she left me for Jesus Christ. She has always been into religion but I haven\u2019t. As a matter of fact I hated Him. She says she wants to pursue the Lord. I understand. I\u2019m still married too so I can understand the other reason for leaving. Fuck my life. Been thinking of killing myself and letting my little girl collect my life insurance. Sorry for the long ass rant. :( I thought this would help me. It hasn\u2019t. Fml",

I wish I never had to give up a day to have my wife take care of me for this.\n* Ignoring my son and wife. My son turned 1 about a month ago and I don't regret my goal of sobriety at all. I tried to quit drinking before he was born but I failed miserably. It wasn't until he came into my life that I began the long process of turning my life around to try to change everything.\n\nA year in to my very long process of staying sober and I can fully say that I love my son so much that I will never look at alcohol as a goal ever again. I still struggle with it as an addiction and I'm only about 15 days out from my last drink but a struggle with sobriety in between is better than the alternative.\n\nIt's been really painful to reverse my outlook, and a lot of meetings to AA seem like they aren't doing anything to my mind but they slowly help. My son is my goal, I need to spend time with him and enjoy my life with him. He makes me happier than I could ever ask for.\n\nI never discount my wife, and she always joins me in my recovery, but she knows that the one that defines my outlook is my son. It's not that I don't love my wife, she knows that my relationship with her has now been interlinked between our son and her and I. It's a fully committed family to me. She's my wife, he's my son. I want to exist for my son to teach him how to be. She's not always happy with my choices in life, but she joins me in trying to be smarter for our family. That sounds a lot like normal life.\n\nAlcohol still pops up in my mind but it immediately causes problems and my wife and my son help me to turn it around. I am not sober like I would like to be but I have the best support structure I could ask for. Even when I fail at sobriety I have a family who will join me again in my next attempt. My son doesn't know better but my wife does. My son just does a really damn good job at making me realize that I either die drinking or watch him grow up. I want to watch him grow up. \n\nAlbum of my motivation, because this guy makes my world better: https://imgur.com/a/zpTcWFH",

We each have kids from previous relationships and are family has blended together really well all the kids are excited about their new sister . So we found out she was pregnant a few months ago and with the hormones she has completely changed and basically hates me or so it seems. She kicks me out about once a week, for reasons like I comforted her wrong , another time I asked her if she was upset about something just minor things that get blown way up. Sunday morning we woke up and everything was great we laid in bed and cuddled and talked till about nine. My 11 year old who I only get one weekend a month because of distance was here for the weekend . My girlfriend decided to organize our room and I took her daughter and mine out to caribou and when we returned out of nowhere she flipped and started going off about how I never made my kids eat vegetables before I met her and now there is different rules for her kids and mine about eating vegetables. My kids eat the same vegetables at dinner that hers does so I don\u2019t understand but anyways it upset me that she seems to flip when I get my daughter, my daughter loves her and is a great kid. So after that mess I have to run my daughter home to her moms and when I get back home with my seven year old it was about ten at night. He shares a room with her five year old . I sent my son to bed right away , thirty seconds later her son comes out bawling saying my son says they can\u2019t watch YouTube videos in bed . That\u2019s a rule that my girlfriend and I implemented, my son wasn\u2019t rude at all just following rules. My girlfriend lost it saying that my kids don\u2019t get punished for anything and have no rules which is not true. She says she doesn\u2019t want to do this anymore and ends the relationship again. I am mentally exhausted and I have full custody of my seven year old so when I get kicked out at 11at night my son comes with. After she quit drinking I prayed that this would stop but has gotten worse since being pregnant, I clean , I pay the bills , I drive both of our kids to school and their activities but she still says I don\u2019t do anything that I promised. Sorry getting a little long winded , so as of Sunday she told me to only contact her about the baby. I am super hurt and have not responded to any of her texts or calls because of my anxiety and all the texts have been devaluing me and trying to instigate a reaction. Like I said she is wonderful but since being pregnant can\u2019t stand me. Any advice on how I could handle her better ? The consequences of whatever is going on her head have a huge affect on a lot of people\u2019s lives and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m strong enough to hang on anymore it\u2019s messing with my son.  Sorry it was so long and thanks guys for any advice . I have a lot of respect for you  ",

Every other time, something awful and embarrassing happened when I was drunk that prompted me to quit. This time, nothing particularly bad happened during my last drink, but it just dawned on me how screamingly obvious it was that I was an alcoholic (I was regularly getting blackout drunk alone pissing myself) and should stop drinking.\n\nI won't lie, I've been brutally depressed for the last two weeks. I usually hit a kind of depression around week 2 and that's usually when I relapse, with the rationale being: \"Well if I'm going to feel this awful I might as well drink since at least that gives me some momentary happiness.\" This time my thought process was completely different and I've had virtually no urge to drink. My thinking was: 'Well I know from bitter experience that drinking will just somehow make this worse so I'm definitely not doing that.' Something in me seems to have changed, it's weird. But I know I need to be careful of complacency. \n\nAnyway, thanks for all your support and your inspiring posts, I know I'm still at a very early stage but I'm feeling hopeful :) ",

   "selftext": "Hi guys, \n\nIn two days, I'll be 22 years old. I've decided I'm using that \\(somewhat unimportant\\) milestone to mark my shift into an abstinent lifestyle. My last drink was five days ago, and I made a total fool of myself. Blacked out, annoyed my friends, it wasn't pretty. And this has happened more times than I can count. \n\nI started drinking when I was 17, and directly from the beginning I had problematic tendencies when drinking. I kept telling myself I'm not an alcoholic, and maybe I'm actually not one, but labels don't matter, it's the way one behaves and how it affects one's life. I don't think I'm addicted to alcohol. For me, it is truly not difficult to stay sober. I've gone to bars before with friends and had no problem resisting the temptation to drink; knowing I had to drive home later. All no issue whatsoever. My problem? Moderation! I can't just have one or two drinks like most people. The moment I get started, I just want more and more without really noticing  \\(or caring\\) at what point enough is enough. This has led to me having more than my fair share of embarrassing memories while out with friends, and I'm tired of it. I can't tolerate it anymore. Every time I start drinking, there's about a 30&amp;#37; chance that I'll regret it the next day. Then when you consider drinking about once per week, that's another drunken embarrassment every month. All of my friends have their rare occassions of accidentally going a little too far and getting a little too drunk, but it happens to me signficantly more often than anyone else I know. \n\nUntil now, I've always made excuses for myself, so as to not hate myself more than I already do. Maybe I drink too much to drown out the sadness and self hatred caused by my Depression? Maybe I drink too much because I have Aspergers' Syndrome \\(a form of high\\-functioning autism\\) and I don't have the social capacity to know when enough is enough? Maybe I'm just addicted to alcohol and haven't realized it? Maybe my extensive family history of alcoholism has doomed me genetically to excessive drinking?....... All of these might be right or none of them, it's honestly anyone's guess. But the important part isn't what's causing this issue, but rather how I react to it. And I'm afraid the only logical thing to do is to swear off alcohol until further notice, but probably forever. The security is knowing that I always have complete control over my behavior is well worth sacrificing a little bit of fun when going out with friends. \n\nTo a certain extent I feel a bit sorry for myself that I can't just have a casual drink now and then like most people do; it's certainly a nice way to liven up a party or loosen up social inhibitions. But on the other hand I feel very lucky that making this decision to be abstinent is a relatively easy one that does not involve any pain or anxiety in my day to day life, as it does for so many members of this sub, who struggle day to day to stay sober; they have my deepest sympathy and respect. \n\nI don't know exactly what my intentions were in writing this, I guess I just wanted to tell someone about my decision. I haven't told my friends yet and I'm interested to see how they will react. ",

I\u2019ve had stomach issues my entire life (bloating, cramps, diarrhoea, constipation). During the first half of 2016 I had 3 separate instances where I'd gone out, had 1-3 alcoholic drinks, and then got this crazy intense stomach pain to the point where I ended up puking and feeling awful for hours afterward. During one of these instances, I got really dizzy, my arm went numb and my hand went into this weird position. I put that all down to stress though, as I was going through a tough time and it hasn't happened since.\n\nI\u2019ve also had reproductive issues. In 2005 I had a LEEP to remove low-grade dysplasia. I've had a good few abnormal smears since then, but eventually they come up normal after a repeated testing. I occasionally go through times where my periods will be really messed up (for instance, bleeding for 2 weeks at a time, or every 2 weeks). A few years ago I had an ultrasound and was told that I had PCOS. I was shown the \"pearl necklace\" on the ultrasound images. I never went on any medication for it. Around December 2016 I started getting intense uterine cramps before and after my period. Then they started to happen once a week. Eventually, I was getting them nearly every day. This all progressed over the course of 8 months. Eventually I had another ultrasound where they told me I didn\u2019t have PCOS. In September 2017 I had a laparoscopy to check for endometriosis, however they didn't find anything and my uterine cramps mysteriously stopped after that. \n\nIn January 2017, I began getting intermittent, but localised stomach pain. The pain is just to the left of my belly button. It's more like a persistent dull ache, but occasionally it can get really uncomfortable. It's really hard to predict when it's going to happen, but it's usually a few times a week and mainly happens during the day. Some times it can last all day, other times it's for an hour or so and then it calms down. Occasionally I'll have a good week where I don't get the pain at all.\n\nI've seen a Dr about this a few times, but they just put it down to IBS and refuse to send me to a specialist because my symptoms aren't bad enough. Is this something I should worry about or is most likely IBS?\n",

I also made a post a while ago, but I erased it because I got reemed out because I made it sound like a \"why am I stuck with this person\" thread. \n\n\nSo here it goes. My girlfriend is BP 2, but she said her diagnosis is Uni-polar ( I apologize for the misspelling. She does not get angry, but will suffer from bouts of depression and has anxiety. Besides taking a medicine for panic attacks, she was on Depakote and Seroquel. Now she is phasing out the Depakote for Trilictal and Geodon for Seroquel. As she is making this change, she is going through a tough time at work. \n\nSince January, her boss has been mean to say the least. She doesn't remember anything past interactions, often will verbally attack / criticize her, and will take days off without telling her.\n\n This has driven my girlfriend (BP 2) nuts and has caused her to be secluded on weekends, just sitting on the couch coloring in her adult coloring book, watching TV, and sometimes over eating a bit.\n\nI have been going to therapy with her for the past two months. It is helping, but we've both noticed that I may need therapy because my past has been traumatic (lots of bullying as a kid, both physiological and physical). \n\nRecently, I've been looking for jobs her to apply to, while dealing with grad school issues, work issues, trying to be there and comforting for her, all while trying to maintain a clean condo.\n\nI'm not sure if any of your SO's tend to be lackadaisical or absent minded, but mine can have a tendency to be that way when she gets depressed. This is what kinda grinds my gears a bit. \n\nI'm a neat freak. Since she has moved in, I've loosened my grip on the neat freakiness because she can be a little messy. She doesn't leave food out, but she will leave cups of half emptied coffee out on the living room, along with half emptied water bottles. She will also leave stuff in the sink, not make the bed (I can't in the morning because I leave for work before she gets up sometimes), hasn't done laundry in weeks, leaves piles of clothes everywhere, and doesn't help me with vacuuming and cleaning. We've talked about getting a cleaning lady, but she needs to put some jewelry  a way first before doing so. She hasn't done that either. \n\nShe has helped pay for cable, some grocery bills (she doesn't come with me to the store), and half the quarterly tax bills.  That's fine and all, but she needs to help me a tad more and trying to get her do so in this state has been problematic. \n\nI've been comforting and understanding. I'll sit with her and converse about her day and how she is feeling, comforting her. I haven't asked for her help in weeks because the last time I did, I got the response of \"I can't when all my energy is used in compartmentalizing my work day\" or \"I'm too depressed to do anything. I'm sorry\". \n\nThis morning, we had an argument because I mentioned it passing that I did some cleaning, which seemed to trigger her. We argued and she was upset that I padded her butt to wake up her up this morning as I was getting ready to go. This leads into an argument of where I mention that I could use help, reprieve, and that I deal with students yelling back at me and being disrespectful. I don't need to deal with more yelling. I'm having a hard time of keeping it together. I need some help around here because I work two jobs and will have grad class soon. \n\nShe says she understands, but is in a very depressive state and can't help me.  She also says thank you for the help in the job search, but I can't do it right now. \n\nI'm trying to help her out of this hell hole she got into. I'm also looking for her to help me keep our place a little more tidier. Are there any phrases or words that I can use to get her see my way and do some tiding up while in this depressive state? I feel like I'm drowning. \n\n",

DHA, vitamin D, reishi mushroom and Lion\u2019s Mane to try to help normalize my brain again. Oh and matcha tea, breathing exercises, and cold showers (Wim Hof method.) I am looking forward to getting started with actually realizing the potential that was locked inside me all these years while only the alcoholism got to express itself. \n\nSo yeah this past weekend was a harsh setback and it hurt but I landed in a better place, I think, and a lot of the good work I did before the slip-up in terms of getting my life together (meaning the little things like cleaning and organizing, getting my car serviced, having my teeth cleaned, playing board games with my kids, etc that don\u2019t happen when your major agenda in life is getting wasted and passing out) is all still in place. \n\n",

   "selftext": "I stopped drinking alcohol a bit more than a year ago, after a living a highly functioning alcoholic life for a good 20 years - most of my adult life. I know now that I have never had a better time than those last months; I am my own master, reasonable, healthy, calm, friendly; and finally free of permanent guilt! I am conscious, I actively feel the good and the bad in my life, I meditate, I go to AA and other group meetings regularly and this enriches everything I am. I *never* want to go back to who and where I was when I was drinking. I was quite lucky to be able to stop cold turkey and not once have had a drink since, and rarely any cravings. I am in many ways in peace with my own existence, I am happy that I became from an drinker to an recovering alcoholic.\n\nBut still it never stops: Sometimes, there is a voice in my head, my own voice, and it tells me things like: \u2018Tonight, you could have a few glasses, man. There is nobody home and you might relax a bit better, maybe see the movie a bit deeper or feel the music a bit more intense. If you don\u2019t overdo it, you\u2019ll be fine.\u2019\n\nAnd I know, the voice is right! The music does touch me deeper when I am pissed and the movie is more interesting in that moment. And when I don\u2019t overdo it, I\u2019ll be fine. Problem is: I will forget most of the movie and get distracted from my music by something stupid like writing a simple email. And for sure, I will overdo it. Of course! Sooner or later. If not this time, then next time. Which will inevitably come when I start again today. I will hurt myself or break my phone, yell in McDonald\u2019s or start a fight with the police. My wife will immediately know and my kids will be endlessly disappointed. I could also lose my license or my job, my family or even my life. I don\u2019t want to drink because of all this.\n\nNevertheless, there is this voice; sometimes. It is not a loud voice, and it doesn\u2019t speak up all the time. On most of my days I am blessed with not a thought about alcohol. And when I hear it, I know it is talking nonsense. I know all the good things about not drinking. But I have to actively make an effort to tell them to myself. The voice though, it comes by itself. It pretends to be me, be my friend. When in a good mood, I can laugh about it, because I know how absurd it would be: I cannot drink \u2018a little\u2019. Or \u2018only today\u2019. And what alcoholic wants to drink \u20182 or 3 beer only\u2019, anyway? \n\nI did so many stupid things while drunk, it\u2019s a surprise I can sit here and write this, with my head, my limbs and all my organs still intact, with a family that supports me and a job that pays our bills well. I am thankful for this and of course I can only feel this grateful since I stopped drinking. If I was drinking I would be rude, rough and feel entitled and I\u2019d give a shit about thankfulness.\n\nBut I want to stay happy. And because I know how it is going to end, I will not drink. I will not end this beautiful life without drama, without hangovers, fear, anxiety and regret. There is no end in sight for this, although this voice never seems to fully disappear. I hear it, but I will not listen to it. \n\nI will not drink with you today.",

   "selftext": "Hello!  I'm not sure how much of this is even in my power, but I need some advice on how I can help my ex-boyfriend quit drinking (who is still my friend, and we hook up sometimes... probably not smart but...).  And I guess I need to vent a little.\n\nWe dated for a little over a year, a few months of which was long distance.  We are in our mid twenties and our friends party a lot (but have their lives together for the most part), so at the time I didn't fully realize how bad his drinking was.  He always had beer or whiskey with him - in his truck, in his hoodie pocket, at my house, at his house.  He would wake up in the morning with shaking hands and always wanted to crack a beer first thing, which drove me nuts.  When he was really drunk, he had a tendency to get super dark and be combative - never mean to me or physically abusive, but would talk about things like wanting to kill himself, and nothing I could say or do would turn his mood around.  I never knew how seriously to take this which was extremely stressful.  His older brother is an alcoholic and has actually been to jail because of it, and lost his wife because of it, and still hasn't gotten any better.  They are both living at home right now, and I have encouraged my ex to move out many times because I think his brother is toxic to be around.\n\nHe would drive drunk (not blacked out, to my knowledge, but definitely over the legal limit) and would even drink beer while driving, despite knowing how uncomfortable this made me.  This caused our biggest fight - I had been out of the country for nearly 4 months, and we had only seen each other for a wedding that we attended the day after I got back.  \n\nHe was working as a rafting guide at the time (and has pretty much always done seasonal, outdoor rec jobs - a lifestyle that is heavy on drinking), and I spent half a day getting down to where he was living.  We had been together for about an hour, when we decided to go check out this tourist site.  When we were going inside, he had two beers in his pocket and I told him I didn't want him to bring them inside, that we could drink beer once we get back into town.  He refused and so I refused to get out of the truck, and he went in without me.  When he came back, we silently drove back to town and he dropped me at my car, where we got in a huge fight.  He kept insisting that it was my fault for being mad and ruining the visit over \"just a beer\".  I told him that it felt like he was choosing beer over spending time with me.  He said he's a grown man and can do what he wants.  I left and drove home and didn't see him again for about a month.\n\nAfter that fight we went on a break, saw each other a little, and then finally did break up a few months ago.  But lately we have been on and off again hooking up, and are still friends.  I know that our relationship was toxic to me, but I do care about him and I know he's a good person.  I want to help him, but I feel like I spent our entire relationship being a support system to him, meanwhile I was rarely getting the support and love that I needed.  I don't understand addiction at all because I have never struggled with it, or seen a family/friend struggle with it aside from him.\n\nI don't know what to do.  I don't know if there's even anything I can do, until he decides to get help for himself.  Is it bad that we even see each other?  Should I cut that off until he gets help?  Do I need to give up and move on entirely?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.",

   "selftext": "Hi guys.\n\nI'm pretty stuck right now and don't really have anyone to reach out to. I am a 19 year old girl in college. I am paying for everything myself. I grew up in an abusive home: my dad is a dead beat alcoholic living off welfare, my mom wasn't in my life, and my grandma is a narcissistic cult leader. \n\nI haven't received a penny of help from anyone. I am currently paying for my living arrangement and college. Finals are coming up in a week and if I do not get all A's in my classes I will not be able to go to college next semester. I'm trying to study, but I can't focus. I have no plan B.\n\nI'm currently in a relationship with my 24 year old boyfriend who is bipolar. Our relationship is falling apart. Somehow, I seem to trigger his bipolar episodes every day because I am defensive. No matter how hard I try to not be defensive, I apparently do it and set him off. I am walking on eggshells.\n\nLately, there has been a lot of repressed memories from my childhood coming up. Molestation. Physical abuse. Mental abuse. Emotional abuse. I knew it happened, but I didn't realize I suppressed so much. I'm beginning to feel like I will explode with rage or sadness, and that is not like me. I am a very mellow person.\n\nI took lsd for therapy a few days ago. I understand that lsd has a reputation as a dumb drug, but it is actually an efficient way of getting rid of depression. It helped me for a while, but my boyfriend and his anxiety and constant fighting has brought me back to where I was. \n\nI saw my mom for the first time in ten years in Dec. It was a beautiful and overwhelming experience. Now, she is the only family member who has my back. This is wonderful, but I barely know her. I feel so displaced. I have no one I can actually run to.\n\nI spent so much time trying to help my boyfriend this year that I did not have time to focus much on making friends of my own. I dropped everything to make sure that he was okay. I have no one to talk to. I can't talk to him because I am afraid I will trigger his bipolar rage. I even let my grades slip for him. Yet, at the same time, none of my efforts were good enough for him.\n\nMy life seriously sucks. I don't know how to get out of this cycle. I just want to be happy. I want to get rid of this baggage. I don't know where to turn next, as I feel as though every route I have is hopeless. \n\nOn top of that, Im hardly getting any sleep at night because of my boyfriend's sleeping schedule and my insomnia. My anxiety is through the roof. I am so alone.\n\nI apologize for this confusing mishmash of words. My mind is so jumbled. Does anyone have any advice for me?",

   "selftext": "**TLDR: I am a cam girl and I am questioning whether or not it is ethical for me to continue agreeing to indulge a submissive client with questionable mental capabilities.**\n\nSome background: I have been a cam girl for six years now and have supported myself through that exclusively. Clients who want to be submissive are fairly run-of-the-mill, and even the ones who want to be financially dominated (eg. blackmail roleplay or simply demanding money from them) are pretty common and appear not to spend more money than most other clients. Most of them clearly have day jobs, their own limits on how much they are willing to spend or willing to do, and generally seem to think of cam sites as a fun extracurricular activity. Even the ones who use cam sites in what I personally might think is an unhealthy manner tend to only stay on the site or on one single cam girl for a few months at most.\n\nThen there's the client I am concerned about. I'll call him Frank. He started out seemingly like any other sub who wanted to be dominated. He enjoyed being humiliated and it seemed that he also enjoyed me demanding money from him, so that's what I did. He has been my customer for 3 or 4 years now. In the past year he has become far more interested in more frequent communication (sending Emails through the site's inbox service) and sending longer messages. He has also been on the site almost any time that he is not at work.\n\nHe is in his late thirties, and while I'm not qualified to make a statement on what level he is writing at, it clearly is not what it should be. He doesn't seem to know how to spell, there are run-on sentences and no apparent structure or flow to anything he writes. It is all very disorganized. I am not a professional but if I had to guess, from some of the stuff he says, I think he might be mentally impaired, or at the very least perhaps he has a low IQ. He has also talked about being depressed, having contemplated suicide in the past (he said that he does not feel he is at risk of doing it in the near or foreseeable future though,) and he has trouble maintaining friendships and work relationships. He is often impulsive (he wouldn't disagree with that statement,) but doesn't seem to see what is wrong with that, he is a dangerous driver by his own account. He also says that his license is currently suspended but he drives anyway. He said he used to be an alcoholic but he doesn't drink any more. He gets frustrated with and mouthy to his bosses (he works in a kitchen and appears to change jobs very frequently.) Overall, he seems like he might have some sort of cognitive disability and have issues with impulse control. He also seems not to realize this or understand why exactly these things cause him problems. He has also said that he is not close with his family, although he has a few friends that he sees on occasion. He has also been in trouble with HR and his boss time and time again.\n\nTo be clear: Money is not the issue here, at least on my end. If he stopped logging on tomorrow I'd still be fine financially so it's not so much a question of \"This feels wrong but I need the money\" as much as it is \"I'm not sure if this is wrong but either way I don't know the best course of action at this point.\"\n\nHe told me about a year ago that he stopped enjoying financial domination as much and he would prefer to be dominated in other ways, so I stopped with the financial domination. He keeps sending very large tips though, and I'm not sure how I feel about accepting money from someone who has such trouble taking care of themselves, works in a kitchen so probably doesn't earn very much, is impulsive, and might be mentally challenged. I know this sounds ridiculous but even though this had been on my mind for a while, what prompted me to write this post was that I had started reading *Flowers for Algernon* and the \"Progress Reports\" written by the protagonist in the beginning of the book reminded me so much of Frank's letters that it really got to me.\n\nUp until now I have tried to make lemons out of lemonade here. I have made a habit of \"dominating\" him in ways that I think would help him, like commanding him to adjust his diet in healthier ways, set aside money for himself, patch things up with coworkers, keep a journal, exercise lightly, and hopefully I'll think of more. He knows that is exactly what I am doing, so it isn't like I'm pulling one over on him or anything.\n\nShould I completely cut off contact with this person? Should I talk to him and tell him maybe he should be working on himself rather than spending money on cam girls? Clearly his cam site use is unhealthy, but it seems like everything else in his life is as well, and it is not obvious to me that quitting camming would fix any of it, or even that he has the capacity and the support system to improve his own life. To add to that, he is in his late thirties and supporting himself. Even if his life isn't what it could be, he *is* a grown man taking care of himself and on some level it seems like I don't have a place to tell him otherwise (beyond what he is okay with and specifically asks for, obviously.)\n\nThoughts? Suggestions? How should one navigate this?\n\n**Edit/Update: Was not expecting this to blow up so big. Thanks for all the comments, everybody. To clarify: I am never \"off the clock\" talking to this person. The relationship is strictly professional in the sense that we only chat on this one web site alone, and it is not unusual for clients on cam sites to want to talk to the cam girls about their personal issues. I'm guessing the reason for that is that it is less expensive and also less clinical-feeling than seeing a therapist, even though most cam girls are obviously not qualified to give the sort of help a therapist would. I think for many it serves a similar function to when someone wants to vent on Reddit about their personal life. They'd rather not talk to people they know about whatever is bothering them, so a cam girl seems like a good option. Singling this one person out as someone not allowed to do that doesn't seem entirely fair to me. After reading all of your comments, I have decided that the best thing for me to do is to continue encouraging this person to work on himself and to prompt him to improve his life in other ways so that he'll be better equipped to take care of himself and enjoy life when I eventually stop camming, and ideally sooner than that. As a grown man taking care of himself who might not necessarily have all his shit together, he of course knows he can stop at any point, and I've made clear to him many times that he is still welcome to chill in my free chat even if he never spends another dime. That is probably a fairly anti-climactic ending, so sorry about that, but to see all of you guys caring so much about this is really heartwarming. It's nice to see so many good people. :-D**",

I don\u2019t know if our fights are actual fights about something I should take to heart because I love this person or if he\u2019s being manipulative. Maybe I\u2019m also being manipulative towards him? I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s up or down, left or right when I\u2019m with him. When I\u2019m by myself or with friends or family I feel normal enough, no fights or arguments but I have found myself to be more opinionated and assertive, to the point where even if I\u2019m not being attacked, that\u2019s the response I give. Maybe I\u2019ve always been like this and people have just coddled me and have been nice to me? or maybe I\u2019m now feeling edgy because of the situation I\u2019m in with my husband? He calls me names, tells me \u201cI\u2019m always right, and he\u2019s always wrong\u201d in a mocking way, sometimes in a defeatist way. I just can\u2019t get a straight answer out of him. I feel like he\u2019s gaslighting me at times about arguments or dumb chores that he did and I didn\u2019t do even though I did them. Or food I actually made but he\u2019ll say he made? But then he says I\u2019m gaslighting him when I get annoyed that he isn\u2019t telling the truth. \n\nI\u2019m doubting myself and our relationship a lot which has made me feel incredibly anxious at work and in my close relationships. I don\u2019t want to talk to anyone that\u2019s close because I cherish that time with them where I\u2019m not stressed or worried about him and how he makes me feel. I feel like I\u2019ve become the nagging wife to him too, which is not something I\u2019ve EVER wanted to become. On top of all his health issues (diabetes, gastroparesis, sleep apnea) at 33 where I tried so hard to support him and his new diets, etc I\u2019m now just so tired of cooking and trying to keep on top of it all. I don\u2019t think he takes his pills, he never goes to his doctors, he refuses to go to any therapy or counseling, he hasn\u2019t been to a full week of work in over a year. He got a DUI back in 2014, went to  court ordered outpatient therapy which seemed to help him but he\u2019s fallen back to drinking. The quantity and frequency has gone down, but it still happens. Writing this out it seems even clearer he\u2019s digging himself a hole but no matter how much pleading, yelling, bargaining I will ever do with him he won\u2019t help himself. I don\u2019t want to say I\u2019m at an impasse because I honestly don\u2019t want to give up. There is plenty I love about him but the big stuff, the stuff that really matters seems broken. We\u2019ve been together since 2005, got married in 2015, no kids but I want them at some point soon...but geez do I want them with him? Everything about me wants to say yes, but that deep voice inside me says \u201cno\u201d, how could I with our relationship like this? but if \u201cno\u201d, then what? Our lives are so wrapped up in each other it is soul crushing to think of leaving, but I feel like my soul is being crushed by staying. Is it my fault? Is it his? I can\u2019t tell anymore and I\u2019m not sure who or what to trust. ",

In a way it was a meeting before the meeting, and he needed it.\n\nA brief explanation -to my mind a meeting does not have to take place in a church basement.  It can be two alcoholics connecting in the bread aisle of the supermarket, or at a coffee shop.  It can last a couple of minutes, or, as in this case, the forty five minutes it took to drive to our destination. His wife is very sick, she is a terrible patient, she provokes him, he regrets his outbursts...\n\nIn science fiction movies one often transports to another universe by passing through something like a giant soap bubble.  Not so in prison, it's stop, show ID, names recorded on clipboard and notebook, gates open and close - going through metal detectors in an area called the port sally, getting our get out of jail free cards and surrendering our keys and outside ID, more gates, and then a short ride in a battered van to the building where the 'programs' are held.\n\nAnd then - like the science fiction movie - poof we're in the alternate universe.  With people just like ourselves...\n\nThe leader last night picked a reading from a staple book in AA called Living Sober (pdf versions can be found online)  - He chose the chapter \"Easy Does It\" which goes directly against the alcoholic super power of \"I gotta get all this done immediately, and perfectly\".\n\nFrom the reading *\"The slogan \"Easy Does If is one way we  AA's remind each other that many of us have tendencies at times to overdo things, to rush heedlessly along, impatient with anything that slows us down. We find it hard to relax and savor life.\"* \n\nThis morphed into a topic of letting ourselves get bent out of shape when someone or something gets in the way of doing what we want to do.  (this happens a lot in prison)  someone else is on the phone - or a correction officer decides this is the time to enforce ALL the rules.  Space is rented in heads, molehills become mountains with international expeditions wearing oxygen tanks as they struggle upwards.... \n\npreachybit/ **there is so much more to recovery than not drinking - though that is of course the required starting point. Our thinking - our whole system of coping - is thrown into disarray. We no longer need a Bureau of Lies and Evasion in our heads** (the source of some of our 'superpowers') - and that releases a lot of energy which is not always put to good use /preachybit\n\nOne man shared on how he'd avoided drama this week by simply not responding to someone who was clearly looking to start something - over nothing.  \"I used to live for such moments, not that I needed an excuse to get into an argument, but if one came along I sure would run with it.\"   Easy Does it at work.\n\nTowards the end of the chapter it says *\"When we do find ourselves up-tight and even frantic, we can ask ourselves occasionally, \"Am I really that indispensable?\" or \"Is this hurry really necessary?\" What a relief to find the honest answer is frequently no!\" and ... \"How much does it really matter?\" is a very good question.\"* \n\nPreachybit2/ my warped, damaged, leaky self esteem was at the core of my alcoholism - and my knee jerk response was often do inflate it making my 'missions' far more important and urgent than they had to be - making me and those I was bumping against unhappy or angry.  Today Easy Does It - helps me a lot./preachybit2\n\nThere was less need for yet another \"meeting\" on the ride home  but as my friend was getting out of my car and into his truck, I called out \"Take care or yourself too, my friend.\"  He said he was going to go fishing tomorrow.\n\n",

Yesterday was so bad I waited until later in the afternoon to post in the daily check-in thread because I didn't want to make the pledge and then renege on it later.\n\nI live really close to a liquor store, so it's really never too far out of the way no matter which way I drive (I've seen some tips from people on here about changing your way home from work, etc, to avoid going by a liquor store). Yesterday, on the way home from Wal-Mart, I was really feeling the urge to go to the liquor store but I started talking to my wife about how I always lose weight when I stop drinking for a bit and that really seemed to settle the urge. \n\nI had to go back out again to take my daughter to the dentist, and once again I felt the urge to go to the liquor store, but I didn't.\n\nOnce we were home, we had dinner and I assumed we were in for the evening, and I felt relief at knowing I'd beaten my urges for one more day.\n\nAnd then my wife and daughter both talked me into going back to Wal-Mart for a few things. I tried to talk them out of it, because the first thing that entered my mind was that if we went back out I could just swing by the liquor store on the way home...\n\nBut we went back out and I was thinking about that damn liquor store for almost the entire time we were out.\n\nHappy ending time: I managed to make it home without a trip to the liquor store. Until I pulled in front of my house and shut the car off, I wasn't 100% sure I was going to make it. But I did, and I feel great this morning. \n\nI used to tell myself I wasn't really an alcoholic because I didn't feel what I always assumed were the same urges that other alcoholics must feel. I mean, I don't typically spend all day thinking about when I'm going to get my next drink (I actually think a lot more about drinking when I'm trying to stop than when I'm not). I'm fully capable of going without for a few days if I have certain practical reasons for not drinking (really important days at work, trips out of town, etc). And I don't go through many, if any, withdrawal symptoms when I stop (except I think the slight headaches I have for about a week afterwards are probably mild withdrawal).\n\nBut, man.

My dad's been an alcoholic my entire 31 years of life.  He'll be 59 years old tomorrow.  I now live in FL, my dad is living in my home state of WI.  His alcoholism has gotten to the point where he is on the verge of death and I don't know what to do.  I'm very scared and worried.\n\nHe wont listen to me.  My ex girlfriends dad had nowhere to stay, so my dad let him crash at his house.  My ex's dad had to leave because the house smelled bad of feces/urine and he couldn't stand it, he'd rather be homeless than live with him. \n\nMy ex told me that her dad told her that my dad... Drinks, sleeps for a few hours, drinks, sleeps for a few hours, drinks...etc. I was also told that he looks like he \"weighs 80 pounds, if that\", urinates and has bowel movements in his clothes, he doesn't eat for a week, he hasn't showered in months, my dog of 14 years old+ is also living with my dad and the dog is puicking/pooping/peeing all over the house and is eating her own poop.  Was also told he uses a bucket to pee, and has a rash/bumps all over his body (probably from not showering)\n\nI called my dad early this morning and we talked for 17 minutes. He just woke up so he was more towards the sober side, but still drunk.  He told me that he's fine and not to worry. He said he's 140 pounds (very doubtful) and that he had a half a sub to eat yesterday and 2 fish sandwhiches and a big mac the day before. He said that a week ago he didn't eat at all because he wasn't hungry. He did tell me that his legs are week and he hasn't done laundry in a long time because hes to weak to walk downstairs to do laundry.  He also said that when he drinks he doesn't care if he pees himself, or doesn't care if the dog goes to the bathroom all over the house.  He said the house does stink.  He said he has cream for the rash and not to worry.  I told him \"dad you're going to die if you don't care of yourself\" he said he doesn't care, everyone dies.\n\nBut I am worried.  Of course, he is my father!  He's been in rehab a few times years ago and we even had him committed in the past one time.  He was sober for a few months, then started right back up again.  At this point, i don't know if that'd help him.  He's literally drinking himself to death.  If he quits drinking it'll kill him because he's so dependent on it, and if he continues to drink it'll kill him.  \n\nI don't know what to do.  I told him he needs to go to the doctor, he said no.  Told him he needed to think about put my dog down because shes obviously getting sick/old age...he said no that's cruel.  My dad told me in the past that once the dog dies, he will kill himself.  He's tried to kill himself in the past, mostly just saying he was for attention, but one time he actually cut his wrists (with a dull blade and just needed a few stitches)\n\nHe is obviously very sick.  I messaged his two sisters and told them about what's been going on and asked if they could go check on him. I  Hoping for a reply that they will do so. I really can't afford to fly up there just to get an ''i'm fine, don't worry\".  I can't afford it and my work is short staffed and i'd probably be fired if i go. I do not want to believe that hes down to 80lbs, if that's the case, he will be dead any day.  I was thinking about calling the cops for a well being check, but i don't know if they'd do anything.  Sure maybe they'll lock him up on a 72hour hold at the hospitals' psych ward, MAYBE, but probably not.  I've called the police MANY times on him when i was living at home and they really didn't do anything.  He's been to detox, gets out and drinks.  He was sober for a few months in the middle of last year, did it on his own, but now is back at it and it's worse than its ever been.  I didn't know it was this bad until i got the message from my ex last night.\n\nSorry for the long text, and thank you for reading.  I'm scared.  I'm worried...its making me depressed.  I hope my aunt's will go over there and check up on him.  He's going to die if he doesn't get help.  He's all i have left.\n\n\n *Edit-Neither one of his sisters will help/check on him...the want nothing to do with him.",

They are mostly all Catholic and break zero stereotypes when it comes to drinking. There will be a LOT of alcohol flowing no doubt and I am gonna be there for the after rehearsal party the night before and the wedding itself which will be at night.

I know if there is ever a time to drink in your life it's at a wedding so me not drinking might be met with high suspicion and well I don't want everyone knowing I am an alcoholic.

   "selftext": "I apologize in advance for the wall of text.  This is my first time putting this into writing, so I may ramble a bit.\n\nI'm 30 years old, and have been drinking, regularly or semi-regularly for 15 years, though my first real experience with alcohol happened when I was 10 at my dad's 30th birthday party.  I had finished a soda, and kept refilling the can with beer and wine coolers from the cooler.\n\n6 years later I'm working at a Boy Scout camp in Germany, walking down to the Village after the duty day was complete, spending my meager pay at the local bar with my friends.  After returning home I had a few more instances of heavy drinking in high school.\n\nThen I went to college.  My first night there I went out with my neighbors from the dorm, found a party and drank the night away.  My first semester I was good about keeping my partying to the weekends.  My second semester I was a full member of a fraternity, and had moved out of the dorms and into the house. I started drinking more frequently, using Trivia Night or Logo Glass Night as an excuse to go to the bar any night of the week.  Even if I didn't go out, I'd stay in and find someone to play beer pong, or some other drinking game with.  I stopped going to classes, and withdrew from all my classes halfway through the semester.  That summer I joined the Army, but had to wait a year to ship out.  I enrolled in classes for the fall semester, but fell into my old habits and started drinking and partying heavily, and stopped going to class.  I didn't even bother registering for classes during the spring semester of that year, and just hung out at the fraternity house or the campus bars drinking away student loan money, and donating plasma so I could drink some more.  I should have recognized then that my relationship with alcohol was destructive, but I had a million and one other reasons for my failure.\n\nShipped off to Basic Training that summer.  Had a wonderful (no, really!) experience there.  Had family day on my 21st birthday, but wasn't allowed to drink.  A few weeks later, during AIT (military occupation training) we \"phased\" up and were allowed off post during the day on weekends.  Every Friday and Saturday night were spent off post consuming copious amounts of beer and liquor. In spite of that I was able to graduate that training with honors.\n\nAfter graduation, I go back home (I chose reserve component so I could continue going to school).  I re-enroll in the same college for the fall semester.  This should have been my Junior year, but I didn't even have enough credits to be counted as a Sophomore.  You'd think with my recent return from an environment with rigid discipline I'd be focused and determined to get back on track.  And I was. For a while. But then I let my drinking get the better of me again, and having fun became more important than achieving my goals.  I finally gave up any pretense of going to school the following semester and returned home to live with my parents.  I drank as much and as often as I could afford with my lack of expenses and small monthly check from drilling with the Army.\n\nThe following year, I deployed.  No alcohol for almost a year, barring my R&amp;R halfway through, and I didn't mind it.  I was doing my job, and feeling more alive than I ever had.  I returned home at the end of my deployment, having bought a fast car and having several thousand dollars in the bank.  I started going out with friends regularly, drinking insane amounts, and with my new found sense of immortality often getting behind the wheel at the end of the night.  \n\nThis came to a head one night when high-speed, way to much to drink, and a batch of black ice caused me to careen into a brick wall.  Whats worse, my best friend was in the passenger seat as I was taking him back to his car. I managed to avoid any injury more serious than some superficial cuts and some bruising of my shoulder and kidney from the seatbelt.  My friend suffered more severe injuries when his head struck the brick wall.  Luckily he was able to make a full recovery over the next few weeks. I stopped drinking for over a year during all the legal proceedings and until my license suspension was up.\n\nOnce I started drinking again, I did pretty well at managing it.  I only drank occasionally, and often as little as a single beer with my meal.  Rarely did I drink enough to get drunk. I was introduced to my two year old son from a previous relationship and was really starting to bond with him. I met the woman that would become my wife that summer.  Things were going great!\n\nThen my mom died, suddenly and unexpectedly.  I turned to alcohol to feel numb and get through the following weeks. I lost my job several months later, and found a new one in commission based sales almost immediately.  Almost every night, on my way home, I'd stop and buy a case of beer which would be gone by the next morning.  I'd go to work hung over most days, and sometimes we'd drink on the job.  That company went out of business shortly after, and I had to find yet another job.  I stayed in the same field, though, and eventually wound up as a store manager.  That job stressed me to no end, on top of realizing that I was carrying around some scars from my deployment.  Instead of buying beer on my way home, I was buying a bottle of whiskey on my way in and mixing it with fountain soda all day long.  I was spiraling out of control, and drunkenly quit that job one day just a few hours into my shift.\n\nI got a new job in yet another field.  This one gave me three days off during the week, which I more often than not, spent pounding beers.  Twice I passed out and was woken up by a call from my son's school because I was late to pick him up.  One of those times I also missed a parent/child event that I told him I was going to attend.\n\nI would often get into angry arguments with my wife while drunk.  Vehemently denying that I had had anything to drink.  I would have buried the bottles in the bottom of the outside trashcan before she got home.  Just as I had done a week ago today.  She caught me in the lie.  The very next day I got home and cracked a beer, planning on just having one or two to unwind after work.  I don't remember the rest of the evening. I woke up in the morning and as I was getting out of bed to take the dog out my wife mumbled that she was still mad at me.  At this point, I was scared shitless that I had done something irredeemable.\n\nI hadn't.  When she woke up a while later, we talked.  I told her, \"I'm sorry you married an alcoholic\", and we made a plan. I didn't drink at all that day, in spite of being at a joint party for my father and son.  I haven't drank since. We are going together to an open AA meeting tonight.",

We have known for some time that he had a drinking problem but he had it under \"control\".  Over the past 8\\-10 months, things have escalated significantly.  In January, we brought our young son over to his family's home for a playdate in the late morning.   He was intoxicated when we arrived and claimed to have been grocery shopping; he shot a gun that we didn't know he even had right next to my husband's ear, blowing the ear drum; he then attempted to go sledding with the kids and hurt himself pretty badly \\- cut face, bruising; then, he passed out at the kitchen table at 2 PM.    We had made an offer to his wife to bring her somewhere the following day, to which she responded \"I can't trust him here with the kids alone\".  That was our first real sign that his drinking had escalated. \n\nFast forward to March.  He is involved in a single\\-vehicle accident in the middle of the afternoon with his young child in the car.  No one was phyisically injured, but obviously this is not a small problem.  \n\nSince the accident, while a participant in Intensive Out Patient care for his alcoholism, there have been 6 major incidents involving his drinking, leading to arrest for violation of his conditions of release or hospitalization.\n\nHis wife decided that she needed a break and told him that she was leaving on a vacation with their small children.  They were leaving today.\n\nLast night, BIL went back to the bottle and called some friends out of state.  Those friends were so concerned by his behavior that they called the police to do a wellness check.  The  police arrived and found BIL passed out drunk outside, so they booked him again for violation. \n\n**However**  \\- they also found a noose that he had made lying next to him.  He has been asking over and over again today for his gun \\(which we took after the car accident because of his erratic behavior\\) back. \n\nWe are scared that he is going to harm himself or someone else.  He is refusing any treatment.\n\nWhat options do we have to help him so that he doesn't end up hurting or killing himself?  Can we get him involuntarily committed?  Is the noose sufficient evidence of threatening self harm? \n\nPlease help.  We honestly do not know what to do.  ",

   "selftext": "I'm 35, I've been dealing with depression since I was roughly 12. It took years for me to admit there was anything wrong with me. In my late twenties, after my wife left me, I finally admitted it and went for help. I saw a counselor who was less than impressive. I went to 3 appointments and laid out all the self loathing that was bottles up inside me. Expressed the growing concerns I had about the fact that it was only getting worse and that it was drastically affecting my ability to enjoy life. After the third appointment of this guy basically just responding with \"yup\" and \"uh huh\" I stopped going. I never got a call in regards to missed appointments. \n\nI went to my family doctor and we tried a few medications. I asked her for a reference to a good psychologist. She however said they don't do that and that she suggested I seek one out on my own. After the failure with the first one I never did. I was eventually prescribed Wellbutrin. I started on the low dose 150mg and systematically bumped it up to the 450. It worked well for a while and I was feeling better. \n\nFast forward a couple of years and I had started taking it off and on, it wasn't ever meant to be a final solution. I recently ended a relationship that had lasted over a year. I was taking the meds when we met and stopped during the relationship as I was happy and the depression seemed to have subsided.\n\nNear the end of the relationship I realized just how manipulative and controlling she had been. About 8 months ago I left. I packed what I could and moved out. This was after she had caused me to lose my job. Now I live with a friend who has been very supportive. I still haven't found work though I am learning coding and have a lead once I finish my course. Before that could happen my car was repossessed. This sent my depression spiraling out of control. I am lost. I have a hard time with getting myself to do much of anything now. \n\nI just started taking my meds again and hopefully they will help again. The problem is I am terrified that they won't. I have not been this bad since my divorce. I took to drinking back then before I ever started medication. Luckily I don't have the ability to do that again though I crave the escape from reality it gave me. I had drug problems as a teenager/young adult and don't want to end up in that situation again. \n\nI'm not suicidal but I honestly don't care if I live or die. I feel like a burden to everyone. My fee friends and my family are as supportive as they can be but it's not enough. I have no insurance, no money, no car, live on the good graces of my friends and I live in fear that I am finally going to lose the battle. \n\nIt seems that my depression has evolved to keep up with me and it is stronger now than it's ever been. I don't know what to do if my meds don't help. I don't know where I'll go of my friends get tired of my shit and kick me out. I've lost everything that I built because of a shitty relationship. I have to start over from scratch and I just don't know if I can. I want this roller coaster to stop, I want off the ride.

   "selftext": "I've been thinking about how lucky I am to have had my big wake-up call at this point in life. I am 30 and didn't start drinking until I was 18. I've lost 12 years to alcohol, although it became especially bad in recent years. I have had a serious, scary wake-up call, the full ramifications of which I am still waiting to learn about. However, I am grateful that 1.) I did not hurt myself or others or damage any property. 2.) I have supportive and loving parents, spouse, and sibling that I can be honest with. 3.) I have the financial tools that will allow me to face this, and while it will hurt I won't be financially crippled. If I quit now and stay committed to quitting I can continue to have these things. \n\nMore importantly, I am glad to have my life back. The idea of not drinking again is really liberating and knowing I won't lose another decade to drinking is a relief. I have a lot of people in my family that have struggled with alcohol and many still refuse to give it up despite numerous issues it has caused in their lives. My dad and one of my grandfathers quit in their 40s and 50s respectively and I am so proud of them for that, but I am also so relieved that I don't have another decade or two or three to lose to drinking. I knew my dad when he was an active alcoholic and he became such a better person and father when he stopped. Hopefully, my future kids never have to know drunk me and will only ever have a sober mom in their lives. \n\nI know it is a one-day-at-a-time process and I don't want to get too far ahead of myself or get too high on the \"pink cloud\".

   "selftext": "I don't know whether to laugh or cry. I have anxiety and I struggle with depression and substance abuse. \n\nWhen I'm not high, I'm constantly hating on myself. Constantly running calculations in my head. My brain just runs faster than usual. I cry, I try to watch porn to distract myself. But then I get high and everything goes away. It feels like relief, beauty, calm and a complete understanding of the world is just a step away. So I get high. \n\nMy life perpetually fluctuates between the two and I'm not ashamed of myself or depressed about it. It's just that I broke up with someone I wanted to be with but I was hesitant because of anxiety and depression. And now I'm using marijuana as a coping mechanism. Trust me, I do work out. I do have a routine. I'm active but I'm very alone except my books. \n\nI'm afraid of anything new. I'm the sort of person who is comfortable losing ground slowly everyday. I get up and I fall down and I have been doing that for a long time. I guess that is what rest of the humans do as well. It's just that my intensity is so so loud and sonorous. Everyday I face trouble falling asleep and as if that was not enough, I get up with a sort of panic attack. I really want to kill myself over not saying \"Thank you\" to my barista.\n\nI'm from India and I was dating someone really nice and I couldn't really take the right decision. Ironically, I just wanted to have sex with someone white and I'm afraid of being caught soliciting these things. So for three years, I kept trying and then I told her one day that that is the only reason I am in America and she was hurt but she laughed at the same time too. \n\nAnd now she is dating someone else. Which is okay, good for her. But I'm alone and I looked up the entire arranged marriage tradition. Someone asked me on a date but as a filter they asked me my educational background and my family background. I noped the fuck out of it. \n\nSo here I stand. I have no interest in things which the world has to offer to me. I honestly have a lot of passion in me for music, for books, for poetry, for meditation. I'm genuinely dedicated to figuring this shit out and I'm honestly ahead of a lot of people, thanks, in part, to therapy.\n\nBut I have no real human connections. And I feel like it's either weed or things like a genuine human connection. I mean, where have I come, with all the Philosophy and Psychology and self-improvement. Yes, I meditated a lot. Yes, I improved myself. I still have issues, that is true. But I understand myself well enough to say that it's funny and depressing at the same time. \n\nLife makes no sense. Success, money, status make no sense. They have no correlation, at least for me, to happiness. I don't even mind being sad to be honest. But it looks like this is it. The only thing that I feel like adds some meaning to my life is love really. Sure my job can add meaning, gym can add meaning, writers like Virgina Woolf can add meaning and I'll keep them all with me. But essentially, I'm happiest when I'm in love. \n\nBut what really is love given my condition? Arranged marriage or Tinder. So let's talk about an arranged marriage. I have to tell my family background to the family of the girl before I get to see her. And I live in Seattle. It should be safe for me to not disclose these details and still be a nice person. \n\nBecause my family is composed of simple village-dwelling people. My parents are the sweetest people in the world but they are not successful, they don't have any accolades to show off. They still say that me and my brother are their biggest achievements, I mean the kind of people we have grown up as. They won't qualify any screening test and so won't I. \n\nNow let's talk about tinder or neo-dating. I'm brown, I'm fit but I'm not athletic. I'm decent looking but I'm no rockstar. I write nice messages to everyone on OkCupid. I do feel frustrated at times but I still am not rude to anybody for their choice of not liking me. I get it. But where does that put me? Three years. Not a single good friend. And it's getting worse. I have lost my energy to want to impress people. And neither do I expect this from someone. I know I'm not a 10. I usually don't message anybody out of my league. The only people I don't message are people who I am not attracted to at all. And I guess the people who reject me are coming from a similar position. But it essentially creates Capitalism out of dating. \n\nI don't want sex. I don't want anything hot. Or a person who hikes. I just someone who likes me. And I would genuinely try to make it work. I won't reject someone because they don't have a wanderlust or if they are a recovering alcoholic. Do other people see dating in this way? In my experience, a lot of us don't.\n\nI meditated. I wrote my journals. I read amazing books. I watched amazing shows and movies. I learnt to make music. I learnt to appreciate all kinds of music. I became well versed in Philosophy. I am on my journey to become fairly well versed in Psychology. I got healthy and I ran for miles. People say that I'm intelligent and creative. \n\nBut at the same time, I got a pornhub premium subscription. I have smoked weed almost everyday for the past two years. My career makes no sense. I developed a bit of an eating disorder. I broke up with my best friend and my girlfriend. I want to go back to India but where exactly? That's a shitty feeling you know. The home no longer exists. When people tell me that I'm intelligent and creative, I think they are just saying it. They don't mean it. I see that the problem here is with self-esteem. I see all my problems very clearly. I still can't fix them. My hands go automatically to weed, then to my penis and then to pornhub. I constantly lie to myself and also to others. \n\nThat's the depressing part about it all. It's a wall and I really really really wanna climb that wall, it will give me a lot of meaning. But I don't know how. I know everything about the wall, the color, the dimension, the material. But it seems like I don't have hands. I can't fucking climb the wall. So I take the door. But I'm too big for the door. I can't fit in. I have too much of a baggage to carry. So I turn back to my safe place. My home. But that's not there either. Confused, I run from this corner to that corner and then I see weed. I smoke weed and the desolate desert of my existence turns into a plush booming oasis. But it soon goes away, the cold breeze of the oasis soon turns warm. And I find myself staring at the door again.\n\n\nSo do I cry or do I laugh. I'm doing both at the moment. In my opinion, there's a very thin line between emotions. I also know that very few people will read this gigantic wall of text. It's all good. No new information has been added to the system. ",

I go to a college where the binge drinking culture is very bad and a solid chunk of my friends are alcoholics, but don\u2019t admit it. But I have to admit I\u2019m an alcoholic. I\u2019m a 21 year old girl and I just don\u2019t want to let alcohol control my life even more than it does. I go out 4 times a week, I\u2019ve drank\u2014 even in the day\u2014to get the courage to talk to people. I\u2019ve drank alone. I can only have \u201c1 drink\u201d in public but I secretly wish I could have more. I know it\u2019s inhibiting the best person I can be but every time I try to stop I get dragged back in. It also sucks because I struggle with depression and my meds make me feel numb and emotionless and I try to combat that with alcohol a lot, which is bad. How do you guys deal with cravings and does it get better? Do you guys have any certain phrases you say to your mind to help (for ex: \u201cthis craving will pass in a minute, don\u2019t give in). are there any other college students on this subreddit? If so, how did you maintain sobriety in a drinking culture environment? I\u2019m just so lost and this is the first time I\u2019ve posted on reddit. I see how great this community is and I could really use your kind words. ",

My mom is a high functioning alcoholic and has been trying to recover for maybe around 10 months now, though she's relapsed in-between. My problem is even though she's her normal self now (which still is pretty hard to deal with) I can't stop thinking of her as the person I hated for years. I didn't even realize that she was an abnormal parent until around 13 and as soon as I did I saw all my memories from when I was younger differently. I mean I knew we didn't get along at all but I guess I thought it was just normal for teens and parents to fight. Either way, I'm finding it very hard to not think of her as the drunk she was for as long as I can remember. Any advice on getting past it or if it's even possible to change how I see her? Can I get rid of the resentment I feel?",

I don't have a dependency or daily need. I call myself a social drinker(and smoker), problem is, im VERY social. My job is in entertainment and involves late nights quite often in the music scene.\n\nMy problem is, when I have one drink, I tend to have many, many more. It's like im running away from something. Last call? Sure one more! (dumb idea before driving). Then that often leads to bad decisions (pablo) and even later nights (and a pack of smokes).\nLast week I caught myself waking up having abnormal sensations in my chest, a slight pain in my lower abdomen, and a hypersensitive groin area. I freaked myself out and had to go to the doctor after my heart pounded for two nights of no sleep, blood pressure skyrocketed. After looking into various medical conditions on youtube, i freaked myself out even more (thought i had cancer or heart attack/disease)\n\nAnyway, i went to the doctor and i was fine. Apparently my diet had a lot to do with it, but it was a wake up call.\n\nThat being said, its easy to say IM DONE right now. But, were only human, time passes. I don't wanna do it anymore. Any of it.\nSo, thats why im here. I am curious to hear your thoughts, and i think support is what im missing, because my friend circle clearly isn't stopping soon.\n\nAnyway, thanks in advance for any advice, comments, or whatever.

   "selftext": "Hello, My name is Terry, and I'm an alcoholic.\n\nIve had numerous attempts at sobriety, with months of success, and after a few months I always tell myself I can drink responsibly, and inevitably end up in the same dark place after a month or two long bender. \n\nThis time feels different as I truly feel I hit rock bottom in a weird way. Multiple hospital visits, and basically being told I would die if I continued always bought me a few months or weeks of sobriety and should have been the end of my drinking. I always simply tried not to drink, but the problem of being an alcoholic is much deeper than that, you have to actively try to DO something, instead of just trying NOT to. \n\nA very dear friend, mentor, band member and one of the greatest people I've ever met passed away in November at the age of 43, (I'm 30) He had previously sold me one of his guitars for half what it was worth because he had quite a collection and said he couldn't think of anyone who'd he'd rather have it. It became one of the most important possessions in my life, and even more so after he passed. I struggled to run my own business and dealt with his passing and other bad things in my life by drowning them. My money well had soon run dry and was coming up with empty buckets and a reminder of large debt.\n\nOne day I went to the pawn shop and pawned the guitar, with every intention of getting it back, and quickly, mind you. I knew that i could make a good chunk of money each day and get it back no problem. True, if I wasn't an alcoholic. Each day the money earned would get whittled down, buying booze, gambling and basically pissing it away.  I could never save up the full amount to go and grab the pawn. \n\nTwo months passed of some of the most intense hell on earth I've ever experienced, seriously comtemplating suicide, feeling hopeless that my life would never turn around, and feeling haunted that i had made such a stupid decision in the first place and how disappointed he would have been in me. My mind was out of control, like someone was holding a remote and flipping the channels in my brain through some of the weirdest and darkest thoughts I've ever had, barely slept, barely ate, just drank to run away to get those moments of quiet inevitably followed by worse hell the next day. rinse and repeat.\n\nTwo days before the pawn would have been sold I borrowed some money off his fiance to get the guitar back saying I had pawned one of my others because i knew she would be so hurt by me even risking losing it even though I had no intention of doing so. \n\nThis was my rock bottom, not the intense pain when my pancreas almost exploded, not alcoholic hepatitis and jaundice, but the realization that I was a piece of shit when I drank. Not at all who I should be, and there was a good person in there under all that shit, and in all of you who want to put down that bottle. How could I betray such a good man, by risking something so important to both of us, just to get drunk for another couple weeks and run away from it all. Shit is EVIL.\n\nIt's a long road and the only way to take it is one day at a time, but in this latest sober plunge my life has improved so much in such a short time, by simply trying to be honest with myself and others, trying to look forward and not in the rearview mirror, trying to remind myself that I am choosing not to drink because everything else gets better and just trying to be a good person. Just trying! of course nobody's perfect but it feels great to try to be simply GOOD!, and not the shitbag that is only focused on him or herself and their next drink. \n\nA friend of mine that I met through AA said it best when he told me \"you have a simple choice to make, you can drink, or you can have everything else in your life\". Someone told him that 17 years ago, and he said it was the hardest decision he has ever made in his life. Isn't that crazy? \n\nI know for me it was and is a way harder decision than it should have to be. This is how evil this shit is and how much it can control and spiral our lives out of control. He also struck a chord when i spoke out of turn at my first meeting. He had been speaking directly to me so I replied, and I'm glad I did. He shouted \"You don't know shit, the first lesson is silence, just listen. Take the cotton batten out of your ears and put it in your mouth, these guys around you have lived it and they know alot about getting sober and staying sober, and you need to just listen\" The next meeting I thanked him as honest and earnest as i had thanked anyone in my life, for putting me in my place and that it had rung such a bell within me, he was exactly right. I truly did not know shit about staying sober, maybe for a few months, but as far as long term no way. That was why I had fallen so far and why I was at the meetings. I vowed to listen and learn.\n\nI'm going to get a tattoo this time so that if I crave a drink I can look at it and say no, never again will i walk to the edge and look down. I definitely don't know everything but I do know that I resisted meetings for so long because I didn't want to sit in a circle and talk about my feelings and introduce myself as an alcoholic, and of course the whole God thing really scared me away. \n\nI had always been spiritual and believed in a higher power and a type of force or karma, or just generally forces of good and evil in the world. I definitely wasn't and am not a fan of organized religion. If you are or aren't whatever works for you is fine. The basis of AA is giving yourself to a higher power, and allowing yourself to admit that your not the center of the universe and this self-centered and self worshipping has gotten you into the shitstorm that is  the hell of being a full on alcoholic.\n\nIf you are ready to quit drinking or want to stay sober, this coming from a person who shunned and avoided anything to do with AA for years. It helps, it really fucking helps. I go to 2 meetings a week and the ability to talk openly about terrible shit you have done or things that are weighing on your mind with people who have most likely done equally bad or worse things, and have felt the hell that is addiction, is priceless. Just having those checkpoints and being proud to show up at the meeting knowing that you haven't drank since the last one, and the one before that is amazing.\n\nI'm sure the shock of it helping will wear off but if you are thinking about getting help and know you need it, just give it a try, it definitely won't hurt, if its not for you it's not for you, but I avoided it for years and I regret it.\n\nI apologize for the rambling and a bit unorganized flow of thoughts but I have still got a long way for my brain to adjust to being sober and I just want to stress that if you have ever thought about going for meetings or need help and don`t know how to stop, please give it a shot, it was extremely difficult to walk through that door but it was one of the best decisions Ive made in my life and I do not ever want to hit day 1 again. \n\nNo one deserves to go through the hell we put ourselves through with the drink and I do not want anyone to come as close to taking the way out I almost chose. It is night and day how much better I feel since my last drink and of course there will be bad times in my life in the future and never will everything with roses. I am in a fair amount of debt, but I am learning to do what I can, and accept what I can`t and fuck all the rest. I hope to deal with my problems properly instead of drowning them, they always surface, uglier and bloated from the stink of the drink. You are not alone.\n\nAll the best in your sober quest!  Meditate, don`t Medicate.",

In particular, all examples I see tend to involve significantly longer binging/higher consumption than mine, which makes it hard to assess. \n\nHere's my situation: 28yo, 130lbs, 10+ drinks on Friday &amp; Saturday nights type, have been for 10 years, no withdrawal issues ever (even on slightly longer binges), thought blacking out pretty much completely is very common, which is anecdotally not normal apparently. \n\nRecently had a bad 2-week binge after a breakup, at well over 10+ drinks per day for 14 days in a row, and I had withdrawal symptoms for the first time (seemingly in the moderate area from what I've read: really bad insomnia, hands shaking, night sweats, tons of \"vivid nightmares while half asleep\" bordering on hallucination, very foggy/\"permadrunk\" feeling during the day, irregular heartbeat), but took a few weeks off drinking and got back to normal. Actually saw a doctor because I started googling these symptoms and got scared of DTs, but he sent me home untreated saying things like \"the guys I get here I'm actually worried about are shaking 10x more violently than you are\". He also said \"but by my diagnosis, you definitely are an alcoholic\", which is kind of rattling.\n\nLast weekend, after the few weeks off to feel back to normal, did a typical 10+ drinks on Friday/Saturday, expecting Sunday to be totally normal, but I'm seemingly having withdrawal symptoms again starting Sunday and still going on now (full nights of insomnia in particular, a touch of the vivid nightmares/hallucination and irregular heartbeat type of stuff). Just for more perspective, I've been a fall-asleep-in-10-seconds person my entire life, so insomnia is extremely odd for me, especially this severe. \n\nSo, is this an example of kindling? I don't know how bad this kind of situation is: is total abstinence at this point a knee-jerk overreaction, or is continuing to use my body to test this out actually dangerous? If the answer is \"not likely kindling, but cut back on 10+ drinks and blacking out\" that's great. \n\nLike I said, I'm also open to the possibility I'm saying a lot of dumb things, so just looking for any info or related situation you can help me with..",

That means me and my mom. So at the beginning of the school year, I was moved into homeschool, an online school program, so I would get used to it while in Europe. (was starting high school and I didn't see the point in  staying there for a year since it's a terrible school) My dad travels to Europe about once every month for two weeks, been that way since September. Sometimes he goes for longer. \n\nMy mother, a housewife, never completed high school and never kept up with schooling so she could never help me with my online school. The program I'm in is basically like \"here's 6 weeks worth of school work. Complete it in 6 months\", the school gave no dates except my expiration date. So with my dad gone, brother in college and mom not participating in my schooling, I stopped doing it in November. I finished two courses and that's it. I played video games and watched movies for about 6 months. \n\nI know. Terrible choices. \n\nEventually, the expiration date came. I finally fessed up to my dad. He was mad but then understood it was cuz he was always gone and never paid attention to my schooling. So we got an extension, he said he'd do a better job of monitoring me but then he just said 'finish your courses' and left for 2 weeks.\n\nI'm struggling to stay motivated and do my work but I can't with my mother. She's a short tempered, impatient, narcissistic, alcoholic asshole to put it simply. I actually think She's bipolar. She makes snide comments about me during the day but it gets really bad when she gets drunk. (she drinks at least 2-3 drinks every night, One night she drank four bottles of wine, it's about 4 bottles and some beet every week that she finishes by herself). When people come around, she puts on this 'perfect' face and pleases them. Then she talks about them behind her back. She constantly tells me off for telling people her location when they ask where she is and she constantly wants me to lie for her. I can't do that. \n\nSo I'm stuck with my mother and my brother is no help. He goes to college and sometimes comes home on the weekend. He s under 21 but still drinks (my parents allow him) and so he drinks with my mother. Whenever my dad comes home, he drinks with her. My brother also wants me to do all his chores. The bathroom is dirty? I'm the maid. I ask him to do the dishes once? He tells me I have no right to ask him to do them because he goes to college and I'm homeschooled. I ask him to walk our dog (when we adopted our dog from our deceased grandmother, we made an agreement to each pull our own weight for the dog because our parents don't want anything to do with it) once, he always says he's tired from college (even on the weekends). And I get it, he has a lot on his plate but these aren't everyday favors. I only ask him once or twice every two weeks.\n\nHe has also started to belittle me. Today, I was cleaning our dog's food bowl and my mom got mad at me for washing it in the sink. I was using soap and bleach, I planned on washing the sink afterwards and they blew up. They were like 'you idiot, contamination is contamination'. My brother, under his breath said 'she doesn't know anything because she's... (he was about to say homeschooled but then he paused and after a while he said) doesn't take a home ec class.' I did take a home ec class in middle school. They warned us about salmonella for contamination. Not dog food bowls.\n\nMy mom isn't that educated and they don't do this to her. \n\nI've been through this a lot, I have thick skin. When this happens, I detach because I'm not emotional prepared to go back in and act all cheery after comments like that. I just remain emotionless cuz my mom gets mad when I act out. So I dont. Then, the entire evening, they're like 'why you so grumpy? must be on her period or something'. I don't respond because this is them baiting me. \n\nIf I confronted my brother with this, he would just brush it off like 'I'm just messing with you, calm down,'. I hate it cuz this fucking hurts and I don't say this to him. I don't say anything about his weight gain or what he eats. I don't do anything to him. \n\nI'm really done with this. \n\nI'm not suicidal, I don't want to die. I have cut myself in the past but it didn't do anything for me. They've seen my scars and just ignore it. I'm glad they see it. They did that to me and I healed myself without them so. \n\nI really want to run away. I can't talk to my family about this. My mom's side is in a different country. My grandparents are alcoholics and insane. My dad's side  lives four hours away and they've seen my parents behavior and haven't commented on it. We only see them like twice a year so there really is no reason why they'd care. \n\nPretty much all of my friends stopped talking to me when I became homeschooled. I don't have parental figures near me whom I could talk to. \n\nI feel suffocated here. I can't stand it. And we're moving to Europe within the next few months so I'll be truly alone with my parents. I don't think I'll last. I can't be homeschooled anymore. I can't be around them anymore. \n\nI really do feel like running away. I know the consequences, especially since I don't have a high school degree. I don't know what to do. I'd rather be starving in the streets than continue being suppressed.\n\nTL;DR: Narcissistic mother, alcoholic parents, dad who's never home. Became homeschooled and grades became non existent. Family is moving to Europe and I don't want to go. Am contemplating running away.",

   "selftext": "I happened to come across an interview in *The Atlantic* with Leslie Jamison, a writer, chronic overachiever, and recovering alcoholic, tonight.  The excerpt below encapsulated my life so perfectly that it took my breath away.  I imagine there are other SD members who will feel the same way, so I thought it was worth sharing:\n\n\"...there\u2019s something inside of me that just had this kind of determined drive toward a kind of excess. I didn\u2019t just want to be good. I wanted to be the best. In that way, the drive toward excess in terms of achievement feels related to the drive toward excess in terms of booze or getting drunk. I didn\u2019t want to feel just a little bit of a good feeling. I wanted to feel the strongest version of it.\"\n\nMy post title is my short-hand for the temperament or obsession that Jamison is describing...I have always been compelled to overachieve, overthink, overexert myself, overdo, overanalyze...to just go overboard with everything.  I never just feel bad about something; I feel like the worst human being alive.  I'm never content with just meeting the requirements; I have to overperform expectations.  Sometimes my own demands on myself are so exhausting and so inescapable that I can't think of any way to ease the strain other than through alcohol, and then \"just enough to take the edge off\" isn't nearly enough.  \n\nI doubt that I can ever learn to just *moderate* my drinking, but I think that in order to maintain sobriety, I must learn to moderate my other compulsions.  If I cannot, I will always feel the need for alcohol to dull the relentless prodding of my own dissatisfaction with myself. \n\nUnfortunately, I'm not sure that recognizing this problem will help me resolve it.  Hopefully when I see my therapist next week, she can help me find a way to make use of these insights.\n\nHere's a link to the interview in *The Atlantic* for anyone who is interested in reading the rest:\n\n[The Experiment in Irresponsibility]\n(https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/i-started-to-drink-on-the-job/559265/)",

   "selftext": "I'm a 29 year old loser who lives in my parents basement. I can't drive because of my anxiety and I cant hold down a job because of my multiple mental illnesses and general lack of discipline. \n\nI like art and music but I have zero talent and I suck at pretty much everything I try to do. I'm on medication for my obsessive compulsive disorder and clinical depression. I have a hard time relating to human beings and just being around them stresses me out. So I isolate myself and become nocturnal to have as little human contact as possible. My whole life a and personality seems like a genetic defect. I feel like a crushed insect. A failure and degenerate abomination of evolution. A worthless peasant at the bottom of the food chain.\n\nI have a huge inferiority complex. I'm always thinking about how im not tall enough or handsome enough. I've become a self-destructive alcoholic and chain smoker. I smoke and drink until I feel sick and then I smoke and drink some more. I can feel myself gravitating towards harder drugs because I don't care about myself or my health. \n\nSometimes I drink until I black out and I've ended up doing some abhorrent things when I black out that bring me massive amounts of guilt and regret. I feel like a burden on my parents and the few friends I have.  \n\nI'm addicted to vodka as it is one of the only things that makes me feel artificial joy for a few hours but then the aftermath always throws me into a pit of despair and I am more despondent then ever. So I drink more to deal with the pain. It's a vicious cycle I cant seem to escape because I'm not mentally or emotionally strong enough. \n\nI'm on automatic self-destruction mode and I cant seem to press the stop button on the soulless machine. I can feel myself decaying and my health going down the drain but I don't care because I am just a worthless prison of flesh and bone. I have no future. My only future is death.\n\nI am an atheist and a nihilist because my life experiences and logic have brought me to feel those things are truth. I hate being an atheist and a nihilist. I wish there was a God and a heaven. I wish there was a meaning and purpose to my cursed existence but there isn't and I know there isn't. The highest power that exists is the law of nature and nature is a cold and cruel fascist who is indifferent to all pain and suffering. It does not cry when a predator kills and devours the flesh of its victim prey. Nature doesn't care about people decaying from diseases. I'm full of bitter poison and I've never hated any of my enemies as much as I hate myself. \n\nThe only reason I'm still here is because the idea of eternal nothingness scares the hell out of me. I'd kill myself in a second if I thought it would take me to a better place but I know it wouldn't.\n So I guess even this life of agony and torment is better than total nothingness because maybe once in a blue moon I can feel alive and a little spark of joy.\n\nI don't know though the day may come where I just become so exhausted from this pointless struggle and suffering that I just welcome death and fall into the abyss. I feel that day getting closer and closer. So basically I'm too much of a coward to commit suicide. The only reason I still exist is fear. \n\nWell if you have read and suffered through my whole rant. Thank you from the bottom of my black heart . ",

   "selftext": "I had been sober for 3 months. I started drinking two days before the vacation. The first day I had two beers and felt 'meh' about it. Still convinced I wouldn't drink on vacation. But then the day before I drank again. And on the vacation itself I just picked up drinking like I had never stopped. \n\nThere were nights of drama and nights of fun, sure, but what I failed to remind myself of then was that alcohol wasn't needed to have fun. I did it anyway. I wanted to, everyone was doing it, I was letting loose. \n\nFast forward to when I'm back home, feeling depressed about being back and having to get back to the grind and convined I can moderate, I continue drinking. It sort of works. \n\nI go home earlier from the bar, I say no to a couple of drinks, and stop when I've had enough. 'Enough' being that I feel unwell and my heart is racing uncomfortably. Overal though, I am convinced that I have finally become an adult that can drink in moderation. \n\nBut by now a tiny voice in my head has popped up, 'No, no you cant, because you can't get up in the mornings, and saying no is getting harder, and thoughts of drinking are consuming you'. \n\nTwo days ago I went out drinking when just that morning I was still feeling sick from drinking the night before. It all seemed fine. We had fun, friends and colleagues eventually joined in. But then, and I see this now in hindsight, I started thinking more about the next drink than the conversation. More about doing shots and staying drunk than having fun. \n\nThat isn't 'enjoying life', that's being an alcoholic. The next day we all wake up smiling and brushing off the events of last night. We try desperately to convince ourselves that 'it was so much fun' and 'such a good time'. I throw up. \n\nI spend the day in a low energy stupor trying to hydrate and make myself forget. This morning I was still feeling shitty so I messaged my boss to say I was sick (for the second time since I've been back from vacation) and he calls me, angry. 'We're back where we started' he says, he can't go down this road with me again. If I do, he will start building a case and fire me, or I have to leave willingly, but he's not doing it again. \n\nI took the call in the bathroom because I don't want my SO to hear. I don't want to tell him because I'm embarrassed and ashamed. I feel horrible. I'm still in the bathroom now, trying not to cry as I type this. I know better. I AM better than this. So why did I let it get this far again? Fuck. \n\nI'm taking a deep breath, and making today day one. I will not drink with you today.",

I can't do this and it's just a matter of time when I *need* to drink. I'll just reset the counter on Saturday and start anew.\n\nI finish my work and drive home with my 6-pack (it's not enough for me usually but since I planned to continue drinking till Saturday I didn't want to be too hungover). \n\nWhile driving home I sense that something is wrong and that is my body and mind telling me what I'm doing is stupid. Just the thought of drinking made me feel sick. \n\nI remembered the inevitable hangover, waking up in the middle of the night feeling horrible, my daily check-in pledge here I made this morning, remembered I'm an alcoholic and that deep down I don't want to drink. So I didn't and went to bed and slept great.\n\nThis morning I woke up with gratitude and clarity: it's just my addiction that wants me to drink and not get better. \n\nWith this newly found insight I will gladly make the decision that just for today, I will not drink alcohol.\n\nThank you for every single post made on SD. It reminds me that we together have a single goal and that is to stop the BULLSHIT and truly live life. I read about 10 posts daily now and it's clearly a big factor in my sobriety.

   "selftext": "Something I have been pondering for a while: where is the line between liking alcohol, and alcoholism? Do I drink because I like alcohol and choose to drink it, or am I addicted and justifying what I do?\n\nI've always liked strong liquor, and never understood why some people think neat liquor is too strong to drink. When it comes to alcoholic beverages, I've always preferred drinks that are over 50% in alcohol content. For me it's always been about the taste and the warm glowing sensation it causes.\n\nI used to drink 2 glasses on the majority of days, at night before going to bed. And I don't mean just gulping down 2 glasses, but sitting back with a book or something on tv, sipping from my glass at the end of a busy day. Never more than 2 glasses.\n\nI've always been careful not to get drunk, simply because I hate being drunk. Sure, it's happened a couple of times in my adult years, such as on newyears eve. Even then, I was legally drunk but still able to talk, walk, and know what I am doing.\n\nSince I've always been aware that logically, there has to be a line where a controlled habit becomes an addiction, and because of that I regularly decided in a pseudo random manner to not drink until the end of whatever month it happened to be, which meant I would not drink anything for a period that could be between 1 to 4 weeks. This was just to prove to myself that I was not having a problem.\n\nIn my inexperienced opinion, maintaining control is what makes the difference. I'm curious to know if that matches what people here think.\n\nBtw, I've quit alcohol altogether for about a month now. Not because I don't like it anymore, but because I have a medical issue for which I need to lose weight, and alcohol is one of the things I scrapped from my day, together with sugary snacks and other junk.\n\nI didn't think quitting would have any effect at all because it was not difficult, but one surprising thing I noticed is that now I dream more often, more clearly. And it takes me less time to go from grumpy to awake.",

But you would never know it. Upscale family, always held down great jobs, nice houses, nice cars, my mom has five kids who all have gone on to do amazing things, and none of them with any sort of substance abuse issues. But we all held that secret about my mom tight behind closed doors. Since 2014 my mom has actually been sober. I don't know how or why and I didn't question it. I just reveled in it, actually having a mom for once!! \n\nSo when I got a call today that she was in the ER after driving drunk, and that the cops found bottles of wine and pills in her vehicle, I was ....furious. She had hit multiple parked vehicles. Thankfully no one was hurt. It sounds heartless to say I don't really care what shape she was in. But my first question to the nurse was \"did she hurt anyone?\" No. But that she was still going to jail and was going to be there until someone bailed her out. The nurse asked if I wanted the information on how to get a hold of her and I said....No. \n\nMy vain arrogant mother is sitting in jail right now. Am I allowed to do that? Am I allowed to be angry or should I be sad? I keep thinking she could have killed someone. I keep thinking I'm so tired of being her keeper. ",

Last Friday I could tell that I was in the middle of what is called a \"flare-up.\" From last Friday until Wednesday, I could not move my left leg or my left hand. I got placed on some handy-dandy steroids and I am getting much better now. But the days in between...I wanted to pop open our liquor cabinet, open one of those bottles of Rum, Gin, Whiskey that are LITERALLY always here, and drink to not feel the pain. My wife and I went out twice this week to get our of the house and deal with the harsh reality that she has never seen about my disease; and to also get the roid frustration out. In both of those nights, it would have been SO easy to order that G&amp;T, get that sweet delicious Margarita from our favorite bartender in the wold, or to order a quick and cheap beer. \n\nI didn't.

   "selftext": "So I struggled even working up the courage to make this post on here because I was worried someone might call wrong place to post or that I haven't been active enough on here. Either way I need to vent and hear some feedback from someone.\n\nI am not sure if this is an overall anxiety issue or only social anxiety. I have dealt with stress about various issues for most of my life and constantly sruggle with lessening self-esteem/confidence. I am married to a wonderful person who worries about me and tells me I need friends but between my inability to approach people and if approached myself my then distrust of other's intentions, I have kind of backed myself into a corner unintentionally.\n\nI have been a SAHM (stay at home mom) since my baby was born almost two years ago and I wouldn't trade it for anything because once again, I don't trust people. It saves us on sitter costs and I know what kind of care my child is getting. But the one thing is that it does make socializing more difficult. At least it does for me.\n\nI am also an atheist so I have no church or religious group to meet up with once a week. This also worries me a little considering where I live the majority of the population are very Christian to the point of where I honestly feel my coming out as not agreeing with them has alienated me from anyone I used to be friends with as well as much of my family. So even though I am raising my child to form their own opinions (they can choose to believe in whatever or not believe whenever they feel ready just want it to be a non-coerced decision) I worry about people judging them based on mine or my husband's religious label and alienating them from playdates and such.\n\nAnd I don't drink due to being the daughter of an abusive alcoholic. So I can't use that as a platform for socializing either. My husband has said that a woman he works with (who I shared several interests with) was interested in hanging out with me until she learned I didn't drink. I am also concerned that my non-drinking has caused my husband to be invited out less by his friends because they often want to double date but its a bit of a downer having a sober person you feel is left out there. I have tried to like alcohol, but I can't stomach the smell or that similar undertone in all of it.\n\nI have always been the quiet type. I'm awkward and every time I have attempted to make a friend on my own I have pushed people to dislike me or call me annoying. Any friendships I have made have been ones where a more outgoing individual approached me first. My husband was one of these and we have been together eight years. So it isn't like I can't maintain relationships entirely, but I wonder sometimes if something is so off about me it makes people grow to not like me as many of my old close friends drifted to ignoring me. I am terrified of strangers and have been since I was little. I have worked customer service since I was fifteen so I learned how to mask it but it is still difficult. I often try to hard to appeal to people and overshare like how I'm rambling now.\n\nI hope that this is cohesive enough. Please anyone with any advice/suggestions is welcome because I am not sure where to go from here.",

   "selftext": "I am an adult woman and I learned about 5 years ago that my dad had an alcohol addiction. He has a lot of anxiety, and every once in a while he has crises where he drinks a lot of alcohol \\(he hides it\\). Sometimes the crises are triggered by social events where he believes he has to drink alcohol to belong with the crowd.\n\nI had witnessed some crises and I usually don't do anything until my dad melts down in front of us \\(usually my mom, my brothers and me\\) and we then have a very long conversation about his addiction and his anxiety.\n\nHe is in the middle of one crises. My brother and his girlfriend were there earlier this week and my dad melted down \\(he had been drinking again for about two weeks\\). We had a very long conversation in which my brother told my dad that he was going to change his role, that he was going to coach my dad as of now. The thing is, my brother lives quite far away. I currently live with my parents again due to an injury. After the big conversation I told my dad that I would quit Coca\\-Cola while he quits alcohol. I made up a chart in which we have to make a cross every day we're not drinking.\n\nWell today my dad said he could make a cross. So I told him he would be able to do that tomorrow, and I decided I would be the coach.\n\nI started by putting tape on the door to the backroom where the alcohol is stored. My mom had thrown out all the hard liquor but my dad started drinking wine. I have a mind to throw out the wine but I'll pitch the idea to my mom first \\(and to my dad when he's out of his crisis\\). I told my dad he wasn't allowed there, and that if he needed something from that room \\(the freezer is there too\\) he had to ask me first.\n\nThen I offered to help organize a big party he's throwing next August for his retirement. It started well, but then we argued about making it a non\\-alcohol party and I kind of regretted being the coach. My dad had really bad arguments for having alcohol at the party, then he started on about how he wasn't the only one with an addiction, that my mom was addicted to chocolate...I was able to cut the conversation short and now he's watching TV and we're going to go to the grocery store in a little bit. He's quite agitated so I told him he needed to keep his mind occupied and I keep offering activities, but it doesn't work all the time.\n\nSo, there goes. I'm my dad's alcohol coach. I've only started literally a couple of hours ago and I already understand why my mom never wanted to coach my dad. She wants him to take care of the problem himself, but she still has lots of conversations and arguments about alcohol with my dad.\n\nBut I'm glad I did something. Watching my dad slowly killing himself with his addiction was becoming unbearable. I still don't know if coaching my dad is my best decision, but I can't go back now! I hope he will be out of his crisis soon and I plan on trying to keep talking about alcohol when he's sober. We still need to convince him about the whole alcohol\\-free party thing.",

   "selftext": "Hey Friends! It\u2019s surreal to think I actually quit drinking 2 years ago. To put things into some perspective... I am a 46 yo male that was a hard drinker for decades. It pretty much consumed every aspect of my life. Everything I did included drinking. I ended up with a liter of vodka a day habit, it was a living nightmare. I was a functional alcoholic. Always rang the bell at work and got the kids to school but poisoned and hungover constantly. I\u2019m not talking normal hangovers, 4 or 5 day hangovers were common and would always have to drink to cover the pain. I hold to that pain (for good or bad) to remind myself why I can\u2019t go back. I was completely controlled by alcohol. Does that sound familiar to anyone reading? \nOne night lying in bed curled in a fetal poison, drunk and alone I googled stop drinking. This is were I found you wonderful people! Before I found this group, I tried quitting countless of times unsuccessful. I started reading all of the amazing stories that we provide each other. Success stories, setbacks/struggles and most importantly I was able find tools to help me cope with my journey to stop drinking. \n\nFast forward 2 years and I really don\u2019t miss it. Having a sober lifestyle is the way to go! I still feel like a newbie at this and I do have to navigate my way through triggers and the ol lizard brain trying to trick me. It is much easier now and words could never express my gratitude and appreciation for this place and you kind sober friends! \nIf you are just starting your journey please know that you are not alone and you CAN do this. There is life after booze!

For hours after, I felt strong, compassionate towards my alcoholic husband, loving and patient with my children and empowered.  I felt renewed, that I did something positive for ME.\nThen I fell asleep on the couch watching tv with my husband at 9:30, only to be awoken at 1AM by my husband coming home from wherever (most likely the bar) he was.  I know I can't control what he does.  And still my anxiety, my fear, my panic sends me into a tailspin.  \nIn the past 3 months, I've only been to 4 meetings.  Yesterday I went on a whim because I was reading thru this sub and was able to leave work early enough to make the meeting and still make it to pick the kids up from school.  It's like it was meant to be.  The universe made it so.  And I'm so very grateful.  \nI love him, and I hate him.  Today, I'm not leaving him.  And it's the living with him, lovingly, that I struggle with.  Knowing he is out every single night feels like such a betrayal.  Obviously, though, any confrontation is turned around to be my fault.  I know that's his disease talking, but here I am anyway.  Living with this man whom I hate one day, love the next.  Who is an attentive, loving man and father, unless he's not.  Sober or not he's angry.  We're both adult children of alcoholics.  We've been in couples counseling for years.  And still I don't know that we're going to make it.  So I'll go to a meeting this weekend.  Hopefully.  Just thinking about trying to get to a meeting is stressing me out.  But I know I need it.  I wish i could go every day.",

   "selftext": "Being in my current memory...\n\nI'm grappling with what I feel is a mid-life, dull thud.  It's the kind of feeling that at first glance seems to lack gratitude, a gross feeling that makes you not want to examine any further.\n\nMy life is beautiful.  I am surrounded by successful, loving people.  My work carries its challenges and stressors as work is supposed to, but the rewards are comfort and security.  Our son is heading into adulthood on good footing and I am in love beyond words with my wife.  I am as mentally fit as I've ever been, combining daily recovery, with a healthy dose of new, meaningful friendships.  So why the \"blah\" feeling?\n\nThis prose is prompted by doing something as silly as completing my landscaping.  I live in a new community where the mighty powers of the HOA put you on a strict timeline to complete your landscaping.  Understanding that the wondrous workings of the smallest of governments are here to make sure we all have the appearance of normalcy and success, I am more than willing to comply.  But that's just it, when I was putting in my yard at my first home in my twenties, I was enthusiastic.  I was consumed with the artistic vision of learning and creating something new!  Now I'm, ...ehh.\n\nI can spotlight a ton of those moments in my twenties; My first concert at Red Rocks, a career field that carried otherworldly clout, my first home, the birth of my son... I have memories of how excited I was to be participating in these epic \"life moments\" for the first time.  I was hitting all the benchmarks of what it meant to achieve in a good life.   I will admit, those things came early and easy for me.  I often wonder if my alcoholism developed strictly out of boredom.  Things were too easy and I had to dumb myself down and put myself into finicky health and legal situations just to get the spark of a challenge. The juxtaposition of the upright, middle American citizen, adding the ugliest of taboo consequences of addiction. \n\nSo here I am, kind of feeling like I'm on the verge of sober Jeff 2.0, cycling through some of the former experiences,.... house 2.0, career 2.0, car 2.0, child responsibilities 2.0, all beautiful and perfect,... better than ever, but I just feel like I want to be hyper-cautious not to rinse and repeat my former mistakes.  \n\nI've accidentally stumbled upon a better understanding of the Taoist yin and yang symbol and it's underlying philosophy; The two perfectly symmetrical serpent-like swirls, one black and one white, symbolizing chaos and order.  It's been said or interpreted that a good life lives somewhere on the border of chaos and order.  In fact, there is a small white dot on the black side that will instruct the most chaotic of lives that you can visualize what the order of a good life looks like.  In turn, there is a black dot in the orderly life that reminds us that the best lives will always have a sprinkle of chaos and challenge.  If you live in complete order on the white side, you lack the challenges and are not provoked into risk taking that might allow you to stretch yourself and undertake new and exciting adventures.  If I could summarize the black dot in and orderly life, it is my wife and I watching Anthony Bourdain traveling to Vietnam and us having an intriguing conversation afterwards about what it would take to sell everything and go live there!  Humans long for a certain amount of risk.  It sparks that primal dopamine bump that reminds you that a significant reward could be on the other side.\n\nWhen I was drinking, I was the unsustainable \"whole\" of the Taoist symbol.  I didn't live on the border of chaos and order, I tried to heavily play the role on each side.  Outwardly, I was maintaining a company, paying bills, loving my wife, and raising a good kid.  Inwardly, I was chasing risk, planning my next drunken spree.  In my mind, passing the DMV to get my license renewed because there was always a liquor store two blocks ahead.  And it wasn't that life was bad.  The heavy swings of responsibility contrasting with utter adolescent behavior was its own adventurous game, but the turmoil of hypocrisy in my mind was the torture that was unsustainable.  If your virtue is honesty, you can't live in both places, and for me, if I continued to try, the chaos would win. \n\nThe thing about great memories, the memory of me designing and installing my yard in my twenties, is that you don't recognize them until 15 years later.  Right now I am not enthusiastic about producing the \"next thing\", about landing the next job, or installing the perfect shelving system in my garage.  I have a solid history of achievement in those areas and can't help to think that somehow addiction intertwined with them.\n\nInstead, I am interested in going inward.  I am interested in sitting here and writing this.  Perhaps the next great memory I will have 15 years down the road, will be the period of my life where I didn't create outwardly, but when I sat with what was happening on the inside.  \n\nMaybe I'm in my next great memory at this moment.  \n\nAnd maybe I am now rightfully sitting on the border of order and chaos, because shit, with me sitting here figuring out how my brain works, that landscaping is not going to complete itself.  So the danger of disappointing the HOA police is the \"new balance\"... and it's honest, and procrastination might be the \"new danger\"... and just the right amount of risk... and now I'll get a $300 fine from the homeowners instead of a $3,000 bill from my lawyer. \n\nAnd maybe today I'm creating a new best memory;  The day I learned that the sound that I was hearing was not a dull thud, \"blah\" or \"ehhh\".   It wasn't that at all... \n\nIt was the silent whisper of maturity.  \n\nIt's what wisdom sounds like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

   "selftext": "Hey fellow SD members!  Former poster, turned Lurker (read: drinking heavily), now returning poster.  A few months back I realized where my drinking was going was destroying my life, and worst off I was consciously watching it happen, and too afraid to stop it- After all, how could I phantom what life without a case of beer a day would look like. Before I digress down the rabbit hole I thought I would share a little bit of what help push me through my (recent) days and nights of withdrawals and what kept me pushing through.\n\nFor some slight context a little less than 10 years ago I was in my early-ish 20s and a Boston marathon qualifier.  While also already a heavy drinker at the time, I then was in the process of a divorce, followed by the 2008 market crash, losing my job, and ultimately a house foreclosure.\n\nFast forward to 2018.  I had put on about 40-50 pounds, still somewhat physically active but nothing like the 'old' me.  So..on to the math, and bare in mind these are just generalized numbers for sake of the post.\n\nBeer costs:  $17.08 per day.  This bought me a 18pk or 16oz cans (a pack of 24, 12oz cans) . \nBeer Calories: 102 calories per 12 oz = 2450 calories a day\n\nAverage calories burned per mile ran: 140 calories\nAverage calories required to burn per pound of fat: 3500 calories\n\nSo as I sought out help through a counselor, as I am also dealing with the emotional side effects that a decade+ of life destroying drinking will cause, I was able to put down on paper what for me was the perfect representation of how much alcohol was effecting my life and how the effects of quitting could be immediately observed.\n\nI could be saving about $500 a month, just in beer (let alone all the empty calories). With proper diet and exercise I could quickly cut out 2450 calories from the beer, combined with the average training run of 5 miles...and quickly I would be looking at ~3000 calories per day.  Yes, I see what you are thinking, I gotta eat something right?  Well, what I found from this new sense of not being perpetually hung over is that I was able to (on a weekend) cook nice breakfast burrito, prep all my breakfast food for the week to come, clean up after all the cooking, then deep clean the floors of my condo.  All of this within the span of 3 or 4 hours (7am -11am), where in the past I would have been probably still somewhat drunk, rolling out of bed at 11am looking for what ever was left of the night before and starting all over again.\n\nAnyways, I am sorry if this turned into a rambling tale, but I have taken so much inspiration for those have shared their tales and perspectives while I was finding the courage to face sobriety myself. and hopefully something in here can inspire others who might be facing the same worries I was.  Its only day 9 for me, but all I know is I didn't drink yesterday and I won't drink today, and I'll handle the next day/moment when it comes!\n\nTL;DR Getting sober can save a boat load of money over time, as well as help in getting back to a weight that I am comfortable with!  And hopefully regaining the marathon endurance and running strength I had years ago.",

I have a huge issue in my family of alcoholism and last night made me realize my \"hobby\" has become more of a habit. I know some people may call me a liar over this but it's true and very concerning to me. I polished off a half gallon of captain Morgan and was very surprised at the fact that I felt hardly anything. I became upset and drank straight shots to hopefully send myself into the land of forgetfulness and mistakes. I never reached that point. Never even got close. I hang around a group of people who I guess are \"enablers\" but I will put no blame on them, they are great people who enjoy a casual drink and are impressed by how much I can drink. I continued to drink until my friend who was hosting our weekly drunken get together ended it to go to bed. I finished well over a half gallon and roughly half of a fifth in the course of 2-3 hours and only just began to feel tipsy. I got an uber home and as soon as I laid down next to my wife I began to realize, I really might be an alcoholic. My friends and I have done our drunken get togethers since we all left for college, the military, and regular civilian workforce years ago. What started out as a yearly get together became a monthly get together which became a weekly one. That led to my daily \"get together\" with alcohol. Let me reiterate that I do not and will not put any blame on my friends but I truly do see that I've associated having a good time with them as one where I am having a bottle. Do any of you have any tips on how to kick this and keep my friends? If I need to cut my friends I will, nothing will stand between my wife and I, but I know for a fact that I am the only one out of my pretty tightly knit group of friends who struggles in this way. I admit, shamefully, that i really think I need help. How did any of you quit drinking? How did you keep your friends? Most importantly though, if you have done this, how did you admit to your significant other and/ or friends that you're struggling and need help? I know that a lot of this is pride based, but that's a large issue for me. I view my issue as something that I need to grow out of and that's why I only actually feel comfortable hiding behind a username. I hope I am not wasting any of your time.

I could not even recognize myself.  I am a solid 50lbs overweight.  In the past year I have tried every diet and exercise program, to lose 10 or so but then to immediately gain it back\\- and I was in full denial that the culprit was my bottle a of wine a night, more on weekends.\n\nI kept thinking back and trying to remember when the glass or so a night became a bottle a night\\- and when did I started sneaking wine into the house so no one knew how much I was really drinking, and when did the kids start complaining about having to stop for wine AGAIN, when did I start wanting to bail on family events so I could go sit at home and drink wine for 3 hours??  It crept up in the past 2.5 years but became a slow and steady, ugly addiction.\n\nAnd then a month ago, that picture, and a week day night of 1.5 bottles, followed by a terrible hangover at work, I said seriously\\- enough and found this sub.  I have gone through the day 1 posts with you, the 5 day posts, the 2 week posts, the posts of struggles that are the struggles I have daily, and here I am.

I hope to lose another 30 or so.  And like so many, what a feeling to wake up without guilt\\- thinking who did I text, what did I post?!?!  Or waking realizing I didn't pack lunches or help with homework, or that my little guy fell asleep in his clothes because I didn't pay attention and get him ready for bed\\- it's a heavy burden that I will bear for a long, long time.  It breaks my heart.  All I ever wanted to be was a mom, and here in their prime childhood years  I was a shell of who I could be for them, and it's so painful.  I love them more than anything on this entire earth.  \n\nBut now I'm the mom I was years ago.

   "selftext": "I'm sharing an excerpt from one of my favorite Al-Anon books, *Opening Our Hearts, Transforming Our Losses*. [A chapter can be read here.](https://al-anon.org/blog/opening-hearts-transforming-losses) \n\n\n**Changing the dynamics of our relationships**\n\n\nIn Al\u2011Anon we learn how to set boundaries, to say yes when we mean yes, and no when we mean no. We no longer give to others out of obligation, control, or fear, but because we want to give. Once we begin to take better care of ourselves, we can begin to give to others in healthier ways.\n\n\nRecognizing our part in the alcoholic relationship is a crucial component of our recovery. Before we can make positive changes, we must first become aware of the dynamics of the relationship and the role we\u2019ve been playing. Perhaps we were enablers who rescued or made excuses for the alcoholic. Or we may have seen ourselves as victims, helpless to change our circumstances. Maybe our role was to accept all the blame for the alcoholic\u2019s drinking or bad behavior, apologizing for anything that went wrong. Some of our conduct made a bad situation worse.\n\n\nWe examine our role in the family disease not to blame ourselves, but rather to deepen our understanding and compassion for those parts of ourselves we want to change. We cannot break our old patterns without such understanding. Rather than continuing to feel responsible for others, we begin to take responsibility for ourselves and our own actions. We did the best we could at the time with the resources we had, but now that we are aware, we can see another way. As we apply the principles of our program to our day\u2011to\u2011day lives, we begin to respond to situations differently than we had in the past. We give up our illusions of control and our belief that we can change the alcoholic forced sobriety.\n\n\nAs we begin to change, so too will our relationships not just with the alcoholic, but with everyone around us. In any relationship, when one person changes, the entire relationship is altered. Just as we have been affected by the family disease of alcoholism, those around us will be affected by our recovery as we begin to heal. Even though we may want a change in our relationship, the change itself can be a loss.\n\n\nNot everyone will be happy about the new changes in us including ourselves at times. We may reminisce about how things used to be and may even try to convince ourselves that things weren\u2019t so bad before recovery. We can expect a temporary period of upset or increased crisis at this time. This doesn\u2019t mean we should go back to the way things were, though we may be feeling pressure to do so. Positive changes don\u2019t always feel right at first. On those days when going back may seem easier, we can trust that our Higher Power has guided us to this point in our lives. We are precisely where we need to be.",

However, I think that part of my mental illness is to shift the focus to weight loss \\(not that I really need to lose any more\\), not alcohol, and that allows my alcohol soaked brain to rationalize that only 1 or 2 boxes, if I skip dinner, won\u2019t really make me fat, so..... yeah, you get it.\n\nI\u2019m basically 100&amp;#37; A\\-OK all day with the exception of the late afternoon/ early night window, where my brain attacks me with every single reason why I should have some wine 'just tonight\u2019. For me, if I can push through the window of 5\\-7 pm, the rest of the night is easier settled into my routine in my night clothes. Then it\u2019s MUCH less likely that I will make a wine run. Sometimes, depending on what\u2019s up, that window does expand to about 3:30 to maybe 8. So a max of 4.5 hours, but usually just 2 \\- and it\u2019s that stretch of time, in spite of feeling calm and confident all the rest of the day, that really do me in.\n\nIn addition to the health reasons for quitting, I have been emotionally absent from my husband and children for years, and honestly, we\u2019re seeing the effects at this point. I have become almost reclusive, not wanting to go anywhere or do anything other than come home, sit in my corner, drink and watch something or read \\(if I\u2019m not too blurry\\). This is really a big thing for me. It was a breakthrough in March, when I invited my husband to accompany me on a business trip. For 2 of the 3 nights, I had minimal, pretty much normal consumption of a couple of glasses, but blew it on the middle night, sucking down a whole, super expensive bottle of wine in the stall of the lobby ladies room. So stupid, and missed a great dinner. Roller coaster \\- up and down and up and down.\n\nTrying to make it stick this time, it\u2019s May 4, and I haven\u2019t had a drink all month \\(all 3 nights!\\). I\u2019ve joined this Reddit group \\(my first\\), gotten the Nomo app on my phone, and I read the Flipboard alcoholism articles every day. I also write in my diary, still titled, \u2018Dry January\u2019. ha. It really, really helps me get through the bewitching hours, if I have done this \u2018work\u2019. When I don\u2019t do it, I\u2019m much more likely to rationalize and blow it.\n\nI am glad I joined this group, because you all sound so lovely, non judgmental, and supportive in your comments to folks who struggle on this front.",

   "selftext": "Hey everyone.  I made this account to post here since I want to stay anonymous.  Sorry if it's long and rambly.\n\nOver the last six years, my drinking has gotten pretty out of control.  Addiction runs in both sides, so I had pretty much 0% chance to be able to control it.  I knew that, but I started anyway.\n\nAt first it was just a couple beers or whatever was cheap, ostensibly to help me sleep since I worked third shift and had trouble sleeping since I was a teen.  Maybe a couple times a week.\n\nThen it became daily.\n\nThen it became much larger volumes.  I switched to vodka and cheap whiskey, and pretty soon I was going through at least a fifth a day.  I once did an entire handle every day for a week.  Once I had that first drink, I couldn't stop until I couldn't stay awake any longer. My control over it was just enough that I still made it to work on time, but the negative effects on my body and personality started piling up.\n\nI'm married, and we just had a baby, our first, in February.  My ability to hide it kept getting worse.  At one point the two of them spent over two weeks at my in-laws' house, rather than being here, because of it. I still went over there to see my daughter every day, but they didn't come home with me.\n\nI kept telling my wife \"I'll stop, I'm done\", only to jump right back into it.  I hated myself for lying to her like that, but the urge was overpowering.  Then came Easter this year; my mom, who is also an addict, had about two bottles of wine, made a fool of herself, and nearly dropped my daughter when holding her more than once.  I told myself that was it for me. \n\nI finally saw a doctor, who prescribed me Librium (chlordiazepoxide) to keep me from going through withdrawals while quitting. \n\nHe also prescribed me Naltrexone to help with cravings, a six month trial period -- if I wanted to keep using it, I'd have to start going to peer meetings.  I thought I could do it without that; I'm not a very social person and I have an even harder time asking for help.\n\nI made it for two and a half days on the Librium alone before relapsing.  \n\nFinally, yesterday, I woke up after another binge with a bottle next to me and a series of angry texts from my wife.  Not the first time.  But I've decided it's the last time.\n\nAs of right now I haven't had a drink in 24 hours.  This time tomorrow it'll be 48.  I'll be checking in daily for a little while, and plan to be active in this sub.  I need to get my health back, for myself, and for my marriage, my daughter, and her future siblings.  I don't want them to have any memory of their dad like this, and in ten years I want to be so far removed from it that it's like it happened to someone else.  \n\nBut I won't forget that it happened.  Thanks for reading. I hope to be able to support, and be supported by, this sub for a long time to come.\n\n",

   "selftext": "Hi, all! I am a longtime lurker often inspired by everyone's posts and support. I think of this as a place I would walk by on my way to make bad decisions; a place welcoming me to enter but I just wasn't ready.\n\nI will try to spare my Gays of our Lives sob story. The cliffs notes version is that my roommate of two years and I became romantic last summer. He was very promiscous before me; I am seven years his senior; there is a lot of STUFF that happened before this; I fell out of love with him at the same time he realized he was in love with me. Men are like that.\n\nI used to be the fun drunk who hosted parties and knew everyone at the club by name and I was friendly and popular and I just liked to FLIRT.\n\nI become a very angry, raging, vengeful drunk around him. I am ridiculously non-confrontational when sober. Now I combine one drink and Adderall (which I take as prescribed, not abusing) and I just get downright scary, and all the stuff I kept inside comes out. \"Oh, yeah? Well in November 2016 when you demanded my 120-pound ass to move the bookshelf and I moved the wrong one, you sent me a rude text about it and it HURT MY FEELINGS! FUCK YOU!\"\n\nWe got in a fight at the club in front of everyone last night at the RuPaul's Drag Race party! He was Eureka and I was The Vixen. Even security came over. We got home and beat the crap out of each other. I slapped him like I was Stephanie McMahon. He shoved me into the cabinet and I hit the back of my head. I scream at him every time I drink (since November). When I am sober, I clam up because I feel too sad and defeated to argue. The only reason the upstairs neighbor doesn't call the cops on us is because he wants to screw us. (Sad but true, and it's NOT going to happen)\n\nI am moving back home for at least a month and I am producing a play this summer and my goal is to not drink until Pride (last weekend of June). I know I should say until forever. I've been in therapy and advised to go to substance abuse counseling. Forever is too scary! I tell myself that if this person leaves my life, I won't be this way anymore. Deep down I know that's crap. Last week he was on vacation and my drunk ass blocked him on social media just to prove ... Something.\n\nI don't want to do this anymore. I am sad and ashamed all day. I have the right to have feelings but I don't have the right to treat another person this way. I am late for work every Friday. It is a miracle I am employed. Carrie Fisher said she didn't figure out she was bipolar until she quit drinking, because alcoholism and drug use are so similar that you have to be sober before you can differentiate it from other mental illness. And even if I'm actually bipolar, I can't use it as an excuse to be an incompetent manchild who is an asshole to his quasi-boyfriend.\n\nThank you all for letting me share. Keep doing what you're doing!\n\nIWNDWYT",

   "selftext": "Hi everyone, my wife is an alcoholic. She does not drink everyday. She'll have periods of sobriety that generally last 2 to 8 weeks at the most. When she does drink, it's not always obvious. Sometimes she just seems slightly off and it might be because of drinking but it might also be because she's tired or depressed.\n\nAnyway, I recently discovered that I can track her whereabouts through Google's Location History, which uses the GPS in her phone to show where she has been. She is logged into her Google account on our family computer and I often look and see if she has been to the liquor store. I just checked it and although she is working today, it shows she went to the liquor store at lunch.\n\nI'm really torn on this behavior. On the one hand, I think it is useful for me to know if she has been drinking so I can plan accordingly. For example, we are going to dinner with her parents tonight. Knowing she won't be sober allows me to prepare myself, both from an emotional perspective but also practical (for example, I can now make sure she doesn't drive tonight). However, I know that tracking her like this is a sign that I am not accepting this situation for what it is, and I am possibly trying to control her.\n\nWould love to hear some feedback from others, thanks.",

But being an alcoholic increases the risk of getting cancer and needing chemotherapy.  \n\nHonestly, my first year, there were a lot of emotions ranging from joy to despair, but there was also a lot of loss, guilt, and regret over not being able to drink.  There was also a lot of jealousy towards people that are still drinking.  Are these rational, no but that doesn't negate their existence.  \n\nDrinking on a Friday was a guarantee.

I explained to her that I was not going to be drinking (other than our planned Napa winery tour) any longer because I realized I have a drinking problem.

Alcoholics need to drink, you just get too drunk.\"\n\nI'm not sure if she's rationalizing for her own sake, but it made me think back to that post the other day about alcoholics vs people who have a drinking problem - hah! Right.\n\nI'm feeling pretty great. Only a half a can of beer this workweek. One challenge I'm facing, though, is judging/trying to influence my SO's drinking habits. I get that he is his own person and I may be more judgmental now that I'm abstaining, but I'm genuinely concerned that he has a drinking problem as well. Not sure how to proceed, but everything will work out. \n\nTLDR; mom made me laugh when she told me I'm not an alcoholic (frequency), I just drink to much (quantity)\n\nMay the 4th be with you!

We talked about drinking early on in our relationship and decided we saw too much negative in drinking and we generally don't drink.  Socially maybe every other month.  However part of that has been with our neighbor, one of my friends who is a hard core alcoholic.  Hard. Core.  She drinks all night, sleeps till 5 or 6 pm.  Her spouse is very unhappy and I know from our private conversations that dumping her is on the table, but she has invested so much, she is reluctant to pull the trigger.\n\nSkip ahead, I am becoming bothered by the fact she texts my spouse (he's a gay man, she's a lesbian) at 3AM to come drinking.  Not that anything came of it as he slept through it, but I am bothered by the fact she thought it was appropriate.  We are neighbors, which kind of exacerbates this.\n\nLast weekend she texted at 1AM when we were still awake, but I still think this was not something \"decent\" people should do.  It had been a month since we had anything to drink so I begrudgingly said let's go, he ended up staying and drinking till 10AM.\n\nI feel like she wants to groom him to be her drinking buddy.  She probably perceives me as being able to support us both just as her wife does, so they can while away the nights drinking.  I told him before we went that I wouldn't have alcohol change our plans again (of course the next day is lost after a night of drinking).\n\nMy question is has anyone seen this grooming behavior before, where someone detects a predisposition to drinking as my husband has and tries to exploit it?  I am considering saying we can't socialize with them any more because you can't ask an alcoholic to be responsible with alcohol in any way, certainly not because it will harm someone else.  This has blindsided me, though it's not truly a problem yet, it's bothering me a lot.  I hate to end a marriage in short order, but I won't have alcohol be a point of contention in my marriage.  I now it's futile.  He has never drunk enough to really crave it or have a routine, but when it's around and he's started, he only wants more.  Nothing matters.  For that reason we simply don't drink and he doesn't miss it as long as he hasn't started, but multiple texts offering it can make a difference, especially if they are well-timed on a weekend.\n\nDo any recovered alcoholics have input?

Andrew and Pete said 'You did so good (My name)' 'good job' etc. Then I could just feel them looking at me the whole time. Then I was walking back from the oval, Cameron (annoying kid that Andrew was talking to) came up to me and started talking to me which is normal, anyway then Andrew and Pete yelled out \"Oi, are you guys dating\", I just walked ahead of Cameron a bit cause I don't like Cameron at all, and I don't want any rumours. Then I heard them say \"Are you on the pill?\" \"Are you a virgin\"\n\nLike what's all this mean?? All these dudes are in the same group btw. The thing is...I sorta have a crush on their friend who's a lot different, he told these dicks to stop when they were harassing me and he has just got a kinder nature. Any ideas on why they're doing these things? What should I do? We're all around the same age, they're around 15, I'm nearly 16. But we're in the same grade. My friends don't really care, they just ignored me when I told them. I'm just looking for insight..maybe from 15 yo boys to get a perspective on it. Any advice is helpful!",

This was my first time being around alcohol since starting a week ago, but I felt comfortable since I was with her. I even left the event and came back to go to a meeting. Afterwards, me and my friends from the studio went to eat pizza and it was a really fun night. \n\nThe issue is when one of my friends who I knew would be coming to the art festival texted me while I was in my meeting and I called her once I got out to see where she was. This is the friend that had to help my mom find me last weekend bc I tried to drive home and ended up passing out right off an exit that wasn't even close to where I live and she knows I've started going to AA. When I told her I was at a meeting, I could almost hear her rolling her eyes and she was like \"you aren't an alcoholic, you're just doing what you do sometimes, trying to be different and special, but whatever makes you feel better, I support you.\" I ended up meeting up with her before going back to my studio friends, but could tell she was idk not into talking to me?\n\nShe was drinking and I think she was kind of drunk so I think that had something to do with it. Her drinking doesn't bother me and I told her that when I first started all this. What bothered me was her thinking I'm what? going to AA and not drinking for attention??? Like how could anyone see what I went through last weekend and be like nah that's totally normal drinking right there. \n\nWhat would you say if this was your friend? She actually is one of my very best friends so I guess that's why this is bothering me. Guess I just needed to vent for a second too, thanks for reading. ",

   "selftext": "Hi SD. I've been lurking here a while (mostly at 3am after blackout benders, or the day after, hungover and filled with regret). My relationship with alcohol has been a strange one. I don't drink on a nightly basis, more like 2-3 nights a week when the weekend rolls around, and I drink heavily - often on my own. I will drink bottles of wine in my room watching netflix by myself and smuggle out the bottles so my roommate doesn't find out. Every time I get inspired and aim to get fit or start a new hobby, i am derailed by friday night and the lure of a bottle of wine or scotch and comfy oblivion. I can't just do a glass or two of wine. If its there I will finish it. I am a small woman and the amount I drink is more than most men I know. \n\nToday i discovered alcohol is a class 1 carcinogen. What the fuck? How have I never heard that before??? Is that the worlds best kept secret or what?\n\nI think about all the things I could acheive without this poison in my life and it makes me so sad. I miss having hobbies. Alcohol is my hobby. I miss having friends. Alcohol is my friend. And a shitty one at that. I seem to pick alcohol over life every time. I can't do it anymore. My skin is awful, my hair is awful, i am skinnyfat and unfit. I want to be good at my job, study my masters, travel, save money, eat good food, explore the outdoors, meet new people. Instead I am stuck in groundhog week and it always ends the same way.\n\nHow do you meet new people who want to do more than just hang out and drink when you're in your 20s? Tonight I have a party to go to and I intend to bring nonalcoholic ginger beer. I need to make a change and put life - real life - first. I don't want 25 yrs to pass and still be a sad binge drinking sack of shit who chooses alcohol every time. I need to change.\n\nI will not drink with you today.",

   "selftext": "As a newbie in this community if just like to throw some thoughts off mine out into the oblivion about nofap, pmo and masturbation. Having had a look through the sub a bit, it's quite interesting to see the dynamic between the 'hardcore' (for want of a better word) who abstain from all forms of masturbation in addition to regular pmo, and the 'moderates', who hold that masturbation in moderation is not necessarily bad, only pmoing and porn addiction. Occasionally a discussion post comes up, and both sides have at it. \n\nFor me the debate centres around two points: the slippery slope of masturbation and the nature of porn itself. Apologies for leaving out the somewhat controversial superhero/energy/metaphysical argument, which definitely merits investigation.\n\nThe big point from the hardcore side is the connection between masturbation and porn. Their argument could be best summed as masturbation especially for recovering porn addicts like ourselves is very dangerous because it could lead to a relapse in the whole no pmo thing. As one user put it \"us masturbating is like an recovering alcoholic walking into a pub\". In my experience this is a very valid point as many times before joining nofap I have tried to quit porn, but relapsed into masturbation, then pmoing to softcore stuff, before finally going back to my old ways.\n\nI haven't really found a counter to this argument from the moderates, though I would be completely open to considering one of anyone has got one. The closest I have seen the moderate come to negating this point is the argument that masturbation in moderation can be a helpful way to release sexual frustration that if left unchecked could lead to a pmo relapse. Going back to my experience, I'll readily admit I feel daunted by the prospect of no sexual outlet for (hopefully) 90 days or longer.\n\nHowever, I feel that this angle places too much importance on the institution of sex and sexual activity in our lives. Of course, sex is a massive part of the human experience. Biologically, or goal is to produce offspring. Yet we are not apes. We have developed extremely complex cultural institutions in our societies, which for me means that the importance of sex and sexual activities in self fulfilment lessens in my opinion. We must also remember that institutions such as corporations, searching for profit, wish to engage our primal desires like sex and magnify their importance, so that these desires destroy our ability to make rational decisions. We all experience this every day in the media, pop culture etc. So I would say it would be beneficial to stop looking to sex and masturbation for fulfilment and instead find other things in our complex society with which to engage with (lol that is the worst sentence I've ever worded).\n\nFinally, I want to look at the actual act of masturbation. Watching porn simulates the act of sex and eases our ability to orgasm. But think about what you do when you masturbate without porn. In your head you try to simulate yourself with your memories of porn you have watched. For me I struggle to see the difference. You're just replaying the porn 'in your minds eye'. I'm no neuroscientist but I suspect this may have the same effect on the brain's wiring as regular pmo does.\n\nSorry this is a bit of a ramble, it's 10 pm and I'm tired af. Being a 15 with no prospect / intention of engaging in sexual intercourse in the near future does daunt me but I think the challenge of reducing the importance of seed counter to the prevailing culture motivates me.\n\nCheers, a humble nofapper",

As I sit on my porch at 8:30am, drinking coffee without nursing a hangover, sitting next to a packed cooler, I thought I'd share my situation with you fine people.\n\nToday is DAY 20! It really seems hard to believe I made it this far, and relatively painlessly. A small part of my mind is telling me, \"That's because you're in control now, you did it! Have a responsible drink to celebrate.\" Thankfully I've learned (the hard way) to ignore that, as it is just the addiction talking. \n\nToday is also the Kentucky Derby, which, if you're not from Louisville, KY or the surrounding area, you may not know just how big of a deal it is around here. The official celebration kicks off two weeks before the race with the largest annual fireworks show in North America, called Thunder Over Louisville. Between then and now, there are an increasing number of events, from marathons to parades to fancy parties. One thing that is present at every turn: booze. It's as if alcohol fuels the Kentucky Derby...\n\nToday I'll be attending the annual Derby party of a family friend. They've been hosting the same party since the 80s, and I've been going since I was in college (there's a strict 'no kid' policy)... Boy have I gotten fucked up at this thing. It'll be a challenge to be surrounded by people passing bottles around, with the liquor and beer flowing freely. Here, nobody judges you for overindulging... They just sit you back up, brush off your jacket and hand you a fresh beer.\n\nI volunteered to DD for my cousin, so that I would have a good reason to stick to non-alcoholic beverages. I bought a delicious local ginger ale to drink so that it would feel like a special occasion (I usually don't drink soda of any kind). I'm going to read a chapter of This Naked Mind before I leave for the party. \n\nI think I'll be good to go today, but I wanted to post my commitment here to make it official. Thank you as always for your support, and know that even for the Kentucky Derby, I will not drink with you today!\n\nBonus: [My cooler for the day!](https://i.imgur.com/VEgWxto.jpg)",

   "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI would like your advice.\n\nAlcoholism runs in my maternal family. My uncle fucked up his life because of the alcohol, and maybe my grandmother, mother and other uncle are alcoholic. (Right now I'm dating a \"recovered\" alcoholic.)\n\nI had my first beer (accidentally) at 9 years old. I didn't drink again until I was 19 or something like that. Right now I am 24.\n\nI've always been afraid of alcohol, of drunk people and of getting drunk. There are countless reasons for this. But I've always known that I COULD be an alcoholic because of my genes.\n\nI've become quite fond of beer and like pretty much any alcohol, except vodka. However, I only drink in very controlled environments: alone, with my mother, or with my boyfriend.\nIn the last five years or so, I've built up my tolerance to the point where I can happily drink 6 common beers, 6 shots of brandy, 2 glasses of wine, and still be fine. (I weigh about 49 kilograms, or 108 pounds and I am a female) Beers are like water for me now, but I avoid drinking with coworkers or strangers in general because I'm afraid they'll judge the amount. \nI like beer (and the other alcohols) because of the taste. I am quite selective and try to become an expert in beer. I do not drink for the sake of the effects of alcohol, which I do not experience and do not wish to. At most, I'll feel dizzy and I'll stop. But that doesn't really happen anymore. Also, I drink a lot of water while I'm consuming alcohol.\n\nIn a week, I drink two to four days. Usually it's anything between a normal beer to six beers per day. So there are weeks when I consume 2, and weeks when I drink about 24 beers. Normally it's about 6 beers per week. \n\nI do not feel anxious if I cannot drink, and I have a lot of chronic health issues going on, but my first question is to the doctors is: \"Can I still drink while I'm on this medicine?\" Beer is the only thing I actually WISH to ingest; for some reason I've lost interest in food. I eat, but I'd rather drink. I can afford my consumption. I have always been a responsible student and employee. But a doctor said that, because of the amount of alcohol I drink per week, I qualify as an alcoholic.\n\nIs this possible?\nAm I an alcoholic in denial?\nDo I need help?\n\nSorry for the length and thank you.\n",

I do not question this as, for as many of those out there whom have been afflicted with alcoholism, there are just as many who have no trouble understanding and managing their relationship with the abuse of the universally-accepted substance.\n\nThe cure for a physical addiction is simply to reduce/deny consumption. After physical addiction has been omitted, it leaves only the psychological aspect of the behavior. (The real beast for most of us) At this point, alcohol, like many drugs that immediately give the user a sense of reward and spiritual fulfillment, can be used to achieved exactly this: Purpose and a reason for being. Further touching on the human sense of work and reward, it's no wonder that we celebrate great achievements with champagne, wine, and spirits. Alcohol stimulates the reward center of our brains. Humanity knows this. We've known this for thousands of years.\n\nA noticeable pattern in those with a great affinity for alcohol is that they: Not able to achieve great fulfillment in their day-to-day lives, have built the habit of becoming dependent on the sense of reward given to them by the consumption of alcohol. As the reward is of a chemical nature existing within our brains, it is no less real than the true rewards we achieve in our endeavors.",

I have to stop my unhealthy type drinking, ie drinking alone, out of feelings, etc. I have been told I can \u201chave a beer or a glass of wine if I\u2019m out with friends or family for dinner, or for a special occasion, etc.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m \u201cabout\u201d a week in.

In the long run, I don\u2019t think it matters if it was Sunday or Wednesday, but in the beginning it doesn\u2019t matter to me, and I\u2019m just moving forward.\n\nWine is my drink of choice- I\u2019m going to miss it. But I\u2019m excited to start this adventure. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen! I can\u2019t believe how much time has flown by where I was just drinking myself away.

   "selftext": "Here's the gist of it...my boyfriend has struggled with alcohol fairly consistently for the past year (he's 30). In January of this year, his family had enough and told him if he didn't go to rehab, they were choosing to disconnect from him. He obliged, but I feel it was only because he didn't want to lose them. He completed a 30-day rehab during the beginning of this year, and things were good for a couple of months.\n\nFast forward to April of this year...I found he had Kratom and Phenibut that he said he was using to help keep him away from alcohol. I believe he has been abusing both of these substances, and this past week found a bottle of vodka.\n\nHere's my question--his family and myself have had enough, and it's getting to the point that this is dangerous. Before he went to rehab, he was hospitalized with a BAC of .37. If it gets back to that point, there's no telling what could happen. I am thinking of confronting him and then leaving until he decides to get serious about being sober. His family has written letters to him (they're in a different state) which will be presented to him in a couple of days. Is it too much to pull everything out from under him at once, i.e., family and myself (we've been together 6 years), or should I just leave first and then if he still doesn't get help, bring his family in?\n\nAs of this posting, he does not know that his family or myself know he has been continuing to drink / use Kratom.",

   "selftext": "I\u2019ve tried to write this a few times... it probably won\u2019t make a ton of sense because i can\u2019t make sense of it yet. \nMy husband is an alcoholic. \nWe\u2019ve been together for almost 4 years. A one night stand led to a pregnancy and we started dating from there. Our oldest son is 3 and we have a 4 month old. \nHe used to drink everyday and through me trying to control the situation that slowed down a lot but he still binge drinks. \nIn January when i was pregnant the baby stopped moving. I went to the hospital and he was born via c section 7 weeks early and spent a month in the nicu. When he was a week old my husband asked me to come home from the hospital early so we could spend time together.. i walked in the door and he walked out. He came home drunk and mean. He told me he had hoped i would bleed out from my c section and that he didn\u2019t care about the baby. All in front of our screaming toddler I left. I stayed with my parents for a few days and then he sucked me back in. He went to aa for the first time and i thought he would get better. He stopped drinking. It lasted 2 weeks. He would have one here and there and i didn\u2019t like it but i thought as long as he isn\u2019t drunk.... i guess. \nHis birthday was Thursday, he went to the bar to watch the playoff hockey game. I had a bad feeling but i let him go. I\u2019m not his keeper. My toddler woke up at 230 and i realized my husband wasn\u2019t home yet. I called. No answer. This is bad. 10 minutes later i heard a bang on the window. He\u2019s standing outside holding his shoe, swaying. I let him in, he flops on the couch and he is incoherent. I try to talk to him, it\u2019s like he didn\u2019t even know i was there. Then he stood up and walked outside to the back lane and lay down. I called 911 and my dad. The firefighters and my dad arrived at the same time. He was angry now. Our toddler is witnessing this. It took 4 firefighters and my dad to restrain him. They called the police. They asked if he could come in and go to sleep. I said absolutely not, and they handcuffed him and took him to the drunk tank. My toddler was trying to put his boots and jacket on to go with his dad. He saw him handcuffed. It was devastating. \nHe called me in the morning, mad, yelling. He thought the police beat him up. He beat himself up. I watched him. Punching himself and the stucco on the house. \nHis parents picked him up and brought them to their place out of town. His mom asked if they could bring my toddler too. I said no. I told his parents that he needs rehab, and until he does, he can\u2019t come home or see the boys. They said no. They would bring him home in the morning and we would all talk. They said he needs the boys. I talked to his sister and she agreed with me. I invited her to come the next morning. \nMy husband slept for 18 hours. He texted me in the morning asking to take my toddler for a few days. I said no. He asked if he could come home. I said i wasn\u2019t sure. \nHe came home, packed a bag and left. His parents are scared for our safety so his sister is staying with me and he boys for a few days. Then they will take over.\nHis parents have been his biggest enablers, with me in second place. I\u2019m done though. I can\u2019t love scared anymore. I can\u2019t placate him to avoid his meltdowns. It\u2019s not healthy for me or our kids. \nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next, but I\u2019m weirdly calm. I feel at peace with it. Though i am scared he will go out and drink and then get into the coke and OD. But i can\u2019t let that sway me anymore.\nI\u2019m either going to have a husband who is a recovering alcoholic and working towards better mental health or I\u2019m going to have an alcoholic ex husband. This is my life. I\u2019m going to live it healthily and happily. Whatever it takes.",

   "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm not really sure if this is the place, but I'm worried about my friend's happiness and wanted to see if others who are in/have been in a situation similar to hers could share experiences me to help me understand and know how to approach this. I understand that you do not offer advice here, only suggestions and support/personal experiences. That's the kind of thing I'm after.\n\nMy best friend is the most vibrant, incredible, bright, talented young woman. She is genuinely an exceptional person. Last year she dated this guy, Matt, and they were together for almost a year. Matt is an alcoholic who seems to accept this about half of the time, and still thinks he doesn't have a problem the other half.\n\nMy friend broke up with him after too many repeated disappointments (making commitments and not showing up because of drinking, lying or avoiding truths, not putting in any effort to certain parts of their relationship). During their relationship, he also gave her Herpes and lied about it twice before coming clean. She understands that this constitutes sexual abuse and was rightfully furious. This happened early in the relationship.\n\nHowever, after the break up, she was a wreck and very unhappy because she says she loves him so much and saw a future with him etc etc. I, along with other friends and family, was unbelievably relieved it was over, after seeing her constant disappointment and unhappiness. They stayed apart for a number of months, but now it looks like she's seriously getting back together with him.\n\nReddit, I know I can't control this, and I don't want to. But I really want to arm her with as much information as I can in a kind, supportive way before she commits to this. I've suggested she read stories online, but she says she doesn't like being slouched over a screen reading stuff like that cos it's depressing and doesn't vibe with her. She continues to downplay alcoholism, as if it isn't such a big deal after all, and is saying things like \"god sometimes I wish we could just run away together and everything would be okay.\" She says all relationships take compromise and maybe this is just their compromise (as if the other problem areas don't exist).\n\nShe also said to me, \"Surely there exist people who have happy relationships with addicts? They must be able to have fulfilling relationships too.\" I honestly don't know if happy, fulfilled relationships do exist with current (not recovering) addicts. I'm aware that those in long marriages/commitments must try very hard, so maybe it exists. I am just so concerned as she is so young and early days with him, even for a regular relationship a year is so short, and he is much older and doesn't have his life together (even aside from the alcoholism, that's just the part that really isn't his fault.) If she keeps trying to make this work, I'm worried that no one event will ever be \"bad\" enough to leave him even if she becomes miserable overall.\n\nSo my first question is, does anyone here have a positive story, a fantastic and healthy relationship with an alcoholic?\n\nIs there anything you would suggest I tell her or suggest to her before making the commitment that might help her make her decision?\n\nIs there anything that personal experience has taught you re establishing boundaries that helps IN the relationship, if she does choose to get back together with him?\n\nDo you have any suggestions for how I speak tactfully about this with her? I'm already trying to 1) never tell her what to do, just ask her questions and speak about my opinions of certain things, 2) never say anything bad about him as a person, and highlight that I'm sure he's a good person but this problem is large, 3. Always give a positive aspect before negative points (e.g. \"it's great that you're thinking so much about this before making a decision, at least whatever you choose you know you didn't take it lightly. I'm just concerned that...\"). Any feedback on this or ideas on how to present info would be great.\n\nTl;dr: 24yo friend probably getting back together with 36yo alcoholic ex who ruined their year-long relationship before by lying about drinking, avoiding commitments, and giving her an std and lying about it. Looking for any suggestions or experiences you have to share to help me put things into perspective/be a supportive friend. \n\nThank you!",

Usually I would like to stay in my university's city after my exams to chill out and spend time with friends but she guilt tripped me into booking a train down to visit her the day after my exams end so I can help her revise for her exams which end a couple of days after mine do. Whenever I try and bring it up she says stuff like \"if you want to stay at yours you can I don't want to keep you here if you don't want to stay\" which makes me feel awful for wanting some time to myself.\n\nAnd while we're staying at her place (which is a standard single bed university accomodation) we're literally in each others sight 24/7 but that's not enough for her. After a long day of studying I like to relax and watch some YouTube videos and have a beer to relax or whatever. She doesn't let me watch my videos because she wants us to watch something together so we end up watching whatever she wants to. And as for the beer apparently having 1 beer after a long day makes me an alcoholic.\n\nI really do love and care about her but recently I feel like putting her happiness and comfort first means sacrificing mine. And if I ever put myself first she says I don't care about her or that I'm insensitive. \n\nP.S. I had to stay in the library late to get the time to post this without her asking who I'm talking to or why I'm typing so much",

It hasn't been the most fun but it's effective, the hardest part was not drinking at home, which I've gotten used to.\n\nBoyfriend and I are going out with a friend tonight to a bar with an outside patio (lower energy vibe than a downtown bar or something). I'm not worried about anything, I've hung out with friends at bars before, but I'm starting to consider if I should experiment with getting something besides soda and water, which generally just leaves me bored and wanting to go back home.\n\nI know the perfect solution is to just.. not go to bars! But I'm 23, a lot of my friends do want to go hang out and have a beer somewhere.

They aren't bad friends or bad influences, they just aren't alcoholics, and they like casual drinking. I'd like some kind of solution to my sober antisocialness that isn't just \"don't go to bars\", because I'm fine being around alcohol but I do get a little bored around it.\n\nAre non-alcoholic beers or virgin cocktails worthwhile? I guess my only concern is that it'll begin me on the path of eventually drinking again a few months down the line. Like, step 1 in internally normalizing drinking again, which I don't want to happen. Maybe getting food would make it a more fun experience? ",

Then I notice the cat food bag was left a little open and I\u2019m worried it\u2019s stale and ruined.\n\nMy friend left me some bottles of wine which was super sweet of them but I don\u2019t like red wine. I was simultaneously annoyed that I don\u2019t like red wine, that I don\u2019t have a corkscrew, and that I\u2019m being ungrateful. A lot of times gifts stress me out for this reason. It\u2019s like I have another chore to do and I end up feeling guilty. It\u2019s not even a real problem but it stressed me out to this extreme level to where I feel like I have to find a way to open it NOW even though I\u2019m probably not even going to drink it? I even have another friend who would gladly take it off my hands but I still have to look at it for a few days. \n\nMy current fixation now is how my apartment doesn\u2019t look homey enough and I\u2019m resisting the urge to throw a bunch of things away. It\u2019s so weird, all day I looked forward to coming home, but because of a few minor things I feel like the whole place is ruined. Like I don\u2019t even want to be here. \n\nOn a happier note, I\u2019m starting a new job next week and will finally have health insurance again after almost a year. I\u2019m going to track down someone who does ERP because OCD is bullshit and I should be spending this time with my cats instead of freaking out over fake problems. ",

I felt really good and hopeful leaving the meeting.\n\nBut then something switched in my brain and suddenly I'm sobbing in my car, absolutely terrified for the days/weeks/years to come.\n\nPart of me really wishes I had never gone to a meeting at all. That I had never admitted I had a problem. That I never stated that dreaded phrase in a meeting out loud \"Hi, my name is Betharonic and I'm an alcoholic.\" That I could enjoy drinking like I used to. But like a woman said in AA earlier this week: \"After coming to AA, you'll never drink alone. You will drink with every person you've ever sat in a meeting with. They will be at the front of your mind.\"\n\nI really wish I was drunk at a bar. And I really wish my emotions would level out a bit. But I will not drink with you tonight. And I will hope tomorrow is better.",

   "selftext": "Little history...\nMy mother has been an alcoholic my whole life, she\u2019s done all kinds of things that I would never do to anyone. I was living with my mother and we had a fairly positive relationship, she stayed in her part of the house and we stayed in ours. About 4 years ago when my youngest daughter was 8 months old, we moved out with our stuff in trash bags and no where to go because she put us into a difficult predicament with her bad decisions. We are doing fine now but that was the start of her very big downfall. She owned her own home and in the last 6 months has lost it to the bank, she is still currently living there (bank is selling it this month) and has been for almost 2 months with no water or power. She has cirrhosis, malabsorption, and possibly pancreatitis. She\u2019s unable to walk or care for herself. She has an early onset of dementia that they call sundowners. DSS, the police, mental health, crisis support won\u2019t really help her because during the day she appears to be fine and can always tell them her name, birthday, and who the president is. She\u2019s constantly sitting around in a pile of her own feces and urine, today I discovered bedsores on her bottom. She\u2019s sleeps in blankets covered in fecal matter. Just today I\u2019ve committed my mother involuntarily into detox in hopes that when she comes out she can stay in the room we\u2019ve created for her so that she can try to get healthy again. We are non-drinkers though and have a VERY strict no alcohol rule. There are children in my home and I won\u2019t allow it. \n\nIf you read through it all, thanks I guess. Not sure what I\u2019m looking for but seemed like the place to write it. I wrote it all fairly quickly so if you did make it through it and have any questions, just ask. ",

   "selftext": "This is a long read, but I think it\u2019s worth the time for anyone who is either on the fence or who feels that they have this drinking thing whooped.\n\nBrief history: 38M, daily drinker for about 9-10 years, married, have an about to be 3 year old son. Heavy beer drinker ranging from 8-16 beers a night with 8-12 being the average. Busch ICE was my drink of choice (5.9%ABV).\n\nPrior to that, I had periods where I would drink less, but it was still pretty much daily, so about a 15 year drinking history. One DUI from 2006. Did all the usual scheming, planning, using alcoholic math, searching for couch cushions just to get a beer, etc.\n\nDrinking progressed over the past few years and got earlier and earlier to the point of drinking in morning just to get stable. Started developing very bad withdrawals so I HAD to keep them in check, eventually drinking beer from sun up till sun down (I work from home).\n\nAnyway, follow me on the yellow wave of alcoholic hepatitis and the fun few months I\u2019ve had.\n\nSo, back in January, I get this severe pain in my gut. I\u2019ve had plenty of URQ pain on and off for years, but this was painful and located in one small spot. Went to the doctor and he said it was a gastric ulcer. Also my liver was swollen and palpable (I knew this, obviously because it felt like carrying a football under my ribs).\n\nWe discussed my drinking and I told him I wanted to quit (which I did\u2026along with the so, so, so, so, so many other times I\u2019ve actually wanted to quit). He says detox, I say I can\u2019t. He says he can\u2019t prescribe anything because detox and withdrawal are tricky. I ask about tapering. He agrees and creates a five-week taper schedule. I get an ultrasound and blood work. Fatty liver and high enzyme counts.\n\nOk, so, this all sounds good. I know I now HAVE to do something because I can\u2019t deny an official diagnosis and I\u2019m sick of drinking and I can do this tapering thing.\n\nSo, I muddle through those five weeks and am not completely sticking to the plan. My problem was, \u201cOk, here\u2019s your allotment of beer for the day. You choose when to use it.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll have two now. Two hours later, another two. Uh oh, we\u2019re going to run out of beer. What if I get those horrible withdrawals. Better go to the store to make sure I have enough to start tomorrow. You can see how this all unfolded.\n\nAnyway, I stop and think. This isn\u2019t working. What if I looked at this from a medicinal angle. Look at it like a prescription. One beer every so many hours. And it worked! I started by saying one beer every two hours. A few days later, that became every three hours, and so on and so forth.\n\nI tapered down using this method , and by last week, I was down to two light beers a day and didn\u2019t even really care anymore. Whatever. Wasn\u2019t even thinking much about times at that point. I just stopped caring. So here I was, facing the finish line, no more withdrawals. After all these years, I was feeling freedom, I finally did it! This week, I\u2019m going with no beers. YES!!!! FREEDOM AT LAST!!\n\nSo, Tuesday of what was my last week of tapering, I catch my eye in the rearview mirror, WHAT THE HELL? Are my eyes yellow? I\u2019ve done the obsessive eye and skin checking in the past, but this looked different. I panic. Drive to pick up my son. Check eyes in mirror. Oh my GOD! This IS jaundice. Got home, check yes and skin. There\u2019s def jaundice.\n\nHow could this be?! I was doing better, I was drinking less in the past few weeks than I\u2019ve drank since I started drinking!!!\n\nSo, Wednesday rolls around and I mention it to my wife. She says she noticed too. Now I\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t feel any different, but my eyes are now glowing yellow and my upper body is starting to tint. I say I\u2019m going to give it one more day and then consider the hospital. Again, I felt completely normal, no changes, just yellow eyes and skin. That night, I developed this horrible dry cough. Looked into it. Phneumonia!\n\nSo, Thursday, I go to the local emergency room located in a quasi-clinic. They were very concerned and ran every test known to man on me. In the middle of my ultrasound, two nurses rush in with a pole and tons of bags on it. They yell out, \u201cWe have a SEPSIS PROTOCOL!\u201d I thought, \u201cMan, it\u2019s got to suck for whoever that\u2019s intended for.\u201d Well, that person was me.\n\nAt this point, I have jaundice, possible pneumonia, and now sepsis, all in the span of about 48 hours, all after I thought I was doing so, so good and was literally ready to be no beers at all. More tests were run, IVs and blood drawn, people rushing all over. Mind you, this was an emergency room at a small clinic hospital, so now I had to be transported to a larger hospital about 40 minutes away by ambulance. The night keeps getting better.\n\nWe arrive at the hospital and I\u2019m assigned to a room. More blood taken, more tests run, more questions to answer, and on and on. Throughout ALL of this, I felt fine. No pain, no sickness, nothing. The doctors were astonished I was talking, let alone joking and asking questions and being an alert human being.\n\nSo I\u2019m on the Progressive Care Ward, which is one step below being in ICU. I finally get a moment of peace when everyone leaves and I can sit quietly in a darkened room. I end up staying awake all night because of machines beeping and nurses and doctors constantly in and out to check on me and take vitals. I\u2019m hooked up to three IVs, getting pumped full of saline and antibiotics. My other hand is tethered to the vitals machine, so in order to get out of bed to do anything, I have to call for help to be unhooked.\n\nI decide it\u2019s easier to just pee in the jug they left. Guess what color my pee was? Iced tea! Fantastic. I\u2019ve always heard that it\u2019s really bad when your pee turns that shade of dark drown. And again, through all of this, I\u2019m still feeling fine.\n\nThe next day, after bag and bags of fluids and enough blood drawn to make Dracula blush, I get told they\u2019re moving me to the next floor (the normal patient floor). I get moved up and unhooked from machines. Here, I can walk freely about. I\u2019m hooked to one pole, but I can take it with me to the bathroom and down the hall and such. Yipee!\n\nThen comes more IVs and antibiotics, I\u2019m super duper yellow at this point, but still feeling fine. I end up having to explain the story no less than seven hundred times to seven hundred different nurses and doctors. One nurse asked why I didn\u2019t have any withdrawal symptoms. I said, \u201cUm, that was the point of the tapering\u201d.\n Then I got hooked up to the banana bag and had to sit in bed for over eight hours straight. And of course, more saline and more antibiotics. And of course, I\u2019M STILL FEELING THE SAME WAY I FELT WHEN I FIRST WALKED IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM\u2026FINE!\n\nThat night sucked because the bag finished and kept beeping and the nurse\u2019s assnt said she would get the nurse but it took over 45 minutes, so I walked out to the nurse\u2019s station and asked for help. The nurse didn\u2019t know what she was doing and restarted the machine\u2019s process, meaning I had to sit and left another hour\u2019s worth of fluids drain and THEN the machine would start beeping AGAIN. So I went back to my room, asked for an Ativan, and went to sleep.\n\nWoke up today and was still feeling fine. I asked the Dr. how this could happen if I was doing so good. I had cut down to two light beers. C\u2019mon! He said that it\u2019s likely my liver was just so damaged that even small jabs could have tipped it over the edge (Thanks for encouraging me to taper, original doc). We talked test results and it seems they caught the sepsis in time and that I didn\u2019t have pneumonia or any lung problems.\n\nHe said that, under normal circumstances, he\u2019d keep me, but since I seemed to be feeling so well, he would discharge me. He also stated that, before coming in and just looking at my number, he expected to find someone completely different in the bed, not someone standing up and walking around and talking. He also said that I still have a fatty liver and it was inflamed (hepatitis) due to the drinking and partially because of the sepsis. If I drink again, I\u2019m going to come back in even worse shape or be dead, even from a light beer).\n\nI explained that I had been committed to quitting prior to this and I\u2019m even more committed now. I went home, still feeling fine, and today marks day three of complete and utter, not-a-drop, sobriety, and I intend to keep it that way for good.\n\nI just wanted to share this to demonstrate that you never know where the line actually is, but once you cross it, you find out real quick. I considered the few days at the end of my taper to basically be sobriety considering how little I drank and how little I cared. But even something small can become a nuclear explosion just like that. The jaundice came on suddenly, there was no ramp up. And had it not been for the jaundice or that little itchy cough, I wouldn\u2019t have even gone to a Dr.\n\nThe lesson to learn? Quit now (safely). I fully believe in tapering, but if your liver has already said, \u201cI\u2019m angry, you might just be tempting the bull when you turn your back and let your guard down. Go see your doctor, be honest, and be logical about your decisions. I never, ever thought something weird like this could happen pretty much AFTER quitting, but it did. Never get too comfortable when it comes to the destructive power alcohol has over the body.\n\nIWNDWYT",

I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s so long, I\u2019ve got a lot to get off my chest. \n\nMy partner &amp; I bought a house together in September last year. At the time, I didn\u2019t fully comprehend how much of an alcoholic he was. He hid it well &amp; kept his job &amp; life mostly together. I\u2019d known he had a drinking problem, but it seemed he\u2019d kicked it, so we took the plunge together.\n\nIt took a few months for me to see the full picture. I\u2019ve since found out that he\u2019d never stopped drinking &amp; had been drinking at least two bottles of wine a day. More on weekends. It started to affect his health, he got scared &amp; asked for help. He\u2019s since been to rehab twice &amp; has been diagnosed with severe liver disease. He tried for a while after rehab, but he found excuses to fall off the wagon pretty quickly. He\u2019s now back to drinking every day. We don\u2019t know how long he\u2019s going to live for, but I know his drinking is bringing that day closer &amp; closer. He refuses to get help or try anymore because he\u2019s dying. If he stops drinking, he might live up to 15 years more. If not, it\u2019ll probably only be months. \n\nMy problem is, aside from it breaking my heart to see the man I love killing himself, I have two boys aged 9 &amp; 10. My ex husband &amp; divorced when my boys were pretty young &amp; when we moved in together it seemed like a chance for my boys to finally be part of a happy family household. My partner had his kids regularly too &amp; for a short while, we had all the happiness on the world. That didn\u2019t last long though. \n\nMy partner is not violent, but I don\u2019t want my kids to be living with a drunk. I\u2019ve done my best to shield them from this.

So, now when my partner is drunk (he often goes to bed/passes out), I tell them he\u2019s still sick. I hope you don\u2019t think this is enabling, I\u2019m trying to do what\u2019s best for my kids. \n\nI can\u2019t go on living like this though. I love him with my heart &amp; soul, but it\u2019s not healthy for my boys. My partner wants me to just be \u201ccool\u201d about his drinking &amp; accept that there is no point getting help because he\u2019s dying sooner or later anyway. That might be something I could try to do if I didn\u2019t have my children\u2019s well-being to consider. \n\nWe own a house together. I\u2019ve offered to buy him out. He won\u2019t move. I can\u2019t afford to move as all of my money is tied up in this house. My children love this house &amp; would be devastated to leave. We\u2019re all stuck here for now. \n\nI try to set boundaries &amp; ask him to not come near me or my kids when he drinks. He promises he will, but still comes &amp; says or does stupid things, encouraging my boys to not pay attention to their boring mum. He wants to be around me &amp; be affectionate, but I find him repulsive when he\u2019s been drinking. I don\u2019t drink at all anymore. After what I\u2019ve seen it do to him, I never want to see another alcoholic drink in my life. \n\nThe last time he spiralled into binging more &amp; more like is starting to happen again now, I said no more &amp; we broke up. It was horrible &amp; toxic. He refused to leave the house. He drank more &amp; more. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I tried to stay out of the house as much as possible. My boys &amp; I could have  gone somewhere else for a few days, but the problem would still be there when we got home. \n\nI was beside myself with upset &amp; worry. I was so distracted, I ended up slipping over &amp; fracturing my ankle. He came to me in the hospital that afternoon, he looked after me, he looked after my boys. I thought maybe it was the purpose he needed to keep him from drinking. He knew I was depending on him &amp; trusting him. For a short while, he was a new man with purpose and responsibility, but It didn\u2019t last. \n\nSlowly, but surely, he slipped back into old habits. He\u2019s now back to drinking every day &amp; this weekend, he\u2019s binging again. Luckily, my boys are at their dad\u2019s for the weekend. My partner always sobers up a bit for work, only drinking at night &amp; often skipping a day after a binge out of guilt, but he\u2019s getting more &amp; more out of control. This week or next week, he won\u2019t care whether my boys are around if he feels like getting totalling blasted. \n\nI know I can\u2019t cure him. I know it\u2019s not my responsibility, but how do I live my life? How do I keep my children safe from this? My boys &amp; I are stuck in this house with him. He\u2019s a wonderful man when he\u2019s sober. I don\u2019t want our relationship to end, but my kids have to come first. His drinking is spiralling further &amp; further out of control. I won\u2019t be able to shield them from it much longer. They\u2019re not old enough to understand this &amp; they shouldn\u2019t have to. ",

   "selftext": "So I quit drinking now for 7 days. So far it has almost been nothing but positive. I have so much energy its almost scary. I am hyperactive all the time, I talk and talk and talk, I walk very much! This is absolutely not a negative feeling I really enjoy it! I have been out twice now and the first time has been difficult, but the second time only the first hour or so. I have been drinking alcohol free beer to just have the natural feeling of being in a bar. Yesterday I have been drinking steadily like I would do when it was normal beer, but it was without alcohol :) and ffinally my friends dont try to talk me into drinking anymore. Something funny happened as well, my friend wanted to buy a round and came back with normal beer. I thought come on man! But then he told me I am sorry I tried to get you a non alcoholic beer but you drank their whole supply xD apparently they never really sell it.\nBut the soberness and not drinking has been in the back of my mind basically all week. The alcohol awareness has been there always. I notice now on day 7 I think less about alcohol. The cravings seem to come less and less and I realize more and more how mentally dependend I was on it and how much it took my life experiences away. That makes me also realize I am absolutely done with it. But I want to stay aware because before I know it sneaks in. It has been only a week and I know its a sneaky slippery slope that can sneak back into my mind at any point. Just one, you have it under control. It is very important for me to remember that I just don't, never have and never will.\n\nHave a nice sunday! ",

   "selftext": "First of all, today marks 4 months of freedom from alcohol and I can honestly say my life has improved in every aspect. I take excellent care of myself. I meditate and do yoga daily. I frequent this sub. I eat well and hydrate. I've been killing it professionally and personally. I've managed to save my marriage from the brink of ruin and it's getting stronger every day. I'm finally in therapy for issues of past trauma and I read about alcoholism, communication skills, and spiritual growth in my free time.  I go to AA once or twice a week. I like the meetings for the most part. It's helpful to be a part of a community of people of all walks, but all battling the same dark, insidious force of alcohol. However, now that I've been going for a couple months I'm starting to get to know some of the members and feel pressure to commit to a sponsor and work the steps and to be honest, I don't want the commitment and I'm a little turned off by the cult vibe. I haven't met anyone I've connected with enough to feel comfortable asking to be my sponsor, and even if I did, I don't want to prioritize making meetings and commiting to service positions. I have a full and rich life at the moment and I feel anxiety about the idea of trying to fit more obligations (especially social obligations which drain my introvert batteries). Finally, I don't think I would be able to fully deliver the AA message to new comers with the sincere zeal I've seen in so many members. Maybe I would if I had found AA in that window of desperation that happens in the first few weeks, but I made it out of that place using other tools. They say nobody comes to AA for the first time on a high note, but I kinda did. I love my life and I feel confident in my sobriety. I would love to have AA in my toolbox, but I don't want it to be the main component of my sobriety plan. Am I kidding myself by think I can stay sober without AA? According to countless people I've heard share in meetings,  I will eventually fall off the wagon if I don't. What do y'all think? ",

   "selftext": "Hi!\n\nSo some backstory: I quit drinking one month ago (30 days sober as of today). I would say that I was a functioning alcoholic. I mean that in the way that I wouldn't drink every day or get black out drunk. But I did drink about 4/5 days a week, mostly wine and beer, and when I drank I couldn't stop at just one glass of wine or one beer. I would also often drink alone. So I am aware that I am not one of those people who can drink occasionally a glass of wine. When I drank I always craved more. So I quit drinking a month ago, haven't had any withdrawal symptoms, but I do crave alcohol from time to time. \n Also about a month ago I met a new guy, and we have been on several dates so far, and talked about being exclusive and both wanting a serious relationship. I wouldn't say I am in love with him, but I do like him a lot and look forward to what may come out of it. The problem is I knew his mother died 3 years ago (he is 30, I am 29), but recently he told me that she died of alcoholism. She had been an alcoholic his whole life and because of it during part of his childhood he lived with his grandmother. She also had been in and out rehab, tried to quit several times, etc. the whole story. Moreover, he never met his father, so despite all this, his relationship with his mother was quite close.\nSo, since I have just met him and I didn't want to scare him away, I haven't told him yet about my problems with alcohol. Now I am even more afraid that knowing my struggle with alcoholism will scare him away, but at the same time I feel that it is unfair to keep it a secret from him, given his past. I feel like I should tell him, because I feel like, given his mother's story, we would not want to get involved with someone like me. \n\nSo my question is: what would you do if you were in my place? Would you tell him right away in case he didn't want to pursue a relationship with someone like me? or would you wait to see how things go?\n\ntldr; I quit drinking a month ago, my new boyfriend (been dating for one month) just told me his mother died of alcoholism. Have not told him yet about my struggle with alcohol. Not sure if I should tell him now or wait.",

   "selftext": "The phenomenon I call my \"social anxiety\" has ruined yet another lovely weekend. The theme being my cousins baby shower.\n\n\nThis is a super long I apologize, but I cant afford therapy so any insight would be greatly appreciated, even if you skim over the details.\n\n\nI've always dreaded big get togethers - even with family and at places I'm familiar at. I'm not shy and I don't mind being in a crowded place by myself, public speaking, or hanging out with a few friends. It's getting together with bigger groups of people *I already know* that makes me behave strange and is mentally taxing, lately becoming worse.\n\n\nNot only does it feel incredibly painful whether I go or end up flaking, but I know it affects my relationships and how people see me. \n\n\nI've never been diagnosed with anything besides garden variety depression but I know from my studies that introversion doesn't simply mean shy, it *drains energy* - whereas extroversion has the opposite effect. \n\n\nI would describe myself as seemingly outgoing and social - but after a get together I have to lock myself in a quiet area and breathe for a couple days to feel normal. I get super anxious before an \"event\" which presents itself as anger/frustration (at myself, my hair dryer, anyone around me, I become an asshole), I feel like drinking, I do weird stuff like make a big breakfast 26 minutes before I have to leave and I'm only half ready - and all of this stuff feels out of my control at the time, I only notice how stupid it is in hindsight. When I'm at the event I feel hyper or just jittery - not myself. I have to focus on not doing weird things like set my cup down unnaturally. I find it hard to listen to people even though I'm juggling conversations. I do weird socially akward things that i dread for weeks later. It feels shitty the entire time so when I finally get home I usually crash. \n\n\nI'm 26 so I know myself well enough now to describe the sensations. It seems like it's functional (yeah sure maybe I'll dread it but I'll go to my aunt's gathering for a few hours and it won't kill me), but within the past few years it's getting worse and worse.\n\n\nSo yesterday I was to drive over to my mom's house so we could drive to my grandma where my aunt would pick us up and we would all take a drive for a couple hours to the city to go to my cousins baby shower, which her friend is hosting. A lot of scheduling to meet up at the right time, a lot of close quarters, and ultimately ending up somewhere where half the people know me and the other half doesn't. I dreaded it but knew how important it was to my mom so I never thought anything of it, I was looking forward to it.\n\n\nI bought a dress to wear and was up early that morning to get ready. I take the dress out of the bag and it's wrinkly and I don't have an iron (yet). Then I realize I don't have panty hose or shoes to go with the dress. All my other clothes are dirty and smell. I start mini panicking but I keep getting ready and trying to control what I can.\n\n\nBut then I think I let it get to me and while I was rushing to do eyeliner I just slammed the (expensive) pen down into the sink and started flipping. I couldn't help but start crying and having a tantrum like a child. My boyfriend thought something serious happened. I called my mom crying and she yelled back at me that I had better get my shot together and hung up on me. I kept calling her saying I couldn't go but I was just screaming into the phone and she kept hanging up. I sat down and cried harder than I've cried in a really long time, like literally sobbing. All I could think of was how fat my legs were so I couldn't habe them exposed, and how shitty my makeup looks, and just feeling incredibly ugly and judging myself. \n\n\nMy mother still hasn't spoken to me and I fear approaching her. My boyfriend is very supportive in trying to cheer me up but honestly I felt embarrassed all day until I had a few drinks to forget about it. I still can't get certain fearful thoughts out of my head and as always I lay awake in bed thinking about them. \n\n\nI feel selfish and like an asshole. I know the event wasn't about me but my being there would mean a lot to my mom who wanted me to be there, and to my grandma who is getting older and with whom I could've spent 4 golden hours in a car just spending quality time with. I guess it meant a lot to me too. I also didn't just pretend to be sick and flaked that way, I flipped right out at people who love me and do A LOT to support me.\n\n\nI always agree to do stuff even though i know I'll fucking dread it. Days leading up to the event I try to ignore it. Then it's a gamble as to how I'll feel. My family gets together every major holiday and I've been flaking on them more and more lately. Easter was rough, I ended up flipping out then too. \n\n\nHow do I manage these really irrational behaviours? I know that no one loves big family get togethers, but we all have to go to them eventually. My family is really weird and has a big one every holiday, with birthdays and showers it adds up to a lot of anguish.\n\n\nOne more thing - my brother has been an alcoholic since he was 17 or so, so he would get beligerantly drunk at these things and it was embarrassing and heartbreaking for my mom and dad and myself. I got really scared for him and all the disappointment and energy spent on it was always exhausting. I honestly think that's what escalated my fears - on top of general self consciousllness and regular anxiety around people.\n\n\nAlthough there is a lot of logic that can be worked through I really do think my issues defy logic and the solution won't be to overcome and go to every single event. So if anyone else feels the same way I'd LOVE some support too.\n\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n\n**Tl;dr**\nI get mad anxiety over get togethers where I know people - like family. I start weird behaviours while I'm getting ready and adopt them during the event. It's completely draining. Lately it's been more like what I'd consider panic attacks - but I've never been officially diagnosed.\n\n",

I've only been dry a few days and figured I should follow the advice of a lot of people here and stock up on fizzy water of one kind or another. \n\nAt the corner store I was dumbfounded that they wanted $2.99 for 2 litres of soda water! I actually got good and pissed off and debated going somewhere else to try and save a few cents when the reality of my situation hit me like a bolt of lightning: every week I typically spend between $150 -$200 on booze without a thought. I'd spend less on food so I could afford beer and whiskey and if I couldn't afford it I'd take money from my line of credit to drink with...\n\nI kind of felt like I was two different people at the same time; drunk me and sober me were having a tug of war over that bottle of fizzy water and the insanity of my drunk way of living reeeally hit home. Fuck alcoholism!\n\nSo: I bought the soda water and later picked up a case of LaCroix and didn't go to the pub, for a change. I wonder if the bar tender missed me.

I could've left a long time ago but I've been staying for my mom and little brother: my dad is a major alcoholic with narcissistic tendencies and a need to control everyone. I dont like the idea of leaving them with him especially since I've been the one to bail the family out of tough times for the past 5 years (vodka is more important than Bills to my dad. For years he's come to me to pay rent or to put food on the table all the while being the subject of his abuse). During my freshman year in high I had to stop my dad from Cornering and beating my mom in front of my little brother and his friend while my dad was butt naked. Then its like my mom and him forgot about it. Never once was it ever talked about again --except by my once friends turned bullies who used that night against me. I stay because I didn't want that to happen again to my mom, but she's just as toxic as him now. They're both unthankful for what I've done and treat me like shit. \n\nI've had enough. I need to move out and break ties with these people. I honestly dont even fucking care what happens to them. \n\nI'm at a new job now and making decent money I think. How do I go about budgeting and getting out of this sinking ship? How do I afford to live? I also have to take on an added expenses of my moms dog. I told them they shouldn't adopt him because I was the one who would end up taking care of him and i was right from day one (guess who went out and bought the food, toys, and other supplies the night my dad adopted him to earn brownie points with my mum). I'm the one who has to take him to the vet this week because he's developing cherry eye and my mom cant be bothered to do it herself. Not to mention they never listen to me when I tell them not to let the literally retarded mini pin outside in the woods alone and just lost him 10 min ago. So yeah, he is coming with me so my parents cant ruin another living being (also, we're talking about two adults who left rat poison on the floor and killed my sisters dog 8 years ago and joke about it today) \n\nNot that it's relevant to the advice I'm asking for, I just need to vent. But they also locked my brothers chinchilla in a dark storage unit for 2 years because my dad didn't want it in the house anymore. I was the one who had to go and clean and feed him, and ultimately, after many threats but still no change, find him a new home. They Tried to stop me from taking a BCi (boa constrictor imperator) that I had taken in to the vet. I knew the snake was sick but wanted to help. They tried to stop me. I did it anyway and it ended up being too late but it was worth it. When I took in my dwarf retic and told my parents not to touch him (they were afraid of my 2' corn snake, you'd think they'd be afraid of my new 9' reticulated python whose temper was unknown) while I had to go visit my grandparents my dad sent me pictures of him holding the snake. Keep in mind the snake was still in its 2 week period of getting used to the new home. My dad paid for it later when he got bit. We also move every year because my dad's too much of a fuck up to pay rent so we get evicted, and they gave my dog away 5 years ago because the new house for that year \"did not allow pets\". Basically, they're terrible immature people who shouldn't own pets, let alone children. \n\nSorry for the rant. I'm just so fed up with fighting this fight alone. \n\n\nTL;DR: house hold is a toxic shit hole, and I need out. How do I go about it? \n\nThank you in advance. \n\nP.s. dont mind the new account.

I don't have that many years left but you do....make the most of it as there is no going back....alcohol is not your friend and if you think you have a drinking problem you do. \n\nTo quote the old saying \"If I knew I was going to live this long I would have taken better care myself\".  Just do it.....",

It will just be another day. \n\n\nI think 54 is when you can really look back on your life. \n\n\nI wanted to be a different person than I was. I gave it fucking hell too. I wasn't really exactly a man's man. I did a solid stint in the US Army. I made sergeant very quickly.  I was always a smart guy at least. It is so fucking funny.  I joined during Desert Storm in '91 and it was over before I got out of training. They sent me to Hawaii for 3 years. It was the best time of my life. I made sergeant and ended up in Kansas. I did more time in the California National Guard. 9 YEARS! 9 years I spent associated with the Army. I was done, no commitment left, no way to call me back in. I got out August 19th, 2000.  A year later all hell broke loose and it has never really stopped.\n\nI could have gone back in but fuck it, it's somebody elses turn. \n\nI ended up with a BS in computer science and I worked in my field. I did great for a while and then I got busted for like 10 bucks of coke. I haven't worked since. That was 2 years ago. \n\nListen, this isn't really what I want to write about though.  I want to talk about intentions and consequences. \n\nI wanted to be like my buddies. Fucking banging chicks, breaking their hearts, fucking people over. \n\nI did not want to be a nice guy. I wanted to be that asshole who looked at you sideways like you were an idiot. I did not accomplish this. \n\nI never became a ladies man.  I did have a lot of sex and really did get out of my comfort zone. \n\nIN the end its like so what? And you might go \"Sez the guy who didn't get laid as much as me! ahaha!\".\n\nWhat I am getting at is my intentions were bad but it just wasn't in me.  You can call me what ever the fuck you want to call me.  i will get to that in a minute.\n\n\nSo I can say, hey you know what? I really really didn't do much damage in life. I never really hurt anybody but on the other hand, I just really didn't make so much as a dent in the world. \n\n\nI am an alcoholic too. I am told by AA that I am a tornado! I have torn through and wrecked so many lives.\n\nBut here is the rub... I didn't.  I AM SURE I DISAPPOINTED THE LIVING FUCK out of people but that hardly qualifies as \"wrecked\".\n\nI say intentions and consequences but I mean intentions and results. \n\nI was not a captain of industry. I did not set the world on fire but I wanted to. \n\nCall me what you want dude. In the end, I was just a nice guy.  Maybe a little troubled but a nice guy. \n\n\nNo matter where you are in your life if we ever met , we would get along great because I am a nice guy.\n\n\nI feel really at peace. The regrets I have are like little kittens in a box in the closet rather than squirrels feasting on my balls. \n\nI would like to think things will work out but they won't.  I am going to die in the not too distant future.\n\nBut I do feel at peace for probably the first time in my life and if there is actually some reckoning when you die, I know my heart is lighter than a feather. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

So he starts drinking Thursday night and keeps it going until sunday. We are not at the stage where we are living together or I have stayed a whole lot over yet, but I know it can easily get to 10-12 cans of beer at least, thurs, fri and saturday (each day, not combined). He is super lovely when sober, but after the 6th can or so he will start repeating things he has said, forget things, and when I ask him to drop a subject or stop doing something sober he does - but if I ask him to drop a subject or stop doing something after a few drinks he will find a way to \"re-package\" the question or action and think it's clever. It's getting to the point I feel I can't really trust his word at all. \n\nI grew up with an alcoholic father who would easily get verbally abusive, and I can see a lot of the same tendencies and red flags.  But I am also scared I am \"planting\" these red flags myself since I don't have the best relationship with alcohol myself, and so I don't actually know what is normal (I don't drink at all, and my friends might take up to 3 glasses of wine on a birthday or similar occasion). Do you think he have an issue or is it something I am telling myself?\n\nAlso, I will not be able to help him if he do have an issue with alcohol, I am able to take care of myself just barely, so since it's still such a fresh relationship I will need to let it go for my own sake - but I don't know how I would break it off in that case, like \"You are drinking too much for me\" is such a bad thing to say? At least I feel that, and if he is in denial about it then it will probably seem like an absurd non-reason. \n\n(Will crosspost to r/dating) ",

   "selftext": "I'm not sure if this is allowed here and you might get depressed reading this, but let me tell my story.  It's really long. \n\nI've been addicted to dxm since 2012.  My best friend went off to college and i visited his dorm.  His roommate asked me if I wanted to trip my balls off and of course 18yo me said yes.  I only took 7 out of 16 that night but it was a night I'll never forget cuz it's the night that began my downward slide into despair.  We went on an adventure into the night and my world was rocked.  Every car that passed by felt like a rocket and when I looked at the stars I could see the definition of each crater.  We found ourselves in a queen size bed during a late night party and we were content just staring at the spackles on the ceiling.  Suddenly we were walking back to the dorm except I was a robot and I think I saw cocaine for the first time that night.  This experience caused a chain reaction leading up to today.  I started stealing one box of triple cs from a nearby store so I could relive that experience.  It would take me around 20 minutes to consume them all because I used to take them one at a time. Pick it up, drop it on my tongue, wash it down with pop.  I used to listen to music and dance in the living room when everyone was asleep cuz i felt the beat.  I would do it more often as time went on but the experience was mostly the same.   I would play games with my friends over teamspeak but they never knew what I was really doing behind the screen.  I hit rock bottom a couple times.  The first time I ever went out into daylight I was throwing some trash bags in a dumpster across the street.  When I got back inside I collapsed on the floor and in my mind I had accepted the thought that my time was up.  I would have been at peace.  Well, I was just tripping my balls off.  I used it to feel different from before and when I feel different I feel good.  The girl I was with did them with me too because she liked feeling different as well.  But she was able to stop.  This girl was an alcoholic and ended up stabbing me in the chest and arm with a knife cuz she thought I smoked all of our weed the night before.  I had been with this girl for 6 years at that point, high school sweethearts.  She cheated on me all the time, with everybody.  I am truly amazed I have no diseases from her.  I escaped to my cousin's home to flee from danger and met the woman who is now my wife and mother of my children.  I stopped using dxm for around a year because I thought I had my life together.  I had a good job at Amazon and my girlfriend was a milf who was going through a divorce. The milf was my cousin's best friend since childhood but we connected on so many levels.  When the fam found out we were together they shunned us and berated us publicly.  We had nobody but ourselves and then we found out she was pregnant.  We were kicked out from my cousin's home and I found a dude on Craigslist who let me live with him and split bills.  Still hadn't touched dxm since I learned of the pregnancy.  Well, I lost my job because my car broke down while I was on lunch and I lived too far out to carpool.  So we had to move to Michigan since we had nowhere else to go and I had friends and she had family there.  We weren't able to stay together cuz of the attitudes of the people we were staying with.  So my pregnant girlfriend was alone in the middle of winter.  Shit hit the fan and we weren't able to stay where we were so we came back home.  I got a good job at a call center right before she was born.  This is where I start fucking up.  The mental toll that childrearing takes on you is not anything you can prepare for.  As a 21yo dude I tried to keep my shit together until I couldn't.  So I asked my wife if she wanted to trip balls to take the edge off of the hardships of parenting.  I somehow managed to get my wife addicted to triple cs as well.  I became emotionally distant from my wife and child after dxm had taken it's hold on me again and we argued about everything.  I did the stupidest shit. Lied about shit I shouldn't have.  I forgot to mention that the day my wife's divorce from her ex was finalized, I proposed to her that night.  So my fiancee and I were going through tough times figuring out how to be parents again (she has 2 kids with the ex 10 yrs apart from mine) and the weight of all of it came crashing down in the form of little red pills.  Tool music videos were a nightly ritual cuz... Well have you seen a tool music video on dxm? Thank me later.  My body began craving dxm.  I craved the numbness it brought and I used more and more.  I used to only take a single box, 2 trays of 8 pills.  I knew the FAQ inside out.  I decided to see what was on the other side.  So I started upping it.  One and a half boxes at first, then two boxes a day.  That's 32 pills.  At 30mg a pop that's 960mg a day, at least.  Every day.  Then I started becoming tolerant.  I would take a box and feel as if I had not taken one at all.  My highest dose was 3.5 boxes at once.  I think.  I started losing my mind.  Every day at work I would think about the feeling.  When I got home I would pop em out and down them.  And power through the night only to get maybe an hour or two of sleep a night.  For 2.5 years I did that.  My body was powered by dxm replacing the recharge that sleep is supposed to do.  I have trouble remembering times before I used dxm, I mean shit I have trouble recalling what we were talking about 5 minutes ago.  I became able to function socially on dxm.  I was and still am able to go about my daily social life on it.  People who know me know that I'm different but it's made me a more confident, arrogant dude compared to the mentally frail dude i was in high school.  I was living the life man, chicks were diggin on me cuz I didn't give a fuck about shit, and I lost sight.  Almost got divorced cuz I was a super dumbo.  My wife tried to kill herself cuz I was emotionally distant and fucking up bad.  I lost my mind and went to jail for 4 hours.  Mom bailed me out cuz she's my mom and my wife and I stayed apart for a bit.  I was being a super shitty dad and husbo for a minute until I got my shit in check.  Then we had another baby.  Same shit happened, upped dxm to crazy shit cuz I was losing my mind.  We finally got married and settled down.  Cue accidental overdose by my wife on dxm and my family found out about my addiction.  Entire family was in shambles for a really long time because I was fucking stupid.  We're over that now and I have my head on straight in regards to my wife and kids.  I vowed never to fuck my relationship up again and I vowed to not repeat the sins of my father.  That pretty much brings us to present day where I am sitting in my couch tripping balls because I am still an addict.  My wife and kids are still with me and I will never leave them again.  The dxm is a battle I fight daily both with myself and with others to try to get a hold of what's really going on.  I am a better person on dxm but inside I am dead.  The kid I used to be died the night I took those first 7 pills with my best friend's roommate.  I have so much regrets about my life that I can't fathom them sometimes.  My kids have problems because my wife and I have problems and it's not fair for the babies to have to grow up with this shit at the beginning.  My first was premature and even though she's turning 3 next week she can't really communicate with us.  She talks sometimes but mostly she screams and is unintelligble.  My second daughter is almost 2 and doesn't speak either.  That's not to say my kids are stupid because they aren't.  Shit dudes my babies can beat the first and second worlds on super Mario Odyssey like clockwork even when my wife can't.  I don't really know what else to say.  I still use dxm not because I want to, but because I have to.  The withdrawals are so heavy that I can't make it past them.  I use it to keep the pain away now.  It used to be fun but that time is long gone.  I need help.\n\nTl;dr I got addicted to dxm and it has and still is ruining my life.",

For days it felt like every cell in my body was inflamed and that I couldn't think no matter how hard I tried. Two nights ago I couldn't stay asleep in the typical way that happens after I binge. I did things more poorly the whole time, all for a few hours of forgetting about the world and shirking responsibility.\n\nI am a chronic relapser, and I don't want to ever drink again and consider myself an addict/alcoholic.

It's that when I relapse, it doesn't FEEL like a choice, but in a sense, I know that it is. My body goes into autopilot, or at least the cravings and denial are such a habit and/or so subconscious I yield to them. I guess that's what it's like being an alcoholic. One day at a time.",

Like I had a really big phase last year and my friends and I all saw the problem but after about 3 months of this I managed to stop and just have 2 drinks for a long time just at outings, and sometimes getting drunk with friends but pretty rarely. \n\nI now feel like sometimes I\u2019m in real control and others I have one and I just need more and more and more.

I know I definitely need a break, I\u2019m going to try and go 30 days but it seems SO daunting. \nI\u2019m also sooo ashamed of this but I have a real problem with driving too... I know.

I was drinking in secret, and there was never liquor visible in the house. I hid it in my man cave garage. Initially I could outsmart them and just stagger around and slur inappropriate comments.

   "selftext": "Hey everyone, I\u2019ve been lurking here awhile but just tonight finally felt ready to post. It\u2019s been helpful reading everyone\u2019s posts and comments, so thanks. \n\nI\u2019m struggling a bit tonight because as of yesterday my boyfriend (32 M) and I (31 F) are on a break. We live together so I\u2019m not sure how things will work over the next few weeks. Basically he is an alcoholic- not a violent or abusive one, but it\u2019s clearly going downhill and has very much damaged us. I was in denial about it for much of our relationship (been together about a year and five months now). I don\u2019t have prior close experience with any alcoholics so I think that\u2019s why it took me quite awhile to really figure out the level of the problem and I feel somewhat stupid and ashamed for not realizing sooner/enabling him. When we got together he told me he had been to rehab previously and had been sober for four years, but it was ok for him to only drink beer and wine now instead of liquor. I was slightly concerned but took him at his word. About the first nine months or so of our relationship things were mostly fine with just a few strange incidents. A couple of times he\u2019d be \u201csuddenly drunk\u201d or exhibit sneaky behavior to drink or get high (pot) when he wouldn\u2019t have needed to sneak at all as I\u2019m not opposed to either depending on the circumstances. \n\nAnother big warning sign which I didn\u2019t understand initially is that he was keeping his renewed drinking secret from his family and gradually made me complicit in hiding the secret also. They know he went to rehab and his dad is a big alcoholic too so there are a lot of tricky family dynamics at play. He initially told me he just didn\u2019t want them to worry about him, and by the time I got wise, going behind his back to tell them would have been viewed as a huge breach of trust. \n\nIn September of last year he took on a stressful new job and things began to get a lot worse. He began drinking as soon as he got home from work every day. Maybe not what some would consider an excessive amount (he would fairly rapidly down two large beer cans) but I noticed a big effect on his mood. He would be irritable, depressed, lethargic, morose, anxious. He also started lying to me here and there about his pot and alcohol use. In December I confronted him about this and he denied it to my face, but I still didn\u2019t fully understand that he was an addict so I again gave him the benefit of the doubt. However, I was concerned enough that I began to try to document the amount of drinks he was consuming (at least the ones I knew about).\n\nOn New Years Eve he got completely wasted at a chill friend hang out by sneaking off to the kitchen to drink. There was no reason to sneak as he could have been drinking in front of people in the living room. I was furious and embarrassed. Once I got him home and in bed I heard him vomiting and ran in to help him. He was uncoordinated and failing to open a window (he puked some on the drapes and floor). I cleaned things up and had a serious talk with him the next day. Unprompted, he said he would stop drinking. I was hugely hopeful and around this time decided to go ahead with moving in with him (which turned out to be a very dumb move on my part). \n\nThe sobriety lasted a month and then he went back to after work drinking. In this phase he started going out after work with buddies in an effort to not let me know as much I guess. He also started to give me a lot more flack and push back if I questioned him about it. There were quite a few fights and I said I would be ok with him drinking as long as he would tell me up front and be honest about things. I was trying to control things which I now know can make it worse. \n\nTowards the end of March I again caught him sneakily getting high when I thought we were just having a nice evening at home together. It was so frustrating because if he had mentioned he wanted to do it, I wouldn\u2019t have even told him no! I fully realized then how illogical and compulsive his behavior was. We had a huge fight and I left to stay with a friend for a few nights. He was upset and cold with me when i came back and still denied he had been sneaking around. \n\nBasically since then things have mostly kept declining with a few good days here and there. He did start going to Smart meetings, and I started going to Al anon. But he was extremely resistant to actually stopping drinking and still claimed he could moderate. He has been more and more irritated, mean, and difficult with me and has continued to lie to me. He had set \u201cgoals\u201d for himself and told them to me (ie. to only drink two days a week). But then has still gone out to drink almost every day after work with colleagues. I basically feel like he was just paying me lip service to try to keep me from getting upset. \n\nHe had told me last weekend that he was open to talking about rehab, couples counseling, and therapy for himself and that he wouldn\u2019t drink for the next two weeks as he had an extremely complicated and busy time at work ahead. He held out for a couple of days but was exceptionally grumpy with me. I tried to give him space so I went out to events on Thursday and Friday nights. When I came home Friday he was passed out reeking of alcohol and I heard him coughing and choking on fluid in his sleep. I kept trying to prop his head up but he was really incoherent and barely responsive. I was legitimately worried that he could choke and die.\n\nThe next morning he was chipper like nothing had happened. But I had had enough. I was super upset but I said we needed a break and he agreed. It hurts so much bc I think he has more and more been blaming me for the relationship problems and even for his drinking. He is very high functioning at work so I felt like I was the only one addressing what a problem it was. He did text later that day and say he was trying to schedule rehab but I still don\u2019t know if he\u2019s sincere. \n\nNow i have to figure out how to navigate this break and if I am willing to stick with him if he does go through with rehab. I think he at least now knows that I\u2019m only willing to be with him if he\u2019s sober. I also realized today that with the medication he is on (clonazepam for anxiety) he really shouldn\u2019t be drinking AT ALL as it could lead to an overdose or him stopping breathing. This also explains a bit why he would get so sloppy and uncoordinated after having even a small amount to drink. I\u2019m feeling anxious, heartbroken, unsure of my future, and very concerned about him. We do still love each other. Thanks for your support. \n\nTLDR: my boyfriend went to rehab once before, and was sober for four years. He was drinking moderately-ish when we got together but has been spiraling down even though he is still high functioning. He has gotten very sneaky and been lying to me. We are now on a break but I\u2019m very worried about him bc of his medication and also bc his dad is an lifelong active alcoholic too and I\u2019m really sad he\u2019s on that path.",

   "selftext": "I began drinking alcohol at an early age of 14, but the first drink I remember having was a cup of beer my father gave me when I was 5 years old. In High School I started binge drinking with friends. My friends would steal it and their parents would buy it for us. I was drinking then because it was \u201cfun\u201d but what I did not know was this was the start of a horrible addiction I would live with for the rest of my life. \n\tI joined the Marine Corps right out of High School at 18 years old and within four months of being in I had older Marines buying me alcohol and we would drink together in the barracks. I was stationed in Virginia at the time and there was a strict zero tolerance policy at my unit for drinking underage. One day I met a guy in the Navy who had a moonshine connection and I started getting it from him. It wasn\u2019t long until someone snitched, and I was NJP\u2019d for it. I lost my rank, had half pay for 2 months, and was put on 2 months of restriction. Despite this punishment, I continued to drink in secret and just got better at hiding it from people. \nAfter Virginia, I came to 29 Palms, CA for my permanent duty station in 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines. Soon after checking into the unit, I found out we were deploying to Afghanistan in a few short months. I quickly found a group of friends and began binge drinking more than I ever had. The rules were a lot less strict than in Virginia and it was easy to get away with. While I was on deployment, we were given beer for the Marine Corps Birthday which I thought was ironic because they enforce zero tolerance on underage drinking, yet they were giving it to underage Marines knowingly. \n\tAfter I returned from Afghanistan, I started partying harder than ever. I was intoxicated more than I was sober, and I got a fake ID and began going out to clubs and bars. I eventually began doing other drugs like cocaine and LSD. They were very easy to get out in 29 Palms and my friends and I were using them often. I became dependent, primarily on alcohol and couldn\u2019t go a day without it. I had a problem but refused to believe that I was an alcoholic. After all, my good friends were doing the same thing.\n\tDeployment number 2 rolled around in early 2015 and this time I was headed to Kuwait. With nothing to do in Kuwait, I started buying bottles of Nyquil and other medications and abused them. I also had a friend of mine send me liquor in the mail as alcohol was banned in Kuwait. I remember another friend had his wisdom teeth pulled and was prescribed oxycodone. We drank and snorted those pills and at the same time would inhale cans of aerosol to get q quick high. My life wasn\u2019t going in the direction I had thought it would at all. In fact, I was really depressed, and I was using these drugs to cope.\n\tIt only got worse when I got back from my second deployment. The first weekend back I went to Knotfest, a 2-day concert, and did tons of ecstasy and cocaine at the show. As the months went by, the addictions worsened and so did my depression. Eventually, it started affecting my relationships. I became very turned off from the world and drank to pass out every night. When I found out 3/7 was going to deploy me again I slumped, and then my ex cheated on me and that was the last straw. I was out of control, getting jumped at bars and even got arrested a couple times. I was so depressed and convinced my life was over and there was nothing good for me. One day I got the courage to go into mental health and talk about my depression and anxieties. I was referred to the alcohol abuse rehab and began doing Outpatient Rehab classes.\nEven though I began going to AA and the alcohol rehab classes, I was still very depressed and struggling with my sobriety. Eventually my 5-year contract with the Marines was done so I was a free man. After getting out of the Marines I was significantly happier and stopped taking my antidepressants. My mood was better, but my habits had not changed. I was still drinking in excess, and driving while intoxicated, however, I quit doing the hard drugs. I got rolled up again in October of 2017 this time for a DUI and have been sober ever since. Once I had hit rock bottom my mindset changed. I didn\u2019t want anything to do with alcohol or drugs. From the $20,000 in court and lawyer fines and fees, injuries and health problems I\u2019ve faced, and depression and anxiety alcohol has caused me I\u2019m done with it for good. I am now 7 months sober and happier than ever, and I plan to stay sober for good. \n",

   "selftext": "I'll start this by saying I definitely fall into the category of emotional and mental disorders and alcohol was definitely used in self medication on top of being an alcoholic. Even before drinking, so childhood and teen years, I've dealt with undiagnosed anxiety and depression and possibly a sleep disorder. I know that's what's wrong because I just know without getting into specifics, a few addictions counselors from more than one point in my life reccomended that I look into actually seeing a psychiatrist to look into some of my other issues because they thought there could be more going on than just addictive behaviors. My mom was too poor and to religious to be able to afford to send me to a psychiatrist. Then at 19 I joined the Marine Corps and didn't want to get kicked out for mental health issues. So I self medicated with booze until eventually having to get alcohol counseling over some crazy shit I did while drunk on top of being put into a psych ward briefly. \n\nSo here it goes. I haven't smoked weed in years and while I was using it for self medication purposes I would have traded what weed would have done to me for what alcohol did to me anyday. \nI never liked getting super high, and while I did get in trouble for it in high school, I wasn't using it everyday and I would just be able to relax on it when I would get these massive anxiety attacks or shitty depression spells, no real issues aside from the fact that it was an illegal substance and a bit of memory loss. Now, Weed and AA's stance on it is one of the things that actually concerns me about my sobriety from alcohol, which I just started again 40 days ago. I definitely used alcohol because I'm an alcoholic. But I was also using alcohol to self medicate my other issues. I know I should probably see a psychiatrist However if I actually see a psychiatrist, like I probably should, they're probably going to want to put me on medications that have some really bad side effects and cost quite a bit of money and come with their own form of dependency as well that really isn't talked about enough or possibly weed. I think weed might actually be good for me from a medical standpoint. When I was younger and I smoked it was one of the few ways I could relax from my anxiety attacks or my depression spells, I didn't really like being really high, but just a bit for those issues. Granted weed isn't the greatest thing either and it does have its problems that come with it, but at the same time I just feel like I would have a better chance at staying away from alcohol with it than just doing the 12 steps, mainly because of how I used alcohol to self medicate a lot of my own issues with my mental health on top of being an alcoholic, but at the same time I would just be shunned from AA which is helping me to stay sober and probably the only way I won't destroy my life with alcohol, but weed might be the only way I don't lose my mind and relapse into alcohol anyway. Damned if I do damned if I don't. Anyways that's ok my mind right now.\n\nI should also say that neither of those two really led to each other. I used marijuana for a bit before I had my first drink, my first drink was not with weed, I only drank on weed once and it was the worst feeling in my life, when I was smoking weed for the second short lived period of time I wasn't drinking which was after my first experiences abusing alcohol and getting drunk.",

Today is the worst it has been in awhile. I\u2019m also obsessed and paranoid by all the variables of what could go wrong. The problem is, when I\u2019m more calmly depressed, I have all these plans to write letters to specific people and very carefully and methodically pick one of my chosen methods. But then days like today occur, where I want to do it as soon as I can, tomorrow morning, and I\u2019m way to desperate to take the time to write out letters(let alone the additional hurt it would inevitably bring writing the letters) or make sure my method is fool proof. My worst fear it to be found before I die and as a consequence left in a mentally reduced state. Also, my dog is my life. I don\u2019t trust anyone I know to take care of him like I would. I can\u2019t imagine killing my dog, but me and my dog have a bond that invoked separation anxiety in both of us. He sits by himself in my grandmas basement waiting for me to come home. Like there is no way I could leave my dog either...I\u2019m in a horrible position. I can\u2019t stand existing right now despite how much I love my dad and dog. But my life is so full of pain otherwise, I feel so irreparably damaged in various ways. Emotionally, socially, sexually. To the point where no life worth living seems attainable. And it keeps getting worse. I\u2019m going to be clean for 2 years come July and I have never been more distraught in every sense. I have no social life. At all. When I got clean, my life essentially ended. I was told everything would get better, as I was at rock bottom. Somehow, this is worse. At least in my addiction I have a wild variation of good and bad days. Now they are just all bad days, living in my bedroom, spending everyday looking out my fucking window. A 26 year old woman who wants nothing more than love and a life, but it just seems so far gone now. But I can\u2019t even bring myself to do anything from the overwhelming sick feeling I get when my thoughts venture into the inevitable moment my dad finds out. Him and my dog are all I have left in my life, my mum died when I was teenager, but she was an alcoholic lost in addiction for my entire life until one year before her death. She finally got clean, only one year into sobriety she was diagnosed wit terminal lung cancer. The mother I had always desperately wanted was finally here, but I only had her for a year at 16. I needed her so bad especially in these last years. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m writing this. ",

   "selftext": "English is not my main language, so sry for my mistakes. I'm a 22 year old guy, I relapsed after 19 days and I don't beat myself up for it. This is my experience of nofap and the reason I want my PMO. I am not speaking for every fapstronauts. I am not saying that stopping PMO is bad, you should get rid of this habit. I will give you my solution to get rid of the habit.\n\nI didn't get the superpowers nofappers mentioned. I just feel very depressed during the journey. I also added no internet, no smartphone and no games during the journey. \n\nI do get 1 IMPORTANT benefit from this. I become more aware. I am aware that I have lots of emotional problems. I remember how angry, lonely, unhappy, bored, insecure, anxious, lazy I am in life. I remember how much I hated my schizophrenic mother and alcoholic dad and feeling sad and sorry for them at the same time. I remember why I hate girls and people in general, because of my own short coming. I am more aware about how I feel and think.\n\nAnd I hate to think and feel about my issues. I hate my mind and thoughts. This is where my habits come from.\n\nLots of people will add addiction into their life, if they are feeling horrible like me. And it is okay to be addicted, don't hate yourself for it. And be happy that you are coping with PMO/games/internet or other behavioural addiction instead of substance (which is more destructive for your body).\n\nNow, the reason why I don't want to quit PMO yet. PMO and my other habits is saving me. PMO keeps me sane. PMO can help me overcome my problems. It gives me the energy I needed to keep fighting. It helps me to fall asleep, It prevents me from using benzodiazepine. It helps me destress.\n\nI am simply not ready for nofap. It is impossible to stop if you are not happy with your life yet. Have you ever seen a happy addict? Nope. And there's a reason why having supports helps you overcome addiction. It just makes you happier if you have loneliness issues and need to be understood. \n\nIf the reason why you fap is because you desperately want love from a girl. Then you will notice that your fap habit will decrease and eventually vanish if you have found the right girlfriend.\n\nYou should fix the root of your problems first, instead of addiction. Use your addiction as an energy boost. And you also need to have control over your mind and life, this way you won't waste too much time on PMO/games/internet. But you get just the right amount of energy to fix the root of your problems.\n\nDuring your journey, you should add other healthy habits too, that will eventually diminish and replace your PMO habit. My plan is to workout daily and eat healthy, because it will tackle MOST of my problems. It doesn't fix it, but it makes me happier in the long run.\n\nWorkout will fix your laziness and you will get some kind of chain reaction effect, where you begin to fix other aspect of your life aswell. But how can you do it, when you are too lazy to do it? It's different for everyone. What works well for me is to have a support that gives me a punishment for skipping gym. I asked a friend to punish me, I told her that I will give her 50 bucks if I skip a day. Fear motivates me a lot, that's why it works. You may also reward yourself after your workout. The simple reward and punishment system works very well imo. You just need to find a way that works for you. It will become a habit after a while and you don't need rewards and punishment anymore.\n\nI hope my post inspire you in a way. Relapsing may feel like a failure, but it doesn't mean that you are giving up on yourself. Sometimes you can't handle life anymore and need a reward for fighting so hard. It's okay to give up on nofap for a while. You will create another strategy, have a new mindset and will eventually make it.\n\nMy advice is to get your priority straight. There's a bigger and scarier problem than PMO in your life. Focus on that problem and ignore the other problems for now. You are not strong enough YET to deal with them all in 1 go. \n\nAnd if nofap makes you happy, keep doing it. Doesn't matter if you think it is a placebo or something else, if it works, it works. But please be aware that other factors can also affect your happiness. Your energy and passion may come from yourself and you should compliment yourself for being awesome, instead of thinking that you are worthless if you don't save your semen.",

McCormick vodka to be exact. Yeah the good stuff. /s\n\nIn January, things really started going south. I was getting blackout drunk regularly. I had started getting violent with my boyfriend in the months prior. End of January, boyfriend comes home and I\u2019m passed out. The next thing I know,  I am grabbing him by the hair and trying to wrestle him into the bathtub. He was able to restrain me after a pretty long struggle. Long story short, things got quite ugly. He went to jail. I didn\u2019t. But I should have as well. I later found out that I had punched him in the face multiple times. His mugshot shows his face is all bruised and bloody. It was a low time for us. \n\nHe\u2019s since quit drinking with no issues. I continued to hide my drinking. I\u2019d go to work drunk and get sent home. Many times. I no call/no showed a total of 15 times this year alone and they still let me stay. It was the best job I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019d found my tribe. They knew I have a problem. One month ago, after a day and night of drinking a couple pints of vodka, I went in and told my boss that I had to quit. Right then and there. It was a stupid impulsive thing. But I just couldn\u2019t do my job anymore because I was always drunk. In my drunken stupor, I had decided that I was going to move an hour away to a relatives house in the country and get my head on straight. \n\nYou know what I did instead? I went on a bender. I had some \u201clighter\u201d drinking days here and there. But I\u2019ve been mostly drunk or passed out since the beginning of April. The past 2 weeks I\u2019ve been in the darkest place I\u2019ve ever been. I quit showering. Eating. I couldn\u2019t leave the house. Just sat on my couch drinking my vodka and shoving the empty bottles under the couch, walking to the store to get more. Repeat. Repeat. \n\nI called my ex husband to take me to the ER to detox. I blew a .27 and begged them to help me. They sent me home. A few days later, I went to the rehab down the road. THEY sent me home! I spent a few more days on my couch. I called the suicide hotline. I called around in circles to different treatment places. No one could help me. \n\nLuckily I have an Rx for Valium. So I packed up and went to stay with my mom for a few days. I couldn\u2019t stand to be alone. I knew I would continue drinking. I knew something bad was going to happen. I spent 3 days there and should have stayed longer but I just wanted to be home. To go to meetings (mom lives in the sticks, no close meetings). I was already going to them before, unfortunately while drunk still. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this is all over the place. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve said anything inappropriate. I am just so anxious. I\u2019ve hardly slept. I\u2019m excited to actually do this and work the steps. I\u2019m terrified to actually BE with myself. I\u2019ve always been a very anxious person AND I have horrible tinnitus, both of these things I have masked with alcohol for years. And now I have to deal with it. And it\u2019s driving me crazy. It\u2019s so tempting to just go buy a bottle but then it\u2019ll just put me back at square 1. Every little pain or weird thing my body does I\u2019m going \u201coh no I\u2019m dying\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s no real point to this post. I\u2019m sure I can go on and on and on. I\u2019m just happy that I finally got the gut to post, to show up to some meetings, to actually open up and read some chapters in the Big Book, and to reach out to strangers who have been where I am for support. I know AA isn\u2019t for everyone, but it\u2019s the route I\u2019m taking. I feel like I\u2019ve just gotten on a roller coaster that\u2019s starting to climb the first hill so there\u2019s no way to change my mind and get off.  Here we go. \n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far thank you. I absolutely will not drink with you today. \n",

I have given myself 2 days to get past the initial anger and this is the right thing. Still HARD though!!  We have been together 2 years and no one makes me laugh like him.  I love him. We  always have the best time playing together (games, political discussions, camping). My sobriety has lessened this, for sure, but not entirely - I still enjoy his company. He is a \"happy drunk.\" However, no intimacy for over 8mo. His drinking is responsible for only 80% of that. I think he is just asexual and I gave up trying. So, we have been buddies for a long time anyway...why is it so hard to put the period on it? In my sobriety, I have noticed this about our relationship: we rarely go anywhere  so he can continue drinking, I have to be the dd any time we do, I can never go over to his house after 6:30pm and expect coherent conversation, seeing him with a glass of scotch at 8am (Saturday) doesn't shock me at all, he may be hard of hearing, but DAMN! drunk people are annoying as hell to talk too. He has never lied to me about who he is. He told me right off that he was set in his ways and was \"unlikely to change.\" I chose to go all in and increase my drinking to match his. I chose to stay all these months in the hopes that I could change his mind and we would marry. I am so glad I didn't and we did not. I wonder if he were to get sober, would that make everything ok? Is it really just the alcohol that is the problem? I have no idea, because I really have no idea who is is without it. I have been a widow for 5.5 yrs and had enjoyed a 22 yr relationship with my husband. Rarely ever drank during those years. I feel like, I am coming back into that person. The desperate desire to be married again has faded with my sobriety. My visions of future family gatherings no longer require me being married. Oh, I will date. Don't get me wrong! Just not feeling like marriage is necessary anymore. Closing on a new (to me) house today, the first I have ever owned by myself, as a proof! Wish me luck and strength to accept the things I cannot change and to let them go.\n\n  ",

The things that schocked me extremely were my dreams. Frightening, dark dreams in which i ran from something.

I found out that alcohol can cause psychadelic experiences when hungover and dehydrated. \n\nI want to reduce my alcohol consumption but I think partying without alcohol is kinda boring. My assumption is that I will stop drinking alcohol when I stop partying, has anyone experiences where they thought the same thing, but didn't stop?

Not even close my typical 1.5L bottle per night that I was dosing up until I was taken to the hospital by the police.  Then, late last week, my new psychiatrist took me off of one med I was taking at a super high dose and put me on a low dose of Seroquel (because, as she and I both know, starting at a therapeutic dose of Seroquel from the get-go means sleeping 18-20+ hours a day for months).  Two days after that change, my panic attacks came back and are worse than they've been in a couple of years.  I'm throwing up from them again, afraid to leave my apartment, afraid to leave my bed...  I'm even having them in my sleep again.\n\nToday I ended up buying a bottle of wine that is usually $12-15 per 1.5L bottle but was on sale for $6.99.  I couldn't resist when I saw the sale.  I intentionally got a low-alcohol containing variety because my tolerance is lower and I don't want to do something exponentially more stupid.\n\nI'm not drunk now.  I just got back from the store and poured myself a glass, but I've been staring at it the whole time after taking a sip.  I'm disappointing myself, my fiance, and my family, and they don't even know it yet.  This is the best sobriety streak I've had in years...\n\nYou all know the struggle.  Talk some sense into me.  I know the panic attacks will subside in a few days (the med change coincided with my period--two of the strongest triggers at once), I've lost 40lbs and don't need to drink empty calories...  But I'm so afraid to go out right now, and with my med changes, I'm on *nothing* for anxiety for the first time in almost ten years.  I've only had two therapy sessions.  I don't know how to cope.\n\nThanks...  &lt;3\n\nA Noteworthy Edit:\n\nI was put on Naltrexone at the first hospital I was at during my two-month inpatient stays.  It definitely helped with the cravings.  They said it would make it difficult for me to feel the alcohol's intoxication as well, although, since I was in the hospital, I never experienced that.  Should I ask for that again?  My therapist works at the same place as my psychiatrist and I have an appointment there on Friday morning.",

CONGRATS!!!! We love you and we welcome you to a new life of, well, whatever you want to make of it :)\n2. Over the next few months, you're going to start facing a lot of fears that you a. didn't even know were fears (because alcohol puts a nice comfy veil over things), and b. that you didn't want to face yet\n3. Anxiety stems from fear of something, your job is to find the root of whatever that fear is. It usually barrows down to FEAR OF &gt; being judged, making mistakes, being rejected, being alone, not being in control, and dying --- if you can \"rationalize\" those fears (IE we're all gonna die some day) then you'll be ahead of the game and it should calm you down a bit\n4. You're gonna get to know your true self, embrace it! You may be a little quirky, shy, an actual asshole, eccentric, etc, take the good qualities and leave the rest (if you want to!)\n5. You're gonna feel alone, like no one you know understands what you're going through -- feels like you're 15 again, right? Welp-- that's because the people you know you probably made connections with through drinking! There may be a lot of clarity involved that your group of friends might be a tad bit toxic, not that it's a terrible thing, but it's probably not conducive to recovery now. Taking a break from your group of friends right now until you feel comfortable saying no to a drink may be the best thing. You don't have to end the relationships forever, just consider it a Ross and Rachel break. Hit up some recovery meetings (AA is the largest) and I'm not promoting this for the stepwork, but for the fellowship and to not feel alone! www.intherooms.com is a good online alternative, as is this subreddit. Face-to-face is really important.\n6. You might need to be validated. You're going to probably feel a bit lost for a while, and the reason might be because your brain is trying to get you to drink. I chalk this up to like a bad acid trip. Your brain is going to wander and dig up some terribly evil shit because addiction is a wild ass disease. You may need to get grounded and remember that you are loved and you are needed here, there are people waiting for you to come through the other side so you can help the lost souls that come in after you. (So please, stay with us!)\n7. We are an army of good and loving and kind people, we had to walk through the depths of hell to come out the other side. We hold each others hand because no one can do this alone. Never be afraid to ask for help, we will be there for you. The only thing we want, is for you to pay this forward.\n8. \"Doubt looks down, worry looks around, hope looks up.\"\n\nHappy Monday to you all, IWNDWYT &lt;3\n",

I grab nothing, since I plan to just drink a few out of the giant case BF is getting. \n\nAfter BF checks out with this smug, old man clerk who's chewing on a toothpick, we start to walk out together and old dude looks at me and asks if I'm pregnant. \n\nBeing truthful, I'm not thin. I could be mistaken for being pregnant. But who says that?! This is not the first time an old man asked me that, either. The truth is, I'm actually infertile, I suffer from endometriosis, and both of those things hurt me deeply. \n\nI also understand that perhaps he's an alcoholic who drinks an 18 pack in a night and thought that whole case was for BF and I wasn't drinking. And assumed that the only reason I wouldn't be drinking too is that I was pregnant. \n\nStill... It's a horrible thing to ask someone considering that 1) it's none of this stranger's  business what's going on with my body, pregnant or not, and 2) him asking me was hurtful in several ways. No one should be so stupid as to not realize that in being wrong, you just called a woman you don't know fat in a public place. \n\nI didn't let it ruin my day like it has before, but I wish I'd had the guts to tell him what I thought of that question when I had the chance instead of just looking at him funny and leaving.

She was witness to my descent into the bottle, though I hid it pretty well from her up until my last night of drinking. Well, at least I *think* I hid some of it. \n\nOn that night (my last night of drinking), I was in a world of hurt. I had already called it and said that was my last night. I was pissed about it. I was yellow with jaundice. I couldn't keep food down. But I could drink. I cried to her while our husbands were with the kids at the park. \"*Something isn't right*!\" I told her about my stomach pain, my all-consuming sadness, that I couldn't eat and I felt like I was going insane. I poured another shot of bottom shelf vodka. \n\nWhen I was hospitalized later that week she kept my son for a couple nights.\n\nI say all of that because in this morning's text she told me she's going to stop drinking for 30 days, possibly more. She says \"one of my motivations is definitely driven by you and your change.\" \n\nAnd then I cried cuz that is just about the sweetest text message I have ever gotten. I'm so happy she's taking this step... I hope it's a positive experience for her. I told her \"I won't drink with you!\" and about SD and how it's helped me. It feels awesome to be a good influence on someone! Who knew?! \n\nAfter I told her about SD I realized I haven't really been checking in much. We moved and I've just been so happy and busy. I've thought about stopping in and decided I didn't need to... but then I get this text. It was a reminder of how far I have come. And if I fuck it up and get too cocky I could land my ass right back there again. \n\nSo, I'm checking in. Life is really **really** good for me these days. I can't even believe we living here... we've been in our new house one month! Exactly none of this would be possible if I was still looking for answers in the bottom of bottles. I am not cured. \n\nI will not drink with you today. ",

Every day is just becoming more of a struggle. I'm 23 years old and I've been working towards my two-year degree for five years. I thought this would be the year I could kick myself into gear, but as per usual I dropped my class because I couldn't keep up with the stress of it. I was only taking one class, but it was a full class in half a semester (half-semester courses are the only thing my community college offers). I want to transfer to an art school, but the costs are really overwhelming me and the idea of being in that much debt is really scary. I've tried talking to my parents about it, but their advice that I should pray more (lol) or that I'm not actually trying/I don't have what it takes to be an illustrator. The very idea of that is a nightmare to me, because it's something I've always been passionate about and cannot see a life before me that doesn't involve that. \n\nHell, my parents are major stressors in my life, but I can't afford to move out since I am constantly paying for school, have no car, and work a shitty job that doesn't pay me enough to live anywhere that's near this town. My dad just doesn't understand anything about me. I barely talk to my parents, I've been emotionally distant from almost every single family member since early high school, in which I've gone days or weeks without talking to/seeing them. When I do, it's usually them asking me how my day was only to stonewall them and say \"good I guess\" and then go to my room. But my dad in particular is constantly berating me about everything. I don't think I've had a conversation where he hasn't had something to shit on me about. There were days during summer where I would starve myself because I would not go downstairs to the kitchen because my dad was there. He used to be an alcoholic, and would take physical actions sometimes, but I feel like I'm rambling enough already. I just can't shake the feeling they don't support me at all, and the thought is just heartbreaking. My little sister has been apathetic to me, but I assume that's because I'm practically an absent family member, and I can't helps but feel incredibly guilty. \n\nI have some friends, but I'm incredibly socially awkward/anxious so outside of that I find it difficult to even speak to someone, so I have no friends at work and just do my job for 40+ hours before going home and avoiding my family members. \n\nI feel like I've been a deer in the headlights for the past five years. I've been struggling with suicide ideation every day for the past few months, and even tried to act upon it. I'm just scared, lost, confused...? I don't know what to do so I thought I'd turn to Reddit to find a helpful community to feel a part of. Sorry for going tl;dr, but I feel like I just needed to get all this off my chest, and I'd be grateful for any kind of advice. Thank you so much for listening.",

I honestly don't remember when I last laughed as much as this weekend - and it turns out I like myself better sober (or maybe I just dislike myself pissed, but am always too pissed to remember). \nMy husband woke up this afternoon (he lost the morning to his hangover) and asked me if he'd ruined my night and ruined the weekend because he couldn't remember what he'd said or done.

   "selftext": "It's been almost a year, \\(well, eleven months\\) since I said, \"I can't take this anymore\" and sought out al\\-Anon and this online group.  I wanted to thank you guys \\(and the folks in local al\\-Anon\\) for helping me through that difficult time.  \n\nThe capsule version of my story is basically this:  My fiancee was my qualifier.  She had a problem with alcohol that crept up slowly and affected our relationship, pulling me near to my breaking point last summer.  I started talking to friends and family about the issue in early 2017, and I started seeking help \\(the program and here online\\) in late June/early July.  Things were pretty rough.  I spent most of last summer offering my qualifier one last chance at getting on the path to sobriety \\-\\- whether it was through meetings, detox, rehab, whatever.  \n\nThat summer she made what were, in retrospect, half\\-hearted efforts to get away from the bottle, mainly because she thought if she did just enough, she would satisfy me.  I figured out she was making half\\-hearted efforts, and then I called off our marriage six days before the wedding day. \n\nOnce away from me, she was able to freely indulge in alcohol, and then it finally dawned on her she had a problem when she realized she had physical addiction.  About three or four months after our split, I drove her to rehab and wished her luck.  \n\nLooking back, she drank partly because she and I were never reached accord on some of the issues in our relationship, and she couldn't really directly face them. She said the alcohol helped her numb the pain.  I wonder why, if she was that unhappy, she couldn't just break up with me rather than turn to the bottle.  \n\nI've been going to therapy myself both to get past the breakup and to figure things out.  My qualifier completely owns her drinking.  But I have to own some of the other issues our relationship had, for better or for worse, and I have to figure out what about myself needs to change \\-\\- and ensure I never end up in that kind of codependent relationship again.  I think she's having some issues living on her own, but they are her issues, not mine.  She blames me for most of what went wrong in our relationship and thinks I should not have ended things.  She's entitled to her opinion.  But I don't have to listen to it.  \n\nAnd at this point, it's her life.  My qualifier and I are no longer on speaking terms.  While I can't say I'm the happiest I have ever been, I am nevertheless happier than I have been in a long time.  \n\nIf I'm honest, I haven't been to an Alanon meeting in about seven months.  And I'm not sure the entire program is for me.  But, **I would not be where I am today \\-\\- happier and healthier \\-\\- if I had not reached out to al\\-Anon in the first place.**  The other people in my local Al\\-Anon meetings and I shared a similar approach.  For the most part, we were professionals of one sort or the other \\-\\- medical professionals, finance professionals, legal professionals \\-\\- who earned our money by fixing other people's problems.  And those who weren't were always the steady, reliable rocks in their family \\-\\- the one everyone depended on.  I think all of us had encountered frustration and unhappiness because we couldn't fix our qualifiers' substance abuse the way we fixed everything else.   **Al\\-Anon was vital to unlearning that \"fixing\" wouldn't work** \\-\\- that some problems in life can't be cajoled, argued, or counseled into quiescence.  And most importantly, I learne**d that even if I couldn't \"fix\" my qualifier, I could \"fix\" myself and my sit**uation.  Which I did.  And talking to other members gave me the strength to end things with my qualifier, even knowing that in many tellings, I would be the villain of the story.  \n\nI guess I'm posting here for a couple reasons.  Partly gratitude \\-\\- for helping me through a difficult point in my life.  But also because I want people with alcoholic SOs \\-\\- a boyfriend or girlfriend, a fiance or fiancee, a husband or a wife \\-\\- to know the world will not end if you part ways with your qualifier.  You may feel like shit for a while.  It's not going to be easy.  But there is another side of this mountain.  After difficulty, you can find yourself in a better place.  Maybe not a place of complete happiness.  But a place where you are better off than you were and, most importantly, if you set your boundaries, you can find yourself again.  ",

At the end I still felt the need to use, but after attempting to kill myself with aforementioned heroin (and some xanax along for the party) I had a pretty good reason not to go back. Add that to the fact that I deleted everyone's number that was associated with it. Now, maybe 7-8 years later I tell doctors up front to never prescribe me narcotic painkillers (kratom is a good substitute!) and I fantasize about heroin maybe once every year or so.\n\nWith drinking its a different game. After the first 72 hours it seems my physical side effects are gone, but there's so much more surrounding alcohol that makes it tougher. Like, I've never had a girl on Tinder hit me up and say 'Hey let's go out to this really cool new place near me and shoot up!.' I've never had a friend ring me and ask if I wanted to smoke a balloon and watch some hockey. This happens all the time with alcohol. \n\nLast time I quit drinking I made it nearly a month. Well, that's not correct. Last time I lasted about 24 hours. The time BEFORE that I lasted about a month. What threw a wrench in my plans? A date. I didn't explain that I was an alcoholic who can't drink or I'll run myself in to a grave. Instead of broaching the subject I had a beer or two with the date. Six or so months later I can't remember her name but I'm right back to killin' racks and suckin' down vodka. \n\nI'm not sure this all has a point, but I was thinking about it today at work. How the hell do I quit heroin cold turkey and never relapse, but fucking PBR and bottom shelf vodka gets the better of me? Whatever, it's been rattling around my head all day, felt good to write it out. Hope y'all have a nice day. \n\nI won't drink with you today, nor will we do heroin haha",

I\u2019ve been going to therapy for my anxiety and depression. My boss understands and is supportive in my failure to be a decent human being, insisting he knows that I\u2019m awesome since I\u2019ve been with the company so long and used to be a rockstar. \n\nI work from home and I force myself to sit at my desk and try to get stuff done. I usually don\u2019t accomplish much and I just sit here and stress.\n\nI just feel like I\u2019m such in a rut! The last 6 months I\u2019ve sucked terribly and I can\u2019t get back to rockstar status.  I try to pump myself up and get motivated but I backslide. Maybe I\u2019m just not as good as I used to be? I need any advice on getting out of this career rut. My job is in sales and it\u2019s stressful and my slacking is starting to show in my numbers. I love my job I just need to to figure out how to turn it around so I can keep it. ",

Accusing me of things I didn\u2019t do stuff I didn\u2019t say, and telling me how wrong it is that I talk to people about her actions. These torments have been going since I was 16, they did a pretty good number on me and last year I hit a point of depression that I almost wrote my s.letter. A big part of it was this constant state of isolation and embarrassment that she would throw at me. Up until then I always thought I could tough it out till I graduate in order to afford independence at the time I wanted. Now I\u2019m at a point in my life where idk what the fuck I\u2019m doing wrong. My siblings are a year away from graduating college and were able to push themselves out of the house and succeed. My depression and anxiety are coming back to dangerous highs, I\u2019ve isolated myself from almost the entirety of my family, and idk if I honestly trust anyone. Therapy was helpful, but this waves of chaos that are created in my life are just not solving it for me. I\u2019m sorry I rambled on, I just really don\u2019t have anyone to talk to about all this, I tried family but they threw me under the bus and told her and that\u2019s just even more drama for another post. \nHonestly just want advice, I\u2019m debating taking out a loan in order to afford to move out with some people I know, but idk if I\u2019m making a mistake or not.....",

I'm 27 now and watch myself deteriorate physically and mentally as my alcohol intake steadily increases. When I lost my grandmother and developed type 1 diabetes within a short space of time my drinking became pretty much a daily thing. What started as a bottle of wine every other night has developed into not being able to sleep properly without a bottle of whiskey.\n\nI've been pulled up once or twice by my family and promised to reduce my drinking. Instead of reducing my drinking I've just become more proficient at hiding and disposing empty bottles. I rotate between 3 or 4 supermarkets to buy drink so I don't 'look' like an alcoholic buying booze. I realise now this is the behaviour of someone with a problem.\n\nI'm blessed with wonderful people in my life, but I've never discussed these issues in much detail. I know my drinking will eventually harm these people if it hasn't already and I don't want that to happen. My drinking didn't used to effect my job but I've missed a good 2-3 shifts in the past few months because I was too hungover to go in. I was supposed to work New Year's Day but attempted to overdose on insulin on NYE and spent the night in hospital. I've had various therapies and been prescribed anxiety/depression meds but these are useless unless I stop drinking.\n\nIn social situations, I simply cannot control my drinking even though I promise myself I won't overindulge. I went to a house party for my girlfriend's birthday on Saturday. The plan was for me to stay the night but I woke up the next day in my own bed with absolutely no recollection how I got back.\n\nAlcoholism killed my Granddad. It killed my dad and I know if carry on down this path, it will kill me, especially when I already have type 1 diabetes.\n\nI discovered this subreddit a few days ago. Reading the experiences and stories of everyone here has given the clarity that I can, and will stop drinking. \n\nHere's to day 1!",

I recently learned my friend is in this situation.\n\nMy friend\u2019s dad lives close to her and her family, but they only see each other a couple times a year, despite the fact that he has a very cute toddler grandson. My friend\u2019s mom died when she was young, so my friend doesn\u2019t really have any other family except for her husband and their young son. Her father announced while they were setting up for the grandson\u2019s birthday that he had six months to live because he has entered advanced stages of cirrhosis. The doctors have tried to get him to stop drinking. He is moving to be close to his siblings, presumably to die there. I remember seeing him at the birthday party, and he was holding onto a small coke can for the whole two hours in a way that, along with his demeanor, made me wonder if he was drinking alcohol (I didn\u2019t know any of this backstory at the time). It kind of makes it doubly sad, doesn\u2019t it? He tells his daughter he is dying from alcohol as he is drinking alcohol. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what the moral of the story is except that it helps me steel my will against drinking because I have a young son. I think many of us could have ended up this way if the conditions had been just so, and those of us who have been able to stop have been so damn lucky so far. It also reminds me of how dangerous alcohol is, and that I don\u2019t want to push my luck by taking a drink. \n\nBerry La Croix cheers, y\u2019all.

   "selftext": "This past week I have gone days without taking kratom at all, and at most I'm taking 3-4 grams per day to help me sleep and do the 'taper' like I originally planned. This was an unexpected attempt at TAPERING. And I feel GREAT. Please stick with me - \n\nI've been crying out to this community for advice on what to do. My addiction felt so bad I just KNEW I needed something like suboxone to help me come off of it. Actually, it was all the other unhealthy practices in my life that was making everything worse than it had to be. \n\nI asked advice on taking subs to get off of this, because my withdrawal has been so severe in the past. I've tried quitting cold turkey at least 3 times now. **The last time I did it, I guess about a year ago, I made it a month and a half until a full blown relapse.** I mean I could not function without it. I was miserable to everyone around me. And for the sake of my job, and for my interactions with my son, I decided to get back on it. I thought I'd just take a little to function healthily. You know how this thing works and I found myself taking 30-45 grams a day, even though I felt like shit all the time I kept taking more thinking it was the only thing that could make me feel better - when in reality, it was the thing keeping me down.\n\nRecently, I asked for advice on taking suboxone or something of the sort for help getting off of this. Almost unanimously people were telling me to taper. They said it was the only way - and they were right, in my case. \n\nI started slowing down my usage, with no actual plans to come off of this drug right away. That was around 3 weeks to a month ago. Well between my alcoholism and other problems I was having in my life I decided to take some time off of work. I asked for 2 and a half weeks. The first half of the week I really cut my usage, massively. Stopped drinking and just did what I could to get by. It was difficult. In fact I didn't even realize that my lethargy, restlessness at night, loss of appetite, etc etc were all to blame simply because I cut my dosage. Sounds ridiculous after I've been through it before, but it was when the diarrhea hit that I realized I was actually withdrawing. Believe it or not this gave me courage. **I realized I had made a big step.** \n\nLast week, my first full week off of work, I went days without taking kratom and the days that I did I kept it very small. I was taking around 6 grams on the days that I did. At first it was difficult, I had a lot of trouble sleeping. But it was nowhere near as bad as when I went CT, and this time I was determined. So towards the end of the week I not only decided to stick to 2-4 grams a day IF I USED AT ALL, but I asked here about supplements. \n\n**This is where everything changed for me. The usefulness of supplements cannot be understated.** That next morning when I woke up and did not feel the NEED for kratom was incredible. I had breakfast without taking any, and admittedly, I started getting the symptoms. Mildly. The sweats, temperature fluctuations, restlessness. After eating I was stuck with it for a little while. But I took all my supplements and felt much better, and I ended up taking only 2 grams that day. Felt great for the rest of the day. **On two grams, I felt great.** Again, woke up with no urgency to take kratom. Again ate breakfast without taking a morning dose, and the withdrawal symptoms presented themselves, VERY mildly. In fact they went away after 20 minutes or so with no help from anything else. I went the rest of that day without dosing and took 1 gram to help me get a good night's rest that night. Slept beautifully, woke up again feeling like a million bucks.\n\nNow my sex drive is back, I'm thinking clearly again, my emotions feel real, I'm motivated to take care of my business...and I'm down to 2-4grams per day. Still tapering. I feel no urgency to do any more than I am now, and I also feel no urgency to pull the rug out from under myself. I'm going to continue tapering until I feel comfortable jumping off completely. It does not feel overwhelming at all any more. It feels like something I'm in the process of conquering. \n\nMuch love to those of you who encouraged me, who told me what supplements to get and advised me on tapering. **Before anyone gets concerned about me spiking the ball before I cross into the inzone, I am very well aware that this is a very serious matter. I have absolutely no option but to either give up or to finally beat these addictions and start living a healthy life, now. I'm done with excuses.** I'm seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist tomorrow. Now begins healing.\n\nIf anyone is interested in my supplement regimen, I'd be happy to share. I take supplements in the morning, midday, and at night before bed. Quite a few, actually, but they are all natural such as fish oil and magnesium, things of the sort. All of them together made a massive difference, that was when I REALLY started to feel better.\n\nJust wanted to share, everyone. My appetite is coming back, at EVERY point I'm fighting to do the right thing. **I want to let you all know that tapering is effective and can be done while continuing to function. Supplements made a huge difference for me as well. Every one of you who is struggling with this should take that into consideration. CT is just not for some of us.**",

All those post are keeping me afloat.\n\nThe more I read the more I feel the need for a support group such as AA. The thing is AA is really not appealing to me. The belief side of it is against everything I believe and don't get me wrong I have no problem with Christians or any other religious community. I am married to a strong believer, I go to mass (mainly to please her) and my own belief are constantly being challenged. The problem is that the steps are not something I can live with and I strongly disapprove the need for a superior being to heal me. I think it has to come from me and nobody else.\n\nI don't know how this will translate in English but ther is saying that goes by: \"help yourself and God will help you'. Well I think for alcoholism it has to come from myself. Not judging here, whatever works for you is great but the AA program is not for me.\n\nNow to the point, what are the alternatives. I couldn't find anything in my own town. I heard about Smart recovery but no group are available to me. I am open to any suggestions. I would prefer a face to face thing but online option are welcomed as well.\n\nThanks a lot SD buddies. I am reaching the 2 weeks mark because of you.\nIWNDWYT.  ",

As soon as I get home from work around 10pm my mood goes to shit and the depression sets in. I never realized how much I craved being around people all the time and isolation has just been  brutal. I don't have any sober friends so I have no one to hit up. Been trying to go to meetings to fill the time, but there aren't any this late. To be honest if it weren't for the antabuse I'm on, I would have drank last night. Even drove to the bar but left right after parking once I decided the sickness I'll feel from drinking on antabuse wasn't worth it. So I guess it is doing it's job.

He was an alcoholic, emotionally and physically abusive but I was dumb enough to stay with him for 7 years. \n\n3 years ago, I had broken up with Kevin but he had gotten sober, so we were tentatively back together. I still thought about Josh from time to time but I had someone so I could kind of shut it off, even though I was very aware that I still had a crush. Josh hit me up one day, not knowing I was back with Kevin and asked me to hang out and catch up, which I thought was totally innocent. While we were hanging out, sparks were flying, and Josh admitted to me that \u201chad we ever been single at the same time, I\u2019d definitely have asked you out\u201d. I was floored and had no idea how to react so I just playfully shushed him and was like \u201cI just got back together with Kevin, please please let\u2019s just pretend you didn\u2019t tell me that\u201d. I wanted to break up with Kevin right then, I knew I wasn\u2019t super happy with him but I felt like I had to stay with him because he got sober for me. But for the next 3 years I still thought about Josh a lot. He started dating a girl a year or so ago and based on fb they seem really happy. I ended up marrying Kevin, because, honestly, I was happy enough most of the time and didn\u2019t know how to break up with someone. \n\n3 years later I learn about an alumni event Josh and I are both attending and I\u2019m SO excited to catch up with him. We met up at an alumni event and I casually mentioned that I was getting divorced while we were catching up. I jokingly asked why he never told me Kevin was such a dick and he said \u201cI think I was very clear how I felt about the situation\u201d which kind of confirmed to me I didn\u2019t imagine the conversation years prior. We hung out all night and talked like old times but somehow in the 12 hours we were together he never once mentioned he had a girlfriend. We definitely flirted a little, but also it was just like when we were young and we were close friends. He even ended up crashing in my hotel room, I assume because we\u2019ve just got that good of a friend history that it wasn\u2019t weird to share a bed. (I\u2019m trying to assume everything was as innocent as possible). \n\nObviously this reignited my old crush back to full force. It felt like he still had somewhat of a crush too, but even if he did, that\u2019s beside the point. \n\nSorry for the wall of text, I just feel like background is necessary since this isn\u2019t just some random crush on a near stranger that never went away! \n\n\nHow do I get over this crush? Now that I\u2019m single I don\u2019t have someone to redirect my feelings too. It\u2019s been nearly a decade since I\u2019ve had a crush like this and it\u2019s absolutely miserable. I\u2019m constantly kicking myself for not leaving Kevin years ago when I knew I wasn\u2019t happy. Any advice to get past this? \n\ntldr; How to get over a decade old crush that was requited at the wrong time and is now (probably) unrequited?",

Further, I really have all my skills as a human being surrounding this job... I simply can't just go do something else (well nothing that will support me both financially as good as this and be something I actually want to do). Plus, I can think of very few jobs where you aren't around alcohol at least some of the time. I've wanted to do this job since before I started college, seriously, this is something I've dreamed about doing for so, so long. \n\nWell, I figured that since now I'm generally \"happy\" compared to generally miserable in the past that perhaps I would be different when I drank now. Nope. I had a day off and went by myself to a local bar and had a drink which led to a few more... I said some things loudly that some of the patrons didn't like and I didn't take it well when I was asked to leave. Now, I screwed up ROYALLY by name dropping my friends/coworkers. Well, in the end they ended up picking me up and taking me home and I was still quite frazzled by the experience, ranting about it to them.\n\nLong story short, if I didn't have my specific skill set and hadn't contributed SO much to this team, they told me I would be fired. They told me they basically wanted to smack me right there for compromising their years of hard work and reputation. Most jobs would fire you for this even though it didn't happen on company property they said. \n\nSo it's out in the open. Everyone I work with has seen how I am when I drink now or at least heard. I honestly wanted to tell them earlier but I just feared loss of this opportunity and hadn't really proved myself at that point as an asset to the company/team/bands until now. \n\nSo, I'm not off the team/out of the job. But I can never pick up another drink in or outside of my job. Help me please! Help!",

   "selftext": "I have a question that has been bothering me for a while and was hoping an addict or recovering addict might help answer it. \n\nSo my brother is an alcoholic/drug user (heroin, methadone, crack, codine coke etc)...Though bad in itself, the thing that really killed all empathy I had for him was the physical and emotional violence he has committed. The Story...  two years ago he suckered a rich but naive (and emotionally vulnerable) woman into marrying him (he shortly-after stopped w0rking citing anxiety and depression issues and leeched off her full-time). Weeks before the wedding he even admitted that he didn\u2019t love her, said she was dumb and boring, but felt that \u201cGod\u201d wanted them to marry (he is super religious)\n\nLong story short, she divorced him last month- during the proceedings it came out that he beat her quite a few times, tried to strangle her with such violence that he fractured bones in her neck, and abused her emotionally as well... He also did disgusting things to \u201cpunish\u201d her when she didn\u2019t act the way he wanted her to... For instance, when she once accidentally called him by her ex-husband\u2019s name, he called a prostitute in front of her and lined up a sexual liaison for himself because she was a \"bad wife\" that \"clearly still wanted to sleep with her ex\". \n\nHe would also keep her prisoner in their bedroom and she had to ask his permission \u201cas the god appointed head of the household\u201d to make food for her kids...I mean everything we heard is just really vile and shitty stuff.\nWhen my mother found out about all this she just broke down... She is refusing to accept that this is her baby boy (42-years old!) and is blaming all of his behavior on drugs and alcohol. \n\n\n\nI want to know if this is true in any-one\u2019s experience? Personally I also had a history with drugs before getting clean some years ago, I could never, ever, have treated anyone this way while high.It is literally unthinkable to me...\n\n I think my brother is a truly dangerous person -and that his behavior cannot be blamed on drugs. Does anyone have a contrary opinion?\n\nCan drugs/alcohol make anyone act completely out of character to this extent. \n\n(PS he was not high/drunk during some of these incidents \u2013notably the emotional abuse incidents)\n\nEDIT: The Reason I'm asking is because my mother is considering taking him in after he comes out of rehab. It is probably his 10th time in rehab &amp; my mom (73) is pretty frail and a pensioner on a fixed income. I am scarred my brother's behaviour indicates something far darker than just addiction issues and think this is a very bad idea...especially if my mother is blind to his \"real\" issues and thus unable to protect herself emotionally (and physically even)",

I see it on reality TV shows all the time. Not naming any show or network, but one day one of the girls left a bottle of vodka in the shower in case she wanted a drink while showering. On another show, one of the girls was so drunk she sat on her roommate's bed and peed. She said didn't remember doing it. Yep, blackout drunk. And there are so many bar fights, bad experiences and other alcohol related incidents on so many reality TV shows that totally mirror user experiences here at r/stopdrinking that I can only shake my head and say \"yep, alcoholics in the making showing all their fans how it's done.\" At least one guy on one show who was notorious for getting in trouble has cleaned up his act and openly admits his sobriety. Imagine a reality show where they take 8 party animals who have gone too far, and followed them through a summer of detox/rehab and avoiding situations where alcohol would do them in. Sadly, I don't think it would get good ratings.",

For a little background, I have dealt with drinking for the larger part of a decade and my last bout of sobriety lasted for a year. I am a highly functional alcoholic and aside from my personal health, my pocket book would always take the largest brunt from my actions.\n\n I took my time a prepared well for this (hopefully my forever) bout of  sobriety and feel lucky coming from 8-10 liquor drinks a day to having little to no withdrawal.

It's incredibly addicting.  Beautiful naked women choosing to proudly display their natural bodies?  Y chromosome glowing a red hotter than it ever had with studio porn.  \n\nI met porn in a buddy's basement in the eighth grade, which was about 20 years ago.  Then I met Kazaa, the green porn genie.  Never really thought I was addicted until I'd routinely spend an hour or two clicking through images and videos.  Not necessarily every day, but often enough to worry the minder-mentor that lives in my brain.  Gut check told me to stop, and I have occasionally, though only intermittently.  On a streak of addiction currently, like how an alcoholic falls off the wagon.  \n\nThere's some really interesting neurochemistry going on here.  Short term goal achieved; I've blown my load inside a digital vagina.  But where did my long term goals go?  I don't even care because I've tricked my primal primate brain into thinking \"you have won the race today, my friend\".   \n\nSome day humanity will understand everything there is to know about addiction.  It will probably usher in an era of unparalleled scientific advancement and worldwide cooperation.  Why?  I think the same neural circuits that influence addiction influence us to do bad things to others.  Cooperation is less immediately gratifying then getting what we want RIGHT NOW.\n\nLet's keep talking about it.  Let's get to the bottom of it.   Let's achieve the things we were meant to. \n\nI started a blog years ago to serve as a creative outlet, and maybe as an alternative way to stoke the hungry dopamine circuit that keeps me attached to the familiar pleasure producers and a little afraid of new experience.  I tend to get a bit abstract with my writing, but the goal is to become a better communicator; to develop a style that is illustrative and less wordy.  What creative outlets have you found?       \n\nWish me luck.  I want to hear about your achievements exploring a lifestyle away from easy pleasure.

   "selftext": "Hi /r/PTSD. Apologies in advance for the length of this, my brain isn't firing on all cylinders at the moment.\n\nI never post here, just lurk but I just need to vent, I suppose. Some advice would be appreciated, my head is a mess right now.\n\nI grew up in a household that was abusive. A typical \"broken home\" scenario - single parent, alcoholic, sociopath/narcissist, controlling, all that. Part of his controlling was making sure I had *zero* privacy. I had my stuff gone through more times than I can count. I had my PC browsed through (unbeknownst to me as it was over our home network until I caught my dad doing it) daily, my personal conversations picked through with a fine-toothed comb (during my teenage years to boot, and I used MSN which saved everything to handy HTML files!) and he never knocked before walking into my bedroom. We don't have to be geniuses to work out what teenage boys do a lot of and why not knocking is a horrible idea... anyway. I ended up being diagnosed with PTSD because of the abuse and neglect. It took me years to develop any level of trust with my partner and she was okay with that. She understood the reason why.\n\nAs a result, I value my privacy *a lot*. I don't like my stuff being messed with, I don't like people prying. It's just who I am - I'm a very private person. All of my gadgets are fairly locked down (encrypted, I use a VPN, TouchID on my iPhone, PIN on my watch that sort of stuff).\n\nFast forward to Friday just gone. I don't want to get into the nitty-gritty but me and my partner don't really have sex so she's happy for me to get my kicks online, shall we say. I have a sort of digital \"friends with benefits\" arrangement with a girl a third of the planet away (I'm in the UK, she's in the American Midwest). I've never met her but we both understand the agreement and we're both happy. She's real, I'm real, we're both adults, nobody is getting catfished or scammed... it's a means to an end that we're both okay with. My partner was also happy with this arrangement, and actually suggested it as an alternative to paying for sex which we'd discussed on and off but I'd never gone through with. Or so I thought.\n\nI was downstairs, chatting to her parents (I/we live with them, we're supposed to be saving up for a mortgage deposit) and my watch dinged with a Snapchat notification. Okay, cool. I'll get it when I go back upstairs because I left my phone on my desk. I finished the conversation and went back upstairs, checked my phone and the chat on Snapchat said \"Opened 5m ago\" and not \"New Chat\". If anybody hasn't used Snapchat here, once you open a message and close the chat again, it disappears. You can't ever get it back. I turned to my partner and she asked me if she could ask me a question about something she'd seen on Snapchat. Oh shit. She's been on my phone. Edit: She also lied about it and lied about knowing my passcode at first too.\n\nNow, I want to add in that I have nothing to hide, other than I don't want her seeing conversations where I'm sexting with this girl. She knows the arrangement, she suggested it. I *thought* she was happy with it and she's never suggested otherwise. I thought it was an unwritten rule that even if she did go on my phone, she shouldn't open Snapchat - she knows that's how we talk. I wasn't sure if she knew my passcode but I trusted her implicitly *not to go on my phone* if she did. Why wouldn't I... we've been a couple for 8 years, we're supposed to be getting married in 5 months. I thought we were at the point I could trust my own fianc\u00e9e.\n\nHer angle was pretty ballsy, I will be honest. She wanted me to clarify something she'd seen on there that'd been saved from a previous conversation (something totally innocent, I should add). I responded by going ape-shit and flying off the handle - it's now Tuesday and I'm still seething with anger. I feel like the trust I worked so hard to build and the work I put in improving myself by going to therapy, dealing with the anger and the fact I was quick to be violent (old habits die hard...), dealing with and accepting the fact I've also got ADHD and autism, becoming a better man and not following in the footsteps of my dad is just... gone. Destroyed. Utterly fucked. I feel betrayed and completely alone because she was the only person I trusted on this entire planet. I can't even look at her even 4 days later and I've barely spoken to her since. \n\nShe claims she's only done it this one time but I don't trust she won't do it again no matter how much she says she won't - I don't know how I'm supposed to marry this woman in 5 months if there's no trust. I've built my life up from nothing and now I'm stuck - do I stay and feel like I let her get off easy and that I'm a pushover, or do I leave and have nothing at all again? She'll still have a place to live, her parents to support her, enough money to be okay, her friends. I'll have nothing - no furniture, not enough money to live on my own (I work 16 hours a week because I'm finishing a vocational IT course but I start a full time apprenticeship in July that'll pay \u00a320k/$27k), no friends because \"our\" friends are actually \"her\" friends I've met through her...\n\nI don't know what I'm supposed to do. \n\nThanks for reading this.",

I have spent so long hiding it and keeping it to myself that the fact it\u2019s coming out (probably because of a lot of factors, but I\u2019m on the road to progress so that\u2019s one good thing) is absolutely scaring me. I don\u2019t like people knowing. But this is a safe space and I am just hoping getting it out eases some of that. I\u2019m sorry. You don\u2019t have to read it. Trigger warning. \n\nI\u2019m one of two. I have a sister. My parents were divorced by the time I was 2 years old, I don\u2019t even remember them being together. The relationship was not a healthy one, and both parents had their major issues. \n\nMy father: \nMost likely a paranoid schizophrenic who unfortunately went untreated. He believed in many government conspiracies and just thought everyone was out to get him. This made him very paranoid and volatile. He would have cameras around the house and outside. No cell phones or strange technology he didn\u2019t get himself and check out. \n\nHe was also sexually and physically abusive to my sister and I. We were working 12 hour days before we were 10 at scrap yards and auctions. He took all the money under the table. The house was a mess, cat and dog shit, just no way to be clean. It was embarrassing to be so filthy in public. It didn\u2019t matter how hot I got the shower or how hard I scrubbed, I couldn\u2019t get clean - and not just from the smell. I don\u2019t want to get into all of that though. But it was just hard. \n\nMy dad pointed a gun at my sister and I and threatened to kill us, and again threatened to commit a double homicide/suicide. That\u2019s when we were pulled from the house. And the therapy began. I don\u2019t remember the therapy. But I remember going from a very angry kid - someone who screamed and yelled and stole and got in trouble, to a very docile young lady who got straight A\u2019s and learned an instrument.\n\nThey didn\u2019t expect my mom though - so the first round of therapy seemed to only help deal with my dads trauma. Which is in the past and I\u2019ve primarily moved on. \n\nMy mom most likely has NPD with Bipolar 2. Again, undiagnosed. My mom self medicated with alcohol and Opiates. My sister and I went from my dads house and being pulled from the house at the age of 12 to living with a drug addict and closet alcoholic. \n\nWe lived in 20 different places in my 18 years with her. The first 5 were until the age of 10. We lost 15 homes in 8 years following. My mom used rent and bill money for drugs and diet Mountain Dew and her cable. She didn\u2019t parent, she passed out and then overcompensated by screaming at my sister and I for the mess around her. We were blamed by the family and my grandfather, who was my fp, for the mess because my mom was just \u201csick\u201d. We should have been helping her. It was our fault as kids that she couldn\u2019t parent us.  She blamed it on a whole bunch of medical conditions I don\u2019t even know are true. \n\nI escaped. My sister and I eventually got away and moved out on our own. I had put my nose to the books and just worked my ass off. I continued to work my ass off in college, but depression meds weren\u2019t working and I didn\u2019t understand. Shouldn\u2019t I have gotten better now that I\u2019m medicated and away from all of that? \n\nI left my religion the same time I graduated. Around this same time I stopped working so hard and finally accomplished the career I was working towards. And I spiraled. I had a really tough time. I began my first relationship (sexual for the first time after being in a very conservative religion) and my brain didn\u2019t know how to handle it. I spiraled further. Brought the poor guy who was admittedly using me for sex on a roller coaster ride with me. \n\nI was raped by someone I knew. And I snapped. Made an attempt and was diagnosed. It clicked. What was wrong, why the anti-depressants weren\u2019t working and what I needed to do. It\u2019s taken me almost 7 months after that attempt, and a year after my first real spiral to finally be on the road to recovery and recognize everything. \n\nI\u2019m here. I made it. I survived. I\u2019m still surviving, breathing and fighting and living through everyday. Those experiences really roughened me out in some ways, and in others made me a really kind person. I\u2019m going to embrace my past and finally move on. I\u2019ve got this and so do you if you are still reading. You can do it too. ",

I\u2019m trying to explain the utter retardation of my drinking. \n\nI had a very shitty childhood and from the age of around 15 I drank heavily because it\u2019s what all the cool kids do. I didn\u2019t really notice it was a problem until I was in my early 30s. Skipping work, puking every day, blackouts etc. \n\nMy wife and I, when we first met, would get drunk and laugh etc until she noticed that I\u2019d become a massive prick the more I drank. Not abusive, just argumentative and annoying. So I started drinking in secret. On the way home from work (bus not driving), any time I went to buy groceries - so she wouldn\u2019t see it. I\u2019m a highly functioning alcoholic most of the time.\n\nThen one night about two years ago, I woke about 3am drunk as hell, sat on the edge of the bed and started urinating, thinking I was on a toilet. She woke and so did I.  Rather than lie and make out I was \u2018sleep walking\u2019 or something , I broke down and told her the truth. I\u2019ve got a problem. And I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nThe next day she organised an appointment with a drugs and alcohol counsellor whom I saw for around six months once a week. They booked me in for a ten day detox and off I went. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the most positive experience for me tbh. I spent ten days being berated for choosing booze over the \u2018important things\u2019 in life and once my time was done, the first thing I did when I left was buy a bottle of wine to drink on the way home. More as a \u2018fuck you\u2019 than anything else. I\u2019m well aware of how destructive and stupid that was. \n\nThat was a year ago. \n\nAnd although I don\u2019t drink as much as I did I\u2019m still drinking heavily but exclusively in secret. Because as I said I can drink and hide it very well. \n\nBut I\u2019m killing myself. And I have so many reasons to be sober. But I can\u2019t seem to shake this bullshit. \n\nEvery time I drink I hate myself. Every day I wake and say \u2018nope not today\u2019 yet find myself on auto pilot buying booze and tipping it down my throat. \n\nPlease forgive the long, self pitying rambling. I just wanted to be open and honest about this in a forum of people that might understand.  \n\nI\u2019ve tried AA and the whole god thing irks me.

I still don't, but I wanted to post some thoughts I have on alcoholism and mental health issues/disability, and ask some questions of people who have managed long stretches of sobriety. Apologies in advance.\n\nI'm a 35 year old man, and was diagnosed with autism two years ago (I will return to this shortly). I've been a functioning alcoholic for around five years now, with a marked turn for the worse in quantity and frequency of drinking in the last year or so. I started drinking fairly late, around my mid 20s, mainly to assuage the social problems that autism - or more precisely, the way autistic people are supposed to shoehorn themselves into societal systems that are completely unsuited and basically unnatural to us - has caused for me. I had been an awkward loner throughout my teenage years and early twenties, but I discovered alcohol and how it made me feel more open and less awkward and dysfunctional. This isn't to say I'm absolved of responsibility for my situation, but more of an explanatory device. \n\nI work in an extremely pressurised environment in an ambulance service (dw I never went in drunk, and rarely went in hungover) where I have dealt with tens of thousands of incidents, many of them extremely unpleasant. That side of the job has never bothered me, but I think the pressure has finally taken its toll. The NHS in the UK was subjected to the most intense pressure in at least 20 years last winter and I don't think it is a coincidence that my drinking and mental health nosedived over the course of, it to the point that I had to request a move off of frontline duties before I went off on long term sick, or killed myself. It was a very bad time. I was drinking heavily every day I wasn't in work, usually around 10 cans of cider and a few bottles of beer. My usual bed was the floor in my living room.\n\nMy drinking has basically developed from social to boredom drinking. I never wake up in the morning wanting or needing a drink but it's when that half hour before the off licence shuts time comes around my resolve just crumbles. I'm sure some of you know that feeling. I know I'm an alcoholic tho, just a different type of alcoholic than to some. I've had several good attempts at getting sober but I just crack each time. I'm on three days atm. \n\nOne of the problems I have is that I *know* that even without boozing my problems won't go away. I'm going to be autistic until the day that I die. I'm not going to have a social life because all my friends drink alcohol non stop and I a) can't moderate or stay on soft drinks and b) can't make friends without the crutch. So I'm trying to be sober but I'm not really enthusiastic about it, or jumping for joy at feeling better, I'm just sad because I know that my life is probably going to be one of solitude. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading. I have a couple of questions for long term ppl if anyone could answer them.\n",

   "selftext": "So i\u2019ve just finished my first year of college and things went very bad. First semester I got 2 C+, 1 B-, and one A-. Second semester i got 2 A\u2019s and a B. This was all as a Biology major. I struggled with lingering depression from severe bullying in high school by students as well as a few teachers along with a decade or so of verbal and physical abuse from my brother. I also had extremely loud, alcoholic dorm-mates who would blast music and yell half the day &amp; night.\n\nI feel that my chances of med school are looking bleak and my chances of a top one are basically out the window now. I have a much stronger aptitude and love for english, history, etc. and have switched my major to government &amp; politics and trying to go to law school. \n\nHowever, i\u2019ve heard law graduates \u201cdon\u2019t get jobs\u201d and law students are seen as pre meds who couldn\u2019t handle it. Also, in high school(&amp; life in general) it was viewed that the smart people focused and excelled in science &amp; math and english, history, etc. were for those who couldn\u2019t excel in math &amp; science. This is adding to my depression as I don\u2019t want to be seen as some loser who couldn\u2019t handle pre-med and switched his life to pre-law. I used to be the top student all my life until about 11th grade when the aforementioned bullying took an extreme hit on my mind. \n\nI also can\u2019t get past this one particular teacher who used to tease me all the time (teased me after the year I had her as well). She knew I was awkward and had no friend in her class and would purposely take advantage of me and one time in particular asked me \u201cwhat shows do you watch\u201d to which I awkwardly responded \u201cnone.\u201d She then walked over to my desk, knelt at my desk and said \u201cwhat was that\u201d and basically made me repeat \u201cnone\u201d to which she and 3 other girls who her favorites were hilariously laughed in my face. I reported her at the end of high school after staring her down and making her terrified after but I feel the only way to make peace is to take her job. What should I do?",

   "selftext": "This may come out as a bit \"stream of consciousness,\" so I apologize in advance.\n\nThis weekend I am graduating with my Masters degree. Which, in theory, should be great. My professors have taken mercy on us, and we have no real final to take in any of my classes, so this week should be easy. But it isn't. I started looking for a job in my field over six months ago. I've had one interview, and taken one test. Still nothing. It bothers me, but I understand. The field I'm in is competitive, but something will come along eventually. \n\nOn the flip side, no one else wants to hire me. I work on campus, and I'm losing my job this week. The state I'm currently living in is expensive and the job my SO works has cut their hours. We are literally on our last legs because within the last month random unexpected expenses have eaten away at our financial cushion. We are struggling, and it feels like this is my fault. I chose to move half\\-way across the country for graduate school. I chose to leave my cushy ass case worker\\-esque job to advance my career. I chose to move into a house share with two people who are good at appearing normal \\(which is a different story entirely\\) because it was all we could afford, and now we can't even afford that. \n\nThis last week has been a mess. We are out of money, and I have no idea what to do. Our roommates want us out by Friday now, even though they were the ones who demanded we stay. My aunt sounds concerned about letting us stay with her...and the one thing I was banking one, getting my job back at the theater, has fallen through. Literally we have ten bucks in the bank right now. \n\nI spoke with my mother yesterday. I called her crying, in the parking lot of my SO's job, while I waited for him to get off work, and I just...broke down. She suggested we go home. Put our stuff in storage and go home. She told me I needed a break. She's right. I do. I need a damn break. I miss my son. I haven't seen him in person since December. We're considering skipping out on the last bill we \"have\" to pay to the neighbors \\(seeing as they aren't giving us til the end of the month\\), selling our mattress and one of our tvs and heading home directly after graduation. I'll stay with my parents, and he'll stay with his brother or his friend or he'll figure out something. That's what he told me. We'll get jobs and grow our money back until we're stable, then we can come grab the rest of our shit and move back home together. ...But I don't know how I will afford my car loan or insurance for this month or the storage facility where most of our stuff has been since last year... \n\nI spoke to an old coworker/friend, and she thinks I should be able to get my old job back pretty easily. She's the boss now and wants me back regardless. It's a good job. A state job. Safe. \"Everyone loves your work.\" But it was turning me into an alcoholic. I left and told myself I wouldn't be the person who comes back, but here I am. More destitute than we have ever been in our ten years together, trying to scrape money together to drive back across country. My existence is pathetic. If I didn't have a child I would consider throwing myself from the bridge.\n\nI have considered throwing myself from the bridge. No point in lying about that.\n\nI'm tired. I don't feel safe. I'm stressed. I want to die, but I can't. I won't do that to my child.\n\nMy mom says sometimes life is just hard. I have a place to go. I've been thinking about selling my car for a used one. I can't afford her anymore. \n\nI wanted to make a better life for my family. To give my son the best life possible. I never thought ambition would be my downfall. I feel like a failure. I am a failure. \n\nBut hey, I'm graduating, right?",

   "selftext": "DISCLAIMER\n\nThere is a looong first part, where I just kind of tell my background, because I think that it influenced me and my general state of mind. \n\nIt would be too long to write everything down \\(it already is now, tbh\\), so I'll just add a quick explanation for those who don't have the time to read the whole text or who don't understand why I even wrote this stuff in the first place:\n\n\\-My mind was already complicated as a kid, it was almost impossible to get me to do anything that I didn't really want\n\n\\-I'm very bad at handling emotions because I never learned how to express them \\(or at least, I think so\\)\n\n\\-I think I might be bipolar or something, but it's just self diagnosed.\n\n\\-The story about the wrong crowd is just to tell that it took me a really long time to get a stable grip on life, and that I think that it left me behind most of my peers on an emotional level, plus it gave me a lot of emotional stuff to digest. It also left me feeling like a missfit with almost everyone, and gave me a pessimistic view on the world, which, altogether, certainly doesn't help. \n\n\\-Last point: I'm often told that I have the character of both my grandfathers. They are both remembered as strong, well respected and intelligent men, but with a very restless character and an inabillity to express their emotions in general, which lead them to strong \\(but still \"perfectly\" functioning\\) alcoholism and heavy smoking. They both died at approx. 65 years, I never really got to know them. And I don't want to go down that road too. \n\nTo skip the first part, just go to the \"NOW\"\\-paragraph.\n\nI've been a \"difficult kid\" since my early days. My teachers always told my parents how intelligent and polite I was, but also how difficult it was to get me to do anything. They'd call home and accuse me of \"passive resistance\", meaning that I wasn't actually disturbing anyone, or being a dick or whatever, I was just politely refusing to do anything, and if they forced me to do something, I just did my best to accomplish my task in the worst possible way.\n\nI'm not sure why I was like this, but anyways, in my early teenage years I had my typical teenage self\\-esteem crash, but maybe a little bit stronger than what's normal. I was a very skinny kid, and very insecure. So insecure that I feared to think, because I assumed that, maybe, other people would be able to hear what I was thinking. And I had normal thoughts, really, it's not like I was imagining how I'd kill my classmates or anything like this. \n\nI started to hang out with the wrong crowd. I decided that I needed to be hard. So I threw out all the books from my room, stopped communicating with my parents and instead started only doing pushups and listening to hip hop. Pretty stereotypical. I think that I was just afraid of life in general, and thought I would be alright as long as I was a though motherfucker, which of course I never became, since that's just not who I am. My new friends were the kind of 14 year olds to deal drugs, visit prostitutes, get into fights all the time and generally not care too much about life in general. I was not like this, so I ended up being friends with thugs and nice kids at the same time, not knowing where to fit in. I dealed drugs myself, even though I really didn't need to, my family is what you could call \"well off\". I did good, I always kept it lowkey and never ripped people off, and everybody respected me. \n\nBut I started to see how some of the pople I knew really started going down the wrong track. They stealed cars, robbed stores, started getting into struggle with the law regularly, accumulated large debts when they got caught doing graffitis all over town and then also started bombing trains. I was loosing my grip on life, I didn't know who I was anymore, and started abusing alcohol and weed. I was depressed, I think. The worst point was when a childhood friend killed two people, but it took the police almost two years to find out it was him. And this only because he told everyone, and someone finally ratted him out, for a significant sum of money, as far as I know. Some time later, a friend commited suicide, and two other firends were put into a closed psychiatry after several failed suicide attempts.\n\nAll the while, I had no one to talk to, and I just kind of took everything into me without knowing how to release it. I did a lot of sports, but my trainer was an \"ex \\-\"gangmember from a well known \\(and feared\\) latin street gang, and he basically only told us how to get harder and never show emotions, which probably wasn't exactly what I needed, either. Plus any benefits sport might have had on my mind were rapidly eradicated by downing bottles of cheap rum or smoking too much weed.\n\nI'm sure that my parents never really new about all the shit I had seen or was seeing on a daily basis, and what the people in my sourrounding were doing to my character. They just put off my lethargic behaviour as a normal teenage thing. \n\nNOW:\n\nIt's been some years since all of this \\(I've just turned 21 now\\), and I'm in college. But I can't study. I just don't feel like it, which is normal, so I just force myself to study, but I always end up failing. I've even gone so far to get all distractions away from me \\(blocked my phone, disabled any internet connection, locked my ps4 away\\), but I ended up looking at the ceiling. I think it's because of stress. I think that my teenage days were so full of negative stuff going on, and my mind so confused, that I never really learned how to deal with stress or my emotions in general, which means that the slightest distraction is able to totally get me off my studying or from really using my head in general. It's not that I am lazy, I go to the gym regularly \\(3\\-4 days/week, at 0730\\), I wash, I cook, I work a lot of hours because it feels good to at least be productive in that way and make some cash. \n\nAs soon as I start studying, though, I become absolutely restless. I start feeling stressed, depressed, apathetic. I don't understand what I'm reading, I start questioning my life, I'm not happy about anything anymore \\(this also happens when I'm not studying, but it's less disruptive to my life in general, since my job as a bartender doesn't require a lot of mental work, and neither does going to the gym or cooking\\). \n\nI don't enjoy going out anymore, because my conscience isn't clear. I don't really enjoy the company of others right now, because I'm too busy with myself. And I lack ambition, careerwise as well as leisure\\-wise. I have money that I have been saving. I could travel, I could enjoy life when I have free time, but I don't. Instead, I work or I literally waste my time, because I've made the experience that I'm not happy with myself, that I can't enjoy things. \n\nI would like to get my degree, but I've been failing this year. I only passed 3 finals out of 9, and my parents are tired of seeing me like this, so they've announced that they'll kick me out this summer until I decide to study seriously again. I already pay for most of my stuff \\(clothes, phone, eating out, transportation, leisure, gym, etc\\) and have a considerable amount of money left each month. Also, I already have two jobs, so I'm not worried about the financial aspects that much, I could just do some more hours at my jobs and I'd be fine, I wouldn't have too much struggle paying my rent. But it would mean stopping my education \\(or only progressing very slowly, since I would lack time to study seriously\\) and being stuck with only a highschool diploma, which would leave me in a bad place in later life. \n\nAny advice on how I could get past this struggle and focus on my finals? Right now, I need a short term solutions for this month, but I'd also appreciate general advice for my situation, and what I should do if I fail my finals again. I'm opposed to taking aderall or something like this, even though the times I did take it \\(self prescribed\\), it helped me to stay focused a lot.\n\nThanks",

   "selftext": "I don't even know what to say...thank you comes to mind. This sub got the ball rolling for me and has been more helpful than any other tool that I've tried, ever. It is here that I found \"This Naked Mind\", technically the book that pushed me over the hump. Without this sub I wouldn't have found the book. I went to my first AA meeting yesterday, at 99 days sober. I don't know why, but I felt compelled to see how they go about things. I wanted to see for myself instead of letting the devout atheists of Reddit scare me into avoiding AA strictly because of one word they use.... GOD. Please, don't ever let this be a motivating factor for you if you are thinking about AA. God is not the center of AA, it is a part, and despite what some tell you there will be no christening in a lake surrounded by cultist people in robes chanting your name. These folks are just like you and they want to help you... plain and simple. I plan to go to more meetings, just for the discussion and camaraderie alone. I went to an open discussion type meeting, there was no \"our way or the highway\" mentality. I did it my way, the Annie Grace way; which is frankly in stark contrast to their way. But THAT'S OK. They want to be and stay sober, just like you and me, and however you choose to do it doesn't seem to matter (at least to the folks I met.) Honestly though, \"This Naked Mind\" did it for me. I like the idea that I have power over this, and all I needed was a change of mentality, to rid my subconscious mind of the evil subliminal advertising of the booze industry. I like that the book doesn't make you feel broken, or different. Alcohol is massively addictive to EVERYONE, not just you. You happen to be further down the slide than \"normal drinkers.\" I like the approach that alcoholism is not a disease that some people have and others don't. Alcohol is the problem, not you, plain and simple and it can be a problem for anyone if they go long and far enough down the slide. I did this for so many reasons, and my story is so long and ridiculous and frankly embarrassing, that it will need another post and probably an alt account to summarize. If you are new here - You can do this. If I can, anyone can. It's not easy...no my friends in fact it was the hardest thing I've ever done. But let me tell you it's worth it, but you won't know it until you get past 90 days. Stick with it! I am not naive enough to think I can't fail... but I have arranged my tools to succeed. I have a digital copy of TNM on me at all times, and I read this sub daily when the urge strikes. I now know that moderation is a lie, and there is absolutely no point in drinking at all. You are literally PISSING away your life and your money, for what? Ok, I'm rambling - For now, at 100 days... just a simple thank you /r/stopdrinking. ",

During the getting-to-know-you process when I was hired in February, M mentioned that he didn\u2019t drink for health reasons, but said that he would start drinking again once his kids all graduate college (all college aged now.) Thought it a little weird that he would actively choose to start drinking again after stopping for a health problem, but okay.\n\nLast week, he ended up going to the hospital for pancreatitis. I didn\u2019t put two and two together until my other boss, J, outright told me that M has a drinking problem and that this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s had pancreatitis. Sad, but things make sense now.  J also tells me not to mention he told me this, because it\u2019s M\u2019s business and he\u2019s clearly not ready to talk about it, but that he wanted me to know because I\u2019m part of the firm and deserve to know why M has been leaving shit last minute and shunting tons of calls, etc.\n\nM comes back into the office on Monday, and I overhear a low conversation between the two of them where J is earnestly offering to help M however he can with his problem (they\u2019ve known each other for about 25 years and have been legal partners for almost as long). M thanks him, and talks about how he knows he needs to change, but it comes off somehow...nonchalant. Like \u201coh, I ended up in the hospital for my drinking again, no big deal.\u201d He just doesn\u2019t sound sincere.\n\nI pass it off originally as \u201cwell, people deal with traumatic events differently, he might just be internalizing it, stop projecting.\u201d But today, he\u2019s taking calls from clients who are asking how he\u2019s doing, knowing that he was out last week. He tells them about being in the hospital for pancreatitis very casually- \u201cOh, they pumped me full of magnesium and potassium, it was like a vacation.\u201d\n\n....dude. Vacation? Really?\n\nIt\u2019s sad because he\u2019s extremely successful and I hate to see him not taking this seriously. I\u2019m still not sure if I should say anything, because as J said, M is clearly not ready to own up to it, and I\u2019ve only been here a few months.\n\nAnyone else experience something like this?

I very much remember that amazing mood you are in as you are amongst your peers and still trying to catch your breath. Many of us remained active in school, high school, and even college. Notice it was generally the preps who were consistently happy and pro-active whereas the stoners/goths/punks were the low-energy sad ones?\n\n---\n\n**The true nature of chemical dependency**\n\nSo we spend our entire youths establishing the habit of endorphin chemical rush.

The chemical reward system is very real\n\n\n---\n\n**Alcholism**\n\nMoving into adult-hood, we've unknowingly messed up this chemical system and are able to use alcohol to achieve the same sense of reward. I do not deny that alcohol feels good as it is triggering the same chemical response as hard-work. (But I won't argue with the horribly destructive consequences)\n\n\n---\n\n**Resolution**\n\nI always disliked the coping mechanisms we give to beginners when it comes to alcoholism. When one recovering from alcoholism makes it beyond the physical aspects of the addicting, they are left with potentially a life-time of psychological addiction.\n\nI've gone for long and thoughtful walks thinking it would curve my thirst for the drink to no avail. Likewise, replacing alcohol with a non-alcoholic drink was not sufficient. And I jokingly say if someone recommends I take on some incredibly boring hobby like basket-weaving in order to 'Keep myself distracted\" then I'm going to grow depressed as I yearn for any type of meaning and reward.\n\n\n---\n\n**Reward**\n\nThat yearning for chemical reward is just as real as the alcoholism. It is not a void but a burning desire. I've found lifting weights, running. Go jogging, swimming, and pushing myself to be 100% effective.\n\nIt was only when I found this incredible link between the mind and body that I was finally able to control my drinking. Your body longs for this chemistry and you do NOT need alcohol to live it.\n\nI will not drink with you all.",

And for me personally, I am addicted to porn, and moderation has not worked at all, so it\u2019s probably not good for me.\n\n**2** You\u2019re no going to masturbate, you\u2019re just gonna watch porn.\n\nThis never works. You\u2019ll spend an hour having a porn binge, and then your won\u2019t be able to resist touching that bulge in your pants. And an hour later, you\u2019re back where you were before. Back to square one.\n\n**3** I\u2019ve already relapsed, may as well make it the best relapse ever!\n\nThis is so common, but it really seriously hurts your progress. Hinges take you completely back to square one. \u201c**Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day, but it was burned done in one night**\u201d. Binges make progress so much harder, I\u2019ve experienced it myself. This rationalisation especially (If you listen to it) can hurt your progress significantly.\n\n*Great, now I know what some rationalisations are, and why they are damaging. So what do I do about it?*\n\nWhen you do encounter a rationalisation/excuse, just try to tell yourself this: **I didn\u2019t come this far to come this far**. It may sound like another of those meaningless motivational quotes, but if you repeat that in your mind enough, it really does help significantly. ",

   "selftext": "Wrong place for relationship advice? This may seem a little unconventional, however I feel like I need the opinion of those who are not involved in my life...so here it goes; I have been with my boyfriend for about 4 years now. We have lived together 2 of those years and recently adopted an adorable pup. My boyfriend is a kind, sensitive, loving soul. I have never doubted how much he loves me. \n\nNow you are probably asking \"so whats wrong?\"...well, although he is 30 and I am 26, I have a full\\-time job with 401K and benefits and he still does not. He works two jobs, one of which is something he has a passion for but can not make it a career and the other is a job that has insane hours, a horrible boss, no benefits, and hard on his body. For 2 years I have asked him to apply for a full\\-time job with benefits because that is better for our future. He still has not done this. He always says he will once the next month slows down and that he makes plenty of money to take car of us right now.\n\nAnother concern is that he occasionally will get drunk and act a fool and I am unable to enjoy my evening because I am taking care of him. I grew up in a family where alcohol is used to enjoy in moderation, and his family drinks a lot. No, he is not an alcoholic, however his actions when he is drunk has raised some major flags for my family. They have started to loose respect for him and believe I deserve better. They say that the man should always take care of his woman and never drink the way he does. Side note, his parents have never met my parents in the 4 years we have been together. Anyways, just thought I would reach out to the public and see if anyone had some thoughts. He makes me incredibly happy when I am with him, however when we are apart I feel like I could maybe find someone better. Is that wrong? We talk about getting engaged soon and would hate to get to that point in our relationship and realize it wasn't meant to be. I truly love him and hate that our families do not interact and that my family has issues with him.\n\nA little advice would be wonderful!",

   "selftext": "I\u2019ll give a quick back story. My mother has had a tremendous rough life. She was abused as a child, I\u2019m not exactly sure to what extent but I\u2019m fairly certain sexual abuse was involved. Then she began a relationship with my father who was physically and mentally abusive. As the oldest daughter, I was her protector. She left my father when I was 10-12 years old but her alcoholism took over. I was left to care for my younger siblings, one of which was 9 years younger than me and severely neglected by my mother and has intellectual disabilities. My dad got his life together enough to care for my sister until she was 16 and that\u2019s when I took over guardianship of her. My mom was detached from her so she never had a bond. She was more like an aunt to my younger sister. As you can imagine, my mom is severely depressed and binge drinks for weeks in a dark room covered in vomit. \n\nI knew at an early age I had to get my life together and get out of my situation if I was going to make it out. There\u2019s a long line of alcoholism on both sides and I was determined to not follow suit. I was successful at doing so but that required cutting my parents out of my life and obtaining an \u2018acquaintance\u2019 like relationship. I held bday and holiday gatherings which parents would attend sober and non combative because I held zero tolerance for it and it was really nice to witness after so many years of having all holidays ruined. All 3 of my mother\u2019s children are free of alcoholism and none of us drink alcohol but I feel like that also came at a price because we had to distance ourselves and decided We will not be codependent or supportive to the disease. I knew I made the right decision when a few years ago my mom would come visit my sister to try to build on their relationship and I discovered she was stealing her prescription medication. \n\nMy mom currently lives with her sister who is an addict herself but bc it\u2019s prescription medication it\u2019s not addiction. She enables my mom and buys her alcohol. My mom has  always refused treatment or any kind of mental help. She does attend AA meetings and church but it\u2019s too severe to not seek professional help. However, with so many years of doing this she has recently taken a turn for the worse and it\u2019s almost like she is trying to kill herself by alcohol. My aunt called my hysterical that she doesn\u2019t know what to do and she is coming home to her covered in her own vomit and has not had food or water in days. She called the ambulance yesterday because my moms lips were blue. \n\nThis is what I need your help with, do I write her, call her, do nothing? You are the only one that can imagine the despair my mother feels and I\u2019m conflicted if I reach out to her at this point it will just send her over the edge. I feel like Im a trigger bc of the tremendous amount of guilt that  she couldn\u2019t do better for us and I\u2019m caring for my sister. I have never thrown that in her face bc I know how bad it hurts her that she failed us and I don\u2019t want her to carry that kind of guilt, although I\u2019m very aware the guilt is there. She\u2019s always been closed off and taught us no crying is allowed or emotions should be shown but I want to reach out to her but I\u2019m not sure what to say. I ask myself, if she dies today what would I want to say but there\u2019s so much and some things I will never say to her bc I don\u2019t want to hurt her. I want to tell her, your kids made it, we are ok, we are waiting for you, to join us and be apart of your grandchildren\u2019s lives, no questions asked. I want to share my motherhood stories with her. I want to tell her how amazing her grandson is and how great he is at baseball. I want to tell her that her granddaughter is so beautiful is almost ready to crawl. There\u2019s just so much I\u2019ve wanted to share with her and I\u2019m afraid I will never get the chance. I was my mother\u2019s protector, even in the darkest time, I stood up for her. Until one day I had to walk away.... now the time is nearly gone and I don\u2019t know the words to say to her. \n\nIf you took the time to read this, I greatly appreciate it. Please continue with your sobriety. \n",

I put on about 60 pounds(went up to 250) from drinking, consuming 2000-3000 calories most days from sugary alcoholic beverages alone, plus unhealthy eating, and laziness.  I have been much more active, taking the 30 minute walks I used to take a 40 minute bus ride to avoid, and going to the gym.  But the biggest factor is definitely the 2000-3000 cut in daily calories, and I am down 20 pounds!!\n  \nI have also been going to daily AA/NA meetings, one of each for 2 meetings most days, counselling, r/stopdrinking, combined with physical activity, healthy(healthier at least, ive been allowong some treats, as it is much better than drinking and helps stay motivated) eating, and vitamins.  I have no desire to drink now, don't even think about It, and have no temptations walking past the liquor store.\n  \nI am actively working to beat this disease, and it is so much more than just \"not drinking\"  which explains why I couldn't go more than 1-3 days before.\n  \nAnyhow this is now getting too long, so I'll end it here, and \n  \nI Will \"Not Drink\" With You Today\n  \nAnd\n  \n\"One Day At A Time, Progress Not Perfection\" for anyone getting started or thinking of doing so.\n \n\n(I used to think these posts were kinda cheesy when I was in active addiction, but if that's true I'm proud to be cheesy)",

   "selftext": "I don't think I have been/am physically dependent on alcohol: Usually after day 3 or 4 of drinking, the amount I need to feel normal is too much so I just stop for a few days.  I very rarely drink two days in a row.\nHowever I get severe cravings. This is usually in the build up to social situations. I definitely have psychological dependence on alcohol. Also I watched a documentary recently with a young alcoholic who ran out of his rehab because he just needed to 'feel that shot of vodka washing down his throat'. i can totally relate to that...the sense of relief when I drink spirits.\nSometimes I also drink about 100ml when I know I have something tough at work. (ie being under scrutiny when I have to perform). I drink to prepare and then i just get on with my day.\nIf I drink socially then I usually drink 200-400ml of vodka or whisky in an evening. However this is just about once a week.\nWhen I was in my early twenties I could go to the pub and have a couple of pints and then go home easily as with my friends. Now I am mid thirties and generally experience severe cravings after the equivalent of this amount.\n\nRecently I went to a pub with some friends and our kids for lunch. They knew I drove so I decided I wasn't going to have more than 2 pints over a few hours. However after the two pints I walked out of the pub a couple of times to see if I could find a local shop selling vodka that I could neck down without people knowing. It was only because I couldn't see one close by enough that I went back in to the pub, but the cravings were there and ruined the whole experience.\n\nThe next day (day before yesterday) I went to a party and blacked out. I also fell off my cycle and bruised my ribs by falling down, which will take 5 weeks to heal. I did the same thing about 2 months ago and means I can't really exercise in the first 2 or 3 weeks.\n I don't drink when I don't go out unless I am unhappy about something but not more than an evening or two.\nMy question is: Since I do not have physical dependency, do you think I should try and tackle with moderation, or do you think teetotal is appropriate? I found the cravings I experienced in the pub much worse than when I quit smoking...(successfully about 2 years ago). ",

He has struggled with alcoholism for the two years that we\u2019ve been together, and I\u2019m under the impression he\u2019s struggled with it for most of his life. He has been in a medication assisted recovery program for the past few months. Last night, he relapsed and got argumentative with me. It quickly escalated into violence... he punched me repeatedly in the face, wrapped his hand around my throat and beat my head against the wall, and threw me into our tv stand. I called the police and they arrived relatively quickly and took him into custody, and informed me that they would be pressing charges. \n\nToday, I looked at the charges and they include a second degree felony of strangulation which could carry up to 10 years imprisonment. It\u2019s almost certainly wrong to feel this way, but I don\u2019t want him to face that charge.

   "selftext": "I wish I even knew how to start.  I'm just lost.  A year ago I found some FB messages between my spouse and another person.  I have been married over a decade.  I thought things were okay, even though we've struggled with keeping the \"romance alive\".  We have kids.  I have never snooped through anything before, and in total honesty, I happened to need to look up something on a laptop, and theirs was sitting right there on the desk, so I opened a browser, and they had left FB open.  Then a message notification popped up.  Something along the lines of \"I'll call you later, baby\".  I couldn't help it.  I had to look.  \n\nWhat I found was months of messages back and forth between my spouse and this person.  Things like \"maybe one day we'll have our 'happily ever after'\", and \"I love you more than anything else\".  There was even a moment where my spouse mocked me because I was sick, saying that I was not holding my own, and that I must be faking it because I was fine just a few hours before.  \n\nThis part hurt the most.  My spouse has several health issues, and I try to be strong so that they don't have to worry about anything when they are having an attack.  I rarely show that I'm sick.  This time, I could barely stand up and was shivering so much I couldn't bear it.  For once I let myself be vulnerable and let them take care of me.  Then I find out that they hated and mocked me for it.  \n\nI left the house.  They called me and said I should come home before the \"pills kicked in\".  I caved.  I went back, and after a few days, pretended like it never happened.  After a while, my spouse started going out with friends.  Then just one friend.  Then staying out so late that I would get a text \"I'm too tired to drive, so I'll just stay here\".\n\nI'm the one that stays home with the kids when they are out doing whatever they want.  If we have a home cooked meal, it's because I cooked it.  They will put a load of laundry in the washer at 10pm, then go to bed and ask me to make sure it gets put in the dryer.  \n\nWe both work.  We both have full time careers at a professional level.  \n\nIt's been going downhill more and more.  I can't even get to sleep anymore without taking a sleeping pill and a whiskey chaser.  This past weekend was my birthday.  What did we do?  Got a sitter to go out to eat on Friday night and a movie.  Then Saturday night, they were supposed to go to a college party that this \"friend\" was invited to, but stayed up too late at this friend's house eating food and watching movies. I get a text at 2am that my spouse is too tired to drive.\n\nI'm done, but I don't know how to be done.  My spouse sends me these long messages declaring their love for me, and that I'm the best thing that ever happened, and that they couldn't live without me.  I guess that doesn't include Saturday nights, or FB friends who they declare their undying love to, or when I'm sick.  \n\nI'm so lost.  I don't even know which way is up anymore.  I wish I would get hit by a drunk driver so that I could be out of my misery.\n\nI can't leave, but I can't stay.  Everyone looking at us sees the perfect family, because I keep up the facade.  I cover up for them.  I lie about where they are when someone asks, or lie about how happy I am, when all I want to do is fade away.  Once I got so tired of dealing with it that I got drunk at home.  The kids were asleep, I was just there with my bottle of wine and whiskey.  I was smashed.  I had to grab the trash bin to throw up.  I wasn't violent, I didn't even argue with them.  I just got drunk and threw up.  But that gets brought up like I've brought the devil himself into our home.  I'm sure that little tidbit was passed around their family:  \"ooooh.  Careful.  Artifex is a budding alcoholic\".  \n\n\nI have no one else to tell, so here I am, making an anonymous post on Reddit, hoping they don't see it and get mad at me for spilling the beans.  \n\nI don't know how much more I can take.\n",

I want to be involved in this community, so I suppose nows as good a time as any!\n\nI've known I had a problem with alcohol for years. I've tried moderation, breaks, you know the drill. Last year I did Sober October and kept talking about how great it was and how much better I felt, but of course I drank EVERY DAY from November 1st to December 31st.\n\nI decided to finally do something about it to better myself, made the decision sometime in early December but kept drinking right up until New Years. I knew it would be challenging to do a year without alcohol, but I figured it would give me enough of a break to learn how to drink in moderation....\n\nWell, it's been a million times easier than I imagined, and I've grown and learned SO MUCH in the last few months. I still struggle with the idea of never drinking again, but I'm becoming more and more comfortable with it every day. I knew I needed to give myself a year, but I didn't know at the time that I needed the year to really reevaluate my relationship with alcohol. I kind of thought I would be white knuckling it a ton and counting down the days. At this point, however, I already know I will not be drinking January 1st.\n\nI know we all struggle with our \"alcoholic brain\" (I like \"party goblin\" - Iliza Shlesinger) that tries to convince us moderation is possible. I'm slowly starting to accept that it's not. But I really truly feel like giving myself a year hard deadline with absolutely no alcohol was the best thing I could ever do for myself. I knew that if I said it and wrote it down, I could do it no problem. I didn't anticipate that I'd be doing so much reflection. I didn't anticipate that I would ever be comfortable and happy not drinking.\n\nI'm scared that the party goblin will win one of these days, but I know I've got a handle on it for the next 7 months, and I know I'll come here first when she starts getting loud in 2019, 2020, whenever it ends up being.\n\n\nTL; DR: My new years resolution is the only thing that made sobriety seem possible.

My father is a highly successful example of this. I love him to pieces and we usually drink heavily together. He lives about a 25 hour drive away so we don't see each other often but talk weekly. I have told my mom about quitting booze but not dad, yet. \n\n\nI know deep down he will probably be supportive, but another part of me is kind of worried he will blow it off or tell me he doesn't think I have a problem. I mean, worse things could happen but I would like him to be happy for me or validate my feelings, too. We will just have to wait and see. I feel ready to share this with him now and that's enough. Plus, I'd be a fool to think this won't change our relationship at least a little. I'm noticing that I may lose a few friends over this, or at least a closeness we had when drinking.

I was a loser for most of my life up until I was 15 when I moved to a school where I met actual friends and actually got a girlfriend that I fell in love with. But I was an idiot and got kicked out of that school. And then the next one after that. Wasn\u2019t even there for a week. Parents refused to take me back. Well, my dad. Forgot to mention that at this point my mother was a dysfunctional alcoholic who had her kids taken from her and spent all her days passed out drunk on the couch in our old living room. Parents getting divorced really fucked me up when I was a kid too. Happened during the summer, and I remember first person I told on my first day at school called me a loser for it. Whaddya know. A lot of negativity in the past but I wanna make this about the present. Now, I haven\u2019t been able to get over that same girl from 3 fucking years ago and it\u2019s pathetic. Had something close to one but lost it for reasons I don\u2019t understand and can\u2019t explain. (Got ghosted). I live with my mom who has recovered from alcoholism but hasn\u2019t recovered from everything else. My apartment is a fucking disaster and I can\u2019t clean it because my mom won\u2019t let me. I\u2019m at the beginning stages of addiction/ already addicted to drugs, but I can\u2019t stop using because I just don\u2019t care anymore. I have friends, but most are hollow shells of people that only care about themselves, and the ones that aren\u2019t only want to hang out so they can get high with me. My mom has the same argument with me every month, topic could be anything outcome is the same, and tries to kick me out then 2 days later says I don\u2019t have to leave and asks me to come back. I would be gone but I have no where else to go. Now my mom in what I assume was an attempt to help me stole some of my pills to get them \u201ctested\u201d. However they were not illegal drugs and instead medication that was prescribed to me. When I confronted her, I was told to leave the house. (Haven\u2019t left yet). Then I was blamed for her crippling mental condition. Other things I\u2019ve been blamed for my all of my parental figures (step or biological) include: failure of marriage, financial issues, alcoholism, failures of other siblings, etc. I can\u2019t hold a job because I am constantly being dragged along by the Security company I work for that doesn\u2019t want to give me a paying position. Sometimes I wish I could just die, but I\u2019m too much of a p*ssy to kill myself, which I guess is a good thing. The only hope I have is a slim possibility that in 2 months I can move to a completely different state (with an old friend and one of the only real ones I have left) and start over from scratch. If I don\u2019t I have no clue what will happen\n\nI\u2019m not looking for pity. Just wanted to get this off my chest. There are always two sides to every story and I\u2019m sure I look like an evil guy on the other side. This is  just my perspective of my life, and yes it is greatly negative, but it is how I perceive it.",

   "selftext": "3 weeks and.....damn, my life is soooo much better! I actually like myself again--and after spending years loathing myself because I couldn't \"moderate\" my drinking, it is such a gift to look in the mirror and be proud of the person I see looking back at me (the fact that my face is no longer a puffy mess is a nice bonus ;)\n\nStrange, but it is starting to seem like my drinking self is a fuzzy memory--like it was me, but it wasn't me at all. I was slogging through my life as a shell of myself, using only a fraction of my talents (and brain cells), settling for second best, and watching my life slide by. I was observing my life move on by through a booze soaked inertia. Yuck! Fuck that. Never, ever, ever fucking going back there again. I can't even believe that was me...So grateful that I get a second chance to finally enjoy my amazing life with a clear mind, a willing heart, and with some joy! Yes, joy! \n\nNow to the hard part: Getting here wasn't simple (it cost me to get where I was), but in a way, once it became obvious to me HOW I had gotten myself into such a state (chemical dependency caused by alcohol), and WHY I had been unable to quit before (unconscious programming), it was actually pretty easy and a true joy to quit drinking. Really. I am not kidding you. Once I GOT IT, there was just no going back. I have lost my desire to drink. I won't pretend that thoughts about drinking haven't popped up--they have. What's different now is I can SEE those thoughts for what they are--subconscious desires that I can choose to allow to dictate my choices, or ones that I am in full power to choose to reject. And then I reject the thoughts. I'm able to examine where the thought is coming from (my subconscious) and why it is appearing (usually because I'm feeling anxiety about something and the Bad Idea Department is suggesting that I'll feel less anxious if I booze it up). I KNOW now (really know) that there is no way in the Seven Levels of Hell that alcohol will make any situation any better--It won't make me less anxious (in fact I will wake up later in a cold sweat with a panic atttack); It won't make me smarter (I will just sound stupid if I drink); It won't make me more attractive (hello 45 lbs that I gained--thanks Pinot Grigio!); It won't make me wealthier (see my last post about how I wasted $150,000 on booze and realted BS in the last 10 years); It won't make me more popular (people liked me Despite my boozing--NOT because of it). In short, there is nothing that alcohol was adding/will add to my life. I truly know that now. \n\nJust to test myself I took a sip of wine from a glass that I poured for a friend who was over for dinner last week. Nasty. Tasted like vinegar. Proved to me that there was nothing that I actually liked about the taste of wine--rather I had just liked (or rather Thought I liked) getting hammered, and had convinced myself that I actually liked drinking vinegar poison water. Now--it just tastes Nasty. Fucking Nasty. I look at wine and vodka bottles and I see liquid misery. I see fat. I see wasted resources. I see bottles of shame leading to oceans of regret and remorse. No Thank You. I'm done.\n\nThank you to everyone here for sharing your stories--you have all helped me in my resolve to never let booze have a place in my life again.\n\nWishing you all the best and, I Will NOT Drink With You Today (or any other day). \n\nTo anyone Lurking: You CAN do this--yes YOU! I know you can. Put your toes in the water, hell, dive in. The sober water will be the best swim of your life.\n\nPS: The books \"This Naked Mind\" and \"Alcohol Explained\" are wonderful resources--if you haven't read them I HIGHLY recommend picking them up.",

   "selftext": "It was hard for me to quit drinking because I thought to quit meant I had to have the label of, alcoholic for the rest of my life. I knew I drank too much but I never had a rock bottom experience. I was afraid the other people who had quit would somehow look down on me for not being a real alcoholic. I was once having a conversation with a person active in AA and he said some folks say if you can go spend $20 in a bar and then go home, you aren\u2019t an alcoholic. Well I could do that, but I knew I had a problem. \n\nI came to this sub and did my, I need to quit post. Someone saw it and gave me an equation that resonated with me. Alcohol + Me = Undesirable Consequences. Boy is that the truth! So that gave me a way of thinking about my relationship with alcohol without putting a label in myself and it is what I needed. \n\nAnother person suggested I read, This Naked Mind, by Annie Grace. The book uses linguistic techniques to change the way the reader thinks about alcohol. The book works to remove the psychological addiction the reader has to alcohol. It really worked for me. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the only way to become sober and I realize I am still addicted to alcohol and that there is no place for alcohol in my life, it is simply the way that worked for me. I hope it can work for someone else too. \n\nIWNDWYT ",

Mind you that was mostly just in afternoons and evenings. Because I work really early in the morning. \n\nI\u2019m not the typical drunk. I don\u2019t black out, I don\u2019t get violent, I just don\u2019t like it anymore. I recently have been cutting back over the past few months but since I have a heart condition I can\u2019t take the risk of going cold turkey. I talked to my doctor and he said that he could totally give me medication if I needed but I would prefer not to go that route. So I took the plunge and decided I\u2019m doing it once and for all. \n\nSo I bought a bottle of whiskey, took water bottles, dumped out enough of the water to put the correct amount of whiskey in. Kinda like a meal prep for drunks that don\u2019t want withdrawals. I did it for 7 days. Which was probably way longer than needed but I had almost no symptoms of withdrawal. Mind you it was really hard to stick to but I had my roommate lock the bottles up and give me my portions for the day. And tomorrow\u2019s day one with zero! \n\nDisclaimer: Obviously medically detoxing with the help of a professional is technically way safer. So I\u2019m not saying I recommend it but it seems to have been working. ",

   "selftext": "I've struggled my whole life with mental health, I was barely able to pass any classes or show up to school due to severe anxiety and depression.When I first started working, I would sometimes leave my shift or just never show up because my mind was all over the place. I finally came across a doctor that diagnosed me with an anxiety disorder, was prescribed prozac which kept me stable enough to work and to start going back to school.\nI went through a really abusive, psychotic break up a year and a half ago and used alcohol to cope with it. I've drank since I was 16 but always had control and never blacked out or did anything stupid up until recently. I always had control and was always the voice of reason to those around me that were wasted.\n\nSomething in me was triggered, as all my anxiety and depression came back stronger and heavier then ever. Drinking became my go to when I couldn't handle the anxiety and the voices is in my head. My moods started shifting from being very anxious to very angry to very depressed to extremely happy within hours, I used alcohol to calm those moods and eventually added xanax to the mix to put me in a sleepy, calm state.. My doctor prescribed me bipolar medication and bumped up my prozac, but nothing has helped. My doctor told me that my medicine won't fully work until I quit drinking, but for the life of me I can't stop. The nights I sleep sober I wake up every hour and have nightmares. As soon as I wake up I'm filled with anxiety and depressed thoughts that drive me to drink. When I don't drink I'll take xanax to calm me down and sometimes even mix the two. I know its dangerous, and I know I'm making my mental health issues worse but I still can't stop.\n\nI've gained 15 pounds in the last year.\nI dropped out of school because I couldn't stay sober for class.\nMy work ethic has dropped and I started working less and calling out due to being depressed and hungover.\nI wrecked my car while blacked out on alcohol and xanax.\nI lost my phone a few days ago from blacking out.\nI committed a felony while shit faced but luckily wasn't charged.\nI stopped making new music with my band and let my band mates down.\nI stopped taking care of myself,my hygiene, my room and car are always a mess.\nI've completely lost interest in anything that doesn't have to do with drinking.\nMy therapist and close friends have gotten sick of me complaining about the same problems.\n\n\n\n\nYet, drinking seems to be a big part of me that I can't seem to get away from. All my friends,family, and coworkers drink. My work is surrounded by alcohol and alcohol tastings. People only wanna hang out with me when there is alcohol involved, I have nothing to talk to with people because all I cared about for the past year is drinking. Music was my passion, but if I go to a show, alcohol is always there.  giving up alcohol means giving up the very few things that keep me from going insane and being alone.\n\nI don't know what I'm trying to say...I'm tired of feeling so shitty and trapped lost from all this crap, I don't know if its the alcohol or my mental health that's making me destructive. I'm falling deeper into a hole that I feel like I'll never crawl out of. At times I'm convinced the alcohol and xanax help me through the suicidal thoughts I get. I absolutely hate myself physically and I hate who I am as a person. As much as I try to reach out to people about how I feel, no one seems to get it or understand and just tell me that I'm being dramatic.\nI want help. I want to be clean and happy again but I can't seem to do it on my own. \n\n",

   "selftext": "They say that the buzz from alcohol in general lasts around 20 minutes, after that you just get numb and eventually drunk (and do stupid things). While you might not feel anxious while being numb or drunk, you are not particularly happy either, you are just like a zombie - just existing, breathing. Is that what life is supposed to be like? NO!\n\n\nAnd for this, 20 minutes of (artificially) feeling good, or being like a zombie, this is what we got in return (daily drinking):\n\n- Horrible hangovers, waking up feeling miserable everyday, sweaty - shaking with anxiety. \n\n- Generally feeling like shit and anxious most hours of the days = basically feeling like shit most time of your life.\n\n- Blackouts. Isn't this one of the most creepy things ever? To be awake and do stupid things, while basically being unconscious, remembering nothing. Scary stuff. \n\n- Intense morning shame/regret. \"What stupid things did I do/say yesterday?\" \"Who did I text? Oh fuck not again...\"\n\n- Daily anxiety, panic attacks and depression, that just gets worse and worse as you keep drinking.\n\n- Drunk fights/arguments with your SO, being an ass to your family and beloved ones. Hitting your beloved ones. \n\n- Being a bad father/mother...\n\n- Broken promises, people around you stop believing in you. You become a dirty liar, and in many people's eyes you will always be one even if you stop drinking. \"That guy is really unreliable\".  \n\n- Permanent ruined relationships/friendships. Being an ass to everyone, lying to everyone. \n\n- Getting fired from work.\n\n- Trips to ER, being close to die. \n\n- DUI.\n\n- Daily shame and guilt for hiding cans and bottles. The shame of trying to \"act sober\".\n\n- Having to drink just to be able to go to the supermarket without freaking out with a panic attack. \n\n- Bad eating habits, bloated belly. Your body feels so heavy and tired, extremely lethargic. \n\n- Generally lack of energy and motivation. Not performing well at work.\n\n- Lack of happiness. Things you used to enjoy (hobbies) are not fun anymore. You never feel happy or hyped about something unless you are intoxicated. Dreams and ambitions are long gone. You become an empty shell.\n\n- Constantly being negative and easily getting irritated. \n\n- Scarily high Blood Pressure and other health dangers that can lead to death.\n\n- Suicidal thoughts. \n\nWell, I am sure not all of these apply to everyone, but these are some of mine and I am sure some of you can relate... AND ALL OF THIS, for 20 minutes of artificial buzz (which even almost is as relaxing as the buzz after working out)? Isn't it insane when you think about it? What the hell were we doing my friends? \n\nI will not drink with you today!!!!!! IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!!!",

   "selftext": "recently my family's german shepherd died in a freak accident. He had just turned 1. It still doesn't feel real. I had such a strong bond with him. I was away at school and they didn't tell me until I came home last friday, and my mom had already gone and got a new puppy that same day I came home. \n\nShe told me they bought him from a breeder in Missouri and the breeder had him shipped by plane. Today things my mom said started adding up. \"Oh they didn't even make me sign papers to not breed him or get him fixed weird huh\" \"when we brought him home and put him in the yard it was like he'd never seen grass before\" and the fact that they shipped him by plane, didn't care they didn't know anything about my family, no info about his parents, he was way cheaper than other dogs my family has gotten, he is fine with our other dog but reacts weird to people and being petted, and on top of all this the puppy is extremely skinny. He's fluffy so it's hard to tell visually but you can feel all his bones. he's 14 weeks old so I feel like he should still have baby fat\n\nalso my mom lied to me, I was telling he how weird it was that they would ship him by plane and she was like \"oh well they didn't want to ship him but we paid extra\" I looked at their website. They ONLY ship puppies. They had no other information, no pictures of facility, nothing human. Just a few different random breeds of 8 week old puppies for sale\n\n\n\nI don't know what to do. I guess there is nothing but I am just so grossed out my mom would support something that is probably awful just to have a cute puppy immediately\n\nshe keeps getting mad at me because I don't care about the new puppy but I am still processing everything that's happened and now with this I don't know how to feel, the whole thing just makes me so uncomfortable\n\nI can't talk to her about it, she is an alcoholic and kind of emotionally unstable, I'm honestly scared if I do she might end up hurting the new puppy. It's always been like this, if I ever suggest getting a dog from a shelter she gets really mad and yells at me. She just wants cute babies and stops caring about them when they grow up or she gets bored\n\n",

   "selftext": "This is a long, long venting session, read if you want. It\u2019s basically just one big journal entry of memories and thoughts that have run through my mind today. I posted just in case anyone can relate to anything which is sometimes helpful. I occasionally talk about Alexithymia since originally this post was memories of mine trying to figure out if that is what is wrong with my mother, it was not all edited out so just ignore it if you see it.\n\nI\u2019m going to start with a description of everyone in my house for the context of these accounts of my life:\n\nMe, I\u2019ll go by anon if I ever reference myself in 3rd person. I\u2019m a 17 year old girl, I don\u2019t know that my looks are important to the stories I tell below but I\u2019m not willing to read to find out since I can\u2019t remember what most of them even talk about. I\u2019m skinny and small, white as hell, blonde hair, blue eyes, you get it. I think I\u2019m an ass, lets get that off the bat. I\u2019m a very bitchy and moody person but I have been for a long, long time, I am currently finishing up Grade 12/Senior year of high school. I live in Canada and will be moving to another province in order to study Computer Science at University next year. I do not like my family, except my sister. Not heavily addicted but I do use a lot of uppers, particularly meth, I generally only use it when I am at school or have a big test though I only really did get into these bad habits after pretty much all the events that take place in the following stories. \n\nMy mother is a workaholic, money focused woman. She is also very rude and judgmental. She definitely does think she is flawless though, that's why I believed she was a narcissist. She is a completely different person in public than behind closed doors and her bad parenting will probably forever go unknown to the people around her. Don\u2019t know if she is a full alcoholic but she is real close. I wrote up some memories of mine that I hope someone can relate to on this sub.\n\nMy father, a narcissist to the extreme. A minister who does not act like one, this includes funerals and weddings that he directed, more funerals than weddings. Also a padre in the military, that means he doesn\u2019t do any actual combat, high activity, major business, he was basically a counselor without the training who chats, buys drinks for everyone at the unit, and goes to parties and gatherings with them. He has Parkinson's Disease and is an asshole, whether those two things have any connection I don\u2019t know but since Parkinson\u2019s is caused by Dopamine deficiencies in the brain I think there is some kind of connection. He also has heart disease and I would be shocked if he didn\u2019t get diabetes soon. Also, with a large part of his career since my childhood being funeral direction he has made the topic rather lenient in my head and I wholeheartedly believe he will die in the next few years of health complications, I don\u2019t say that to be rude or ominous, I\u2019ve spent my entire life with pre and post funerals and there are just some signs you start to see in people close to that door. He has done many bad things and probably many more I don\u2019t know of. I learned my addictive behaviours from him. Any trait of a narcissistic parent or narcissist in general can describe him so I won\u2019t write it here.\n\n\nMy sister, older than me by exactly two and a half years to the day, I care for her a lot. There are many, many things she doesn\u2019t know about the family she grew up with though. She is honestly pretty dumb but not to a bad extent where it will negatively impact her life, more just bad coping and comprehension skills. She was very sheltered from harsh realities and therefore is unable to face them now like the adult she should be. Though well into university in our hometown she still seems to only concern herself with petty high school drama in her social group. I am unsure how she will ever handle life, simple tasks she cannot and will not do, at age 20 she should not assign me with the task of mailing something for her because she is scared and doesn\u2019t know how.\n\n\n\n* note for the following accounts, a general understanding of my relationship with my family in my few years of high school. The biggest and most important pitchfork in the heart of this family was when I tried to open up about some abusive behaviour they had as I was growing up, not mentioned in this post. Since our family had a public image to uphold for several reasons, it was very bad that some of the abuse I wanted to discuss had the possibility of hurting their reputation. The solution was isolation from me, I was fine with that. An agreement was made that I would live separately from my three other family members in a separate area of the home since moving out would make bad publicity, they would also show up to special events so as to look normal. I found being away from them was good for me but I was lonely, I think I was too young to be independent. I made things work, I made ends meet, sometimes in ways I am not proud of. \nI did so much for the house before we had that strong divide, not only because I was the makeshift man of the house but also circumstances described in #5 of my examples as well as my general personality which was not similar enough to theirs. I was the only non religious member of the house, I did not like their fancy wine parties for the military friends and family and I definitely did not like church gatherings of any sort, but most of all they were displeased with the interests and activities I enjoyed. Once in high school I found I had real talent and enjoyment in sciences and maths, especially computer science which I always completed with 100% in for each year I had taken it. My father, not only a graduated minister but a degree in history and a nearly abandoned passion for music. My sister, an interest in english, she begins university going for a Journalism but switched to English which she is currently still studying. My mother, political science and has worked many government based strategic planning jobs. When I was very young it was the Ministry of Health, eventually moving to the more prominent Ministry of Education. They were all very creative types, they all enjoyed literature and the concept of making something. That was not me at all, I liked fact and having one right answer. I was not a genius by any means but I as willing to put in the work to study and learn as much as I could. That was until they all chipped away at my passion for these things. The amount of times I had been mocked in social gatherings, told by their peers that I don't look like the science type, or that I will likely never succeed greatly surpasses whatever positive comments I try to force in my brain. I was very isolated in our family unit, to a point where I lived on a seperate level of the house and lived alone with little to no contact with them.\n\n\n\n1. The main reason why I thought my mother had Alexithymia is because she seems unable to comprehend emotions to any extent. Even when it comes to physical pain as my sister and I were never allowed to see medical professionals since she had and attitude of \"if I can see the bone then suck it up\". An example of that would be my sister who in the ninth grade injured her ankle in Physical Education. No doctors allowed though, what a mistake that was. Leaving it got her ankle to a point where it will never be normal again. I couldn't tell the specifics but I know her tendon was almost completely severed. She claims it's due to being raised on a farm where there are no doctors around, even so I feel like there would be a little more concern after 3 weeks of her favourite daughter having a black and purple swollen ankle and calf.\n\n\n2. More on medical professionals. I've had mental health issues my entire life, not that I ever talked about to anyone about it before, that wasn't how I was taught to deal with things. Keep it in and deal alone, I'm sure someone will see the very military mindset there, we were a military family after all. After going against her will to get to a doctor, the doctor recommended counseling. My mother agreed right away as I assume she wanted to look like the ideal mother to our family doctor. Behind closed doors she was not pleased. I was told many times that I shouldn't be going to counseling, it is a waste of money insurance or not, and I had nothing to talk about anyways. Counseling around my mother was counterproductive. Every visit meant me being told my feelings are incorrect. As an example, if she got mad she would threaten to kill our house dog, I told her that's was somewhat stressful and I was met with a strict \"well that shouldn't stress you out\". Eventually her words got to me and I stopped attending counseling, I did get a new counselor in late high school. It was an on school grounds counselor, very lovely woman and intelligent though I found I was never able to tell her anything that actually wore on my mind. I didn't really trust adults, can't say I didn't know why.\n\n\n3. It is almost as if she never learned what happy, sad, or angry faces are and always seems to use them at improper times. Any kindergartner could point to cartoony faces and tell you that the smiling one is happy, I suppose my mother never got that lesson. She has no regard for others feelings. I can recall getting up for school one morning as she turned to me, out on this weird fake smile and said \"Chris died this morning\". Chris being a fake name for a close family friend who had been an important part of my life until that point. I didn't react much as our house had a no crying ideology for the men. I am not a man and never was, I'm a very feminine looking girl but I'm the closest thing to a son the family had. I was treated as the son being the younger of the two siblings since my older sister took the female child role, I had to pick up for the lack of a boy in the house. Even with my lack of proper emotion I cannot comprehend how she had such a disturbingly normal face on, like she had just told me she was making a cup of coffee for herself.\n\n\n\n4. My mother and father, are a divorced couple that\u2019s married. In my almost 18 years of life having two parents I haven\u2019t seen them kiss, hug, share a room, or show genuine kindness to one another. They do not love each other, I know because I have discussed it with them. My sister dislikes the state of our parents marriage, after we had a long talk I was bringing what she wanted to say to them since she didn\u2019t want to do it herself. I felt like a parent nagging my two children. Each one of them vented about the other to me, just another reason I didn\u2019t like the environment this family made. If I wanted the he said she said I would just spend more time at school. I don\u2019t think sitting your own parents down and discussing whether or not they should get a divorce is on many people\u2019s to do lists for age 17 but I was willing to give them one last shot for my sister. If you are trying at all to follow these stories chronologically I apologize. This is after the major shift in the family dynamic happened. My parents and I are still not close, we have a first name basis. We are really no more than house mates and me being little more than the strange tennant living below them. Either way, they raised me and it is still my business. I asked them why they are still together and they put it quite simply, \u201cthe money\u201d. Divorce is expensive, I guess I understand that. Then the most awkward conversation in a long time for my father why asks if I ask this because they don\u2019t sleep together.\n\u2026\nNo, that is not it. I ask because I share a house and occasionally communicate with two idiots who are horrible at pretending they love each other in order to make their oldest daughter happy. I could care less what happens in either of their beds. And really, that is not a comment I wanted or needed to hear from my biological father. Frankly my reasoning was just because this duo had pissed me off with constant arguing and fights for too long, and now the one person they were bullshitting a relationship for is on to them, so they should quit the act. \n\n\n5. For context, my father had open heart surgery in July right after my 10th grade/sophomore year, due to his years of smoking, steroids and who knows what else. Anyways, this is about when my mother cries, and how it is the only crying that matters. When my mom cried we were all supposed to run to her aid. It rarely happened, I can only recall about two times. The most prominent being in a family counseling session. Now November (Grade 11) and I was growing increasingly frustrated with the growing distress of the house, to the point where I avoided it all together, even spending nights on the streets. Of the \u201cman\u201d of the house I called everyone to family counseling in order to sort things out before they got worse. My sister bailed but she always was allowed to do whatever she wanted whenever she wanted, claimed she \"didn\u2019t like conflict\" and gave me her whole list of things to discuss while she did who knows with her friends, avoiding all the unfunny parts of conflict resolution. The biggest topic being stress in our home, the place was toxic. That heart surgery was a real turning point for me, revealing why exactly I wasn't nor had never been very happy and my parents were largely to blame. I was a servant/slave to my father at home and a nice looking doll for public gatherings for 16 years at this point and only then did I notice. I bring this up in the meeting, not phrasing it like that of course, and giving solid examples. This is why I'd spent quite a few months with no association with my whole family. Then I talked to my mother, I bring up concerns I had with her, little things like how I can't recall any childhood memories with her and the fact that she is ungrateful for any and all things I've worked for for this family. She spends the next while completely trashing both myself and her husband. Now I think my father is an asshole but at least have a purpose for what you're saying, you\u2019d think she'd know that as a strategic planner for the government. She did nothing but describe us as a walking war zone. That may not seem big but it was to me, I kept these three other people afloat for quite a while at this point all the while trying to keep up with my academics which they didn\u2019t care about since it wasn\u2019t any areas that interested them. someone who had gone through so much trouble, kept the whole house steady on my own at the age of 15-16 since no one else would, I was hurt to find that her emotions were the only ones that seemed to matter, and my sisters of course were brought up. I'd given up my entire life, I had no friends, no freedom, no more reliable work. I did it all for this dictatorship family, manipulated by this one woman who didn\u2019t even realized what she had done. And if I tried to bring it up, I'd get a shrug or a casual pass of the subject. She really did think she was flawless and it seemed that by comparison I was nothing but garbage. All because she cried, and dismissed everyone else\u2019s emotions, she got that moral high ground of not giving a shit about anyone but herself. That hurt quite a bit, after all that I had done for them and yet I became the reason for every flaw in the home.\n\n\n6. This took place the June after the events in #5 so still 16, finishing 11th grade or Junior year for those who call it that. Others crying was what I can only describe as annoyance for my mother, that or frustration I suppose. I never cried, I can only recall two times and only one when she was around. I was sexually assaulted by my boss on my first day of work, (the boss was a woman, important later) and aside from her obligatory \"what were you wearing\" she was just disgusted that I was upset. I can not recall a time when I've really cried since. It was a weak moment for me, I think that was at least a little justified given circumstance. I wasn't going to let it rule my life but I was at a low point. I was 16 and as someone who has never been interested in the idea of sex, having some old woman at your new job have the need to get too personal isn't a real boost in confidence for personal strength, especially when I was supposed to be the tough man of the house now, even though I had no reason to try for them anymore since all my prior efforts didn\u2019t matter since I didn\u2019t . I was still pretty young, with a bad relationship with my entire family even after trying my best to maturely resolve it, and also taking care of the larger responsibilities of the home. This assault happened and all j wanted was sympathy from my mother but I got nothing. I got disgust and a constant checking of her watch to show me just how long I had been wasting her time with my tears. I can't help but feel that mothers are supposed to have that loving instinct and caring nature but I'd never really felt that, especially not in that circumstance.\n\n\n7. I recently found baby videos of me and my sister. Not only did they try to only film my sister, any time I am in the shot they are either getting mad or trying to focus on my sister. I never say anything in any of the videos where I am old enough to. They stopped filming pretty soon after I was born only getting a few clips and snippets when I was old enough to comprehend speech and movement. I\u2019m going to hope it was for camera troubles that made them not film me growing up. \n\n\n8.These are just random thoughts with no purpose but it\u2019s just some things I\u2019m getting off my chest. \n\nAll those fucking ads for kids all about telling a teacher or friend or family member when something is wrong is just bullshit. I really do hate those. It is a bad idea, you have no idea what those people can and will do with that info. Not to mention there is a good chance people will just get uncomfortable around you when they find out you are different than you seemed. \n\nThe stories I typed out are just a few stories of many but these are the ones that came to mind and I still feel like I\u2019m not worthy of complaining because people have had it worse than me. I had been on the streets for a while, I am in the drug trade, I make money in less than great ways but at least I have money right? I want to feel sympathy for myself but I know I don\u2019t deserve it because everyone else has it harder and pity will get me nowhere anyways.\n\nIf you meet someone who needs help, and you get them to open up, and then ditch them in the trash, fuck you. Honestly what the hell? I\u2019ve seen that happen too damn much.\n\nI hate christmas and anyone who pulls that \u201chow can you hate christmas!?\u201d shit just makes me hate it more. I know it\u2019s May but man does that piss me right off.\n\nMy heritage is Russian and Irish and I am proud of it but I feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be. Either way though, ancestors who escaped the Soviets and others who were sent to die on coffin ships, belated thanks, if it weren\u2019t for you I wouldn\u2019t be in this cool ass country ehhhhhh.\n\nI always see suicide as a solution to the most miniscule problems.\n\nI wish I had a real person to vent to but I haven\u2019t got one nor will I ever let myself trust someone to that extend in real life. Not that this reddit isn\u2019t great but I\u2019m sure you all know what I mean.",

You here of guys who are 15+ years sober who relapse into binge drinking, because, as I heard one ex-alcoholic say who was sober for years, \"I'm still an alcoholic I just don't drink\". Would you say its the same with PMO, or do you guys feel like there is no chance you would ever relapse, and the addictive urge is completely out of your system??\n\nThanks  ",

   "selftext": "I've suffered from anxiety for quite some time now I've done CBT, high intensity CBT, hypnotism and meditation. None of it has really helped. I've been with my partner for nearly 6 years and known him for over 10 years. We've had rough patches and split up last year because he thought he fell in love with one of my friends. Turned out he was addicted to heroin and we split up for a few months before ultimately getting back together and I helped him through his addiction. I've had trust issues ever since. Recently my anxiety has been off the scale in regards to our relationship. He's a chef and he works up to 15 hours a day 5 days a week and I get lonely. He does what he can to make me happy and comfortable but sometimes I feel like even the time we do spend together he's not really present. It hit a point last night where I went to bed by myself and instead of asking him or telling him I was anxious I told him I wished he was more affectionate. We've had this conversation multiple times and I end up feeling like I'm in the wrong. He spends 80% of his time at work at I spend 60% of my time at home feeling lonely and the only thing that helps me or stops me feeling anxious is getting drunk. His mum is an ex alcoholic and he hates me drinking. Completely understandable but I don't know what I can do with myself when he's not there and I feel awful. So anyway we had a massive argument last night and he ended up telling me he'd rather be miserable alone than be miserable with me. Pretty fucking shit. I'm on the verge of being fired from my job losing my best friend and fiance and I don't know what to do. He doesn't want to talk to me at the moment which is completely understandable because I've been selfish and want more attention so I don't feel like I'm looking him and he just always wants space. Herein lays the issue. Because of my anxiety when he wants space my head instantly turns to he doesn't want to be with me and instead of being able to just let him have his space my mind runs at a million miles and hour and I get upset and take it out on him. We argue and were both ending up unhappy. What can I do? I need a coping mechanism I need to be able to give him space and I need to learn to make myself happy and calm instead of putting so much pressure on him. I feel fucking awful. And I don't want to lose him and I need to change but I can't find anything that helps. I feel constantly lost and lonely and am anxious 70% of my daily life. I don't want to upset him anymore but I don't want to lose him. I need to fix myself. Please help.",

And most likely, it is. It's easier to have fun when you have some blinders on, right? Alcohol has been my savior. I found that many of my social anxieties vanished when I had a few in me. I made many new friends this way. I am still friends with them. In many ways, alcohol cured me of my inhibitions. So much so, actually, that I really am quite capable going out, being sober, and chatting it up. Yet, for some reason, as I continue my drinking, I find I am drinking more and more. I think that is how the chemical works, you need more and more to have the \"good\" effects. Damn, isn't there a better drug out there? What is hurting me, as I need more of the drug for the same effect, I find the next day harder more difficult.  To put it quite simply, alcohol in the beginning helped me... So much so that I was able to do things, even sober, that I had a hard time doing before. But now, it is becoming a detriment to my life.\n\nAnyway, as I find that any drug can be helpful at first, the increasing dosage and the increasing after effects start to catch up with you.\n\nAnyway, this is kind of rambling and incoherent. What I am asking is my next step. I would like to go out to the local bar and grill, watch a game, chat it up. It would be great to go see a comedy show, and just have non-alcoholic drinks. In fact, I have done this before, with no detriment to my life. A couple of NA beers and a bit of creative trickery, and I was just having as much fun as if I had had the real stuff.\n\nMy goal is to live my life I did before, but replace any alcoholic drink with either a NA beer, or a non-alcohlic drink. Has this worked for anyone here, I think it is quite doable. I say that, because I have actually done it for months at a time, between my stupidity and re-addiction. \n\nI apologize for long rambling here, I was just trying to give my impressions without too much thinking back to edit it.",

I felt there was nothing to look forward to in life. I was accustomed to eagerly awaiting my stiff screwdrivers every day after work.\nAs the days go by, the sadness has been eclipsed by pride. I came clean with drinking friends and my two brother in laws. They were absolutely shocked with my proclamations of alcoholism and now sobriety. There has been a huge convulsion in my social sphere. My relationships with these people are very complex. This would take pages to describe. Suffice it to say, their shock has now turned into envy or perhaps jealousy.

As a young adult, I abused alcohol (luckily, turns out I developed diabetes while sober and now if I try to drink I suffer 8 hour vomiting the next day even after just two beers.)  I moved in with an alcoholic who eventually after years knowing him sexually assaulted me by grabbing my ass.  I'm a straight guy and he was a guy and it was unwanted and unwarranted.  It was just grabbing my ass, so it's not horrific, but it's troubling none the less.\n\nI later worked at a hotel with staff housing.  My room mate was an alcoholic and often got aggressive when drunk.  I was about 20 years younger than him though, so it was just harrassment to deal with though on one occassion he cornered me.  He never had any recollection of it.\n\nNow, I live with another alcoholic.  3 drinks in and he acts like a total asshole that thinks the world revolves around him, and on multiple occassions has physically threatened me.\n\nLast night, I had enough and when he woke up sober I let into him.  Told him to hit me and let him know that I was done taking his abuse.  I told him I'd rather be fucking homeless than live with him because he half asses his way through life and thinks it's a fucking joke.\n\nI'm at the end of my rope here, and I'm not sure what I am looking for here.  I am certainly an alcoholic myself.  If my health allowed me to drink after I stopped being sober I'd be battling my own demons on this more than likely.\n\nWhat do I do?  Do I yet the fuck out of here?  Do I hope the guy on the lease takes action (a 3rd person in this rental has all the responsibility on the lease?)  I know I can't sit here and take this shit anymore.\n\nSo, I turn to people better than him (and me. ) People that beat it, and that now what he is gonna do.  He has not hit rock bottom yet.

She was an alcoholic up until a month and a half ago until she found out and quit cold turkey and went off her meds also. When she was drinking she was constantly kicking me out and then pleading for me to come home. I loved her through it and hoped that now that she\u2019s not drinking I would be able to be stable at home. It wasn\u2019t to be , I got kicked out for consoling her wrong , the next week got kicked out because I asked if she was mad at me and numerous other times for small issues, it seemed like she was a complete different person that just couldn\u2019t stand me. So a week and a half ago after I was kicked out again I had a panic attack and couldn\u2019t do life , I ignored her texts and just couldn\u2019t talk to her for a few days. Then when I did talk to her she made sure I knew what a pile a was and how I\u2019m not the man I told her I was. We have been together about a year and a half and I have not changed. She has painted me black. She ended it tonight because I had contacted her mom and asked for help with her , they had no idea that she drank or was treating me like this. She said we are done because now everyone knows she has issues and it\u2019s my fault and she can\u2019t trust me and she hates me. I love her dearly even knowing she has bpd and is difficult sometimes and have always respected and loved her and and never given her a reason to doubt me until now. It\u2019s almost like she hates me because she hurt me so that makes her mad at me if that makes sense. Also stuck on sex where she thinks the only reason I have stayed is for sex and thinks I lost it because we were not doing it as often which is rediculous . So I am painted extremely black and don\u2019t think she will ever flip back again. Any suggestions that I can do to make her come back and realize how much I did",

I'll never forget those smiles, from the 1st shining one to the last forced one, almost to say \"I've been smiling at you for 2 years why haven't you talked to me?\"  I fell in love with those smiles.

The drunken night to end all drunken nights. \n\nGetting ready for a night out to meet my ex-boss (all good, left on good terms) and some of his friends, I start drinking the 6 bottles of dark beer that are left in the fridge.  My wife has had a stressful week and would rather stay in but she knows that this is potentially a very good networking opportunity for me and so is getting herself ready. The beers are going down well and I start upping the pace in order to finish all 6 before we leave. \n\tWe order an Uber which we actually miss the first time round and end up being charged 5$ (if only that was the only bill this night will bring). Second Uber round, we get to the venue and meet with the people. Everyone seems happy and if having a good time.\n\t\u201cOhh, this place has a large craft beer menu, what should I have to drink? That one looks good \u2013 6.5%. That should get me there nice and quickly.\u201d A few pints down and I\u2019m getting rapidly pissed. Time passes in the bar that sells lots of craft beer and we all have a good time.\n\nMajor error No. 1\nMy wife pulls me aside, \u201cMy darling, let\u2019s go home and call it a night\u201d. Of course that wasn\u2019t going to happen! People were heading to a cocktail bar and so we ended up in the cocktail bar too. \n\nMajor error No. 2\nQuickly getting through those very easy to drink god knows what they were called and then the tequila shots. \n\nMajor error No.3 (from this point on this was all reported back to me by my thank god still wife). \nMy wife drags me vomiting across the road but I\u2019m insisting on returning to the cocktail bar. I walk across the busy street narrowly avoiding getting mowed down by cars (blind drunk by this point). I end up in a pizza takeaway and am apparently spitting on a group of Mexican people. They follow me out and somehow we all find my wife. And so they start spitting in her face as payback for her defending me. At this point the police become involved and my wife begs them not to arrest me. The police tell her that she must get me home immediately. \n\nMajor error No. 4\nI end up pushing my wife in the face.\n\nMajor error No. 5\nI then somehow manage to lose my wife and end up waking up in ER at 7am, drip in arm. \n\nWhen I woke I had absolutely nothing on me including no wedding ring and so started thinking that someone had robbed me along the way. After getting discharged I walked back to where we are staying to find the wife waiting for me. \n\nOf course she has been up all night imagining the worst, petrified at the sound of sirens, sick to the stomach with thoughts of what might be happening. I find my watch, keys and wallet on the counter, but no wedding ring. Of all the things to loose\u2026 the absolute icing on the cake. \n\nThe rock bottom scrape begins, the tears, guilt and absolute depression. Two days later my wife gives me back the ring. \nI feel like something has switched in my brain. I really hope I can stay off it for good this time. \n\nWe are now just very nervous waiting for the ER bill to arrive. \n\nThis isn't the first time something like this has happened but I'm determined for it to be the last. \n\nI will be listening to my wife very closely when she advises me to do things in future \n\nThanks for listening. \n",

   "selftext": "My sister stopped over today, and we got to talking about a social event she invited me to next month \\(mini\\-golf and \"bar hopping\"\\) with her friends. I told her that I'd love to go mini\\-golfing, but then straight up told her that I have a drinking problem. She understood completely and was very caring and supportive of me. It was awesome to just TELL someone and to have them be on your side. \n\nShe also told me she'd tell her friends, who normally would want to get me to drink, that I'm not drinking. Thankfully, her friends are very understanding as well and have been in situations with angry drunk relatives or friends, so they know about alcohol struggles. One of her friends' husbands is friendly with a former alcoholic who is now 10 years sober, so he understands as well. Anyway, they're all mature adults, and my sister assured me that they would be completely supportive. I'm really happy right now.\n\nOn the other hand, while I pledge each day not to drink and pledge to not drink at this event, should I still go? I know some people believe in staying away completely from any event that has drinking until you're able to handle it. But I'd really like to go to a social event since I don't go out much, and I'm confident that the people I'm going with will support me. I believe I will not drink \\(my love for Coke Zero and Diet Dr. Pepper is vastly greater than my 'love' for alcohol\\). \n\nThank you, everyone! IWNDWYT ",

   "selftext": "Ok. So a little over 3 weeks ago Hubby ended our relationship, but I convinced him to give me one more chance. \n\nBack up about 2.5 months before that and he found my new hiding spot in my closet. He checked in my closet and watched me go through about 140 oz of vodka every week for a month, not saying anything, hoping I would quit on my own, but of course I didn't. I came home from a trip, having decided I was going to quit anyway and found a note on one of the empty bottles saying we needed to make a plan to move forward, as in it was over and we were splitting up. Thankfully we didn't.\n\nThose 2 empty bottles are still in my closet with the note on them because I just wasn't able to face them and get rid of them. Today's the day! I'm now just over 3 weeks sober and, although I still have very strong urges to drink, I'm very happy to be sober. I'm sorting all the recycling to take in and I need to get those 2 bottles and get rid of the note. It's weighing on me too much and I'm hoping it'll give me some kind of closure or relief to be rid of those horrible memories that come with thinking about it. I've started this post before I deal with it to give me some courage, then I'll finish the post after I deal with the closet baggage.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI did it!!! I'm all shaky and stuff, but I did it! It wasn't the bottles that were the problem, it was the note from Hubby that hurt so much. I kissed the note, took it outside with me and burned it while singing my new favourite song, \"Sober Up\" by AJR \\(really great song, by the way\\). It felt great! I'm super committed to staying sober for my amazing girls, the love of my life &amp; best friend and for myself! I love myself sober!\n\nThanks for listening and I WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY!!!",

   "selftext": "On Sunday night I posted that I was in a hotel not long after things with my qualifier (husband) had escalated to the point of calling the police so I could get my things out of our house.  \nMany of you replied, telling me to stay strong, that you were proud of me, and I want to truly thank you for being here. This is the hardest thing I've ever done, and while I feel a weight is being lifted off my shoulders, I still get hit with waves of grief, mourning what my life and marriage was supposed to be.  \n  \nNow, for updates:  \nSince I left the hotel the next morning, I went back to my house and gathered several weeks worth of clothes. My husband was even there, and in typical EtOH fashion tried asking if I needed \"help bringing stuff inside\". I told him I was there to bring stuff out to my car, that I was leaving to stay with my parents. He wasn't really surprised, just very sad. He even helped me pack. He let me take our dog, but I left the cats.  \n  \nA very difficult component of my story is that I do not have friends or family in the city we live in, and the alcoholism and relationship problems kept me from developing friendships. So I have to uproot EVERYTHING and come back to my parents', 2 states away.  \n  \n  \nAfter leaving my house with my dog &amp; things, I went to work and talked to my manager. She put me on a leave of absence and I have enough PTO to cover a month away, though she understands I'm not going to come back.  \nDuring the day on Sunday, when I knew that my husband was drinking, I was steaming with anger (still, after 3 years, you'd think my anger would decrease) so I applied for a new job in the city where my parents live.  \nWhile talking to my manager about taking leave, I received a call from the new employer asking if I'd want to interview. I set up a phone interview with HR the next day. That was yesterday and it went well, and now I'm set to interview on site early next week. \n \nI'm very lucky that I chose a field, nursing, that I can uproot my life and have an interview states away within a day. I'm very fortunate that my parents have enough resources to house me again, that they are supportive of me becoming independent again. I'm glad I never had children so that their lives were not destroyed by this also, but I also had to put children on hold because of the alcoholism.  \n  \n  \nI hope this doesn't appear as a wall of text, but I want to let ALL OF YOU know that your words mean so much, your stories are inspiring, your struggles resonate with me, and while I am sorry that we are all driven to this website for one reason or another, I am glad that we have each other.",

I\u2019m 31m and have high blood pressure, have a family history with alcoholism. He prescribed me naltrexone and asked me to take a month off. I tapered for three days before quitting on the first of May. Since then I feel pretty good but the cravings can be hard. I\u2019ve scheduled an appointment with a local organization that deals with substance abuse and provides counseling. For once in my life I have great health insurance due to my awesome new job. One of the reasons I got serious about quitting is cause I know id fuck up this job if I don\u2019t and id fuck up my relationship with my girlfriend and I just know I\u2019d get a DUI at some point if I kept it up. I can\u2019t say how ill feel at the end of the month, I\u2019m hoping I can keep it rolling and just stop for good. I know \u201cmoderation\u201d is really just a myth for people like us, I\u2019ve tried so many times to just moderate only to wake up having no recollection of those \u201c2 or 3 beers\u201d that became a week long bender... I think counseling will help. I\u2019m becoming more and more comfortable with the fact that I\u2019m an alcoholic and that I shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of that I should only be ashamed of it if I allow it to ruin my life fully aware of that knowledge.

I like this group more than r/stopdrinking though because it seems people are trying to do more than just simply not drink today.\n\nToday (more like this week/month) have been tough. Work, personal life, romantic life all seem like they're piling up on me, that there isn't enough time in the day, that my best efforts aren't good enough to break even let alone succeed. I've got about 14 months sober at this point, and I don't feel ask risk of drinking. What I feel is that feeling I used to drink at. I feel like I want to crawl out of my skin. Before getting sober, I didn't realize this feeling is a result of my interpretation of the world, not the actual state of the world. And I am grateful to have that distinction at my disposal now, but it still doesn't cure this feeling.\n\nWhat I do know is taking a drink won't solve this feeling. I checked off so many \"yets\" on my list after my last relapse that I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that taking a drink will not help the situation. That awareness doesn't make this feeling go away, but it does help me put it in context. \n\nTo everyone who reads this going through something like this, you are not alone, this disease is out to get you, drinking won't make the pain go away, it'll just save it (with interest) for you to experience later.",

   "selftext": "Hi guys It's been awhile but I'm feeling retrospective so I wanted to do a post. Last year on my 28th bday is when I first started to think I had a problem. I blacked out I texted my friend that took care of me the next day horribly embarrassed and telling her I thought I had a problem and she talked me off the ledge. A few months after that is when I actively started trying to quit 7 months ago I found this subreddit. I would make it like 20 ish days (or less) then fail again. Even though I thought I had a problem most people would tell me I was being dramatic except my boyfriend he was the one who really noticed. 30/40 ish days for me was the magic number. Once I passed that it's been pretty easy. I wanted to list some things that helped me so maybe if anyone is just starting out here are the things that worked for me.\n\n1. Realizing the Alcohol industry is Bullshit and they profit of your suffering.\n2. Being nice to myself and understanding drinking won't actually make me feel better.\n3. Smoking Weed People have totally understandable mixed feelings on here but in the early days when I had a craving for alcohol and it just wouldn't go away I would smoke. I haven't had a craving in over a month at this point so I haven't smoked. \n4. Enjoying whatever foods I wanted at FIRST\n5. Getting really into my health after I decided I was over junk food I'm really into Keto now. \n6. Once I got to a good place talking about it. Okay well I haven't told ppl about my problem exactly but alcoholism runs in my family which is part of why I wanted to quit. I know I'm not as bad as some of my relatives are but I don't ever want to be. Also because I'm a big health nut I've also started talking about how Alcohol is a horrible deadly poison and the FDA plays down the risk because the Alcohol Lobbiest wanna make money. I'm real fun at parties. lol. Luckily all my friends have been pretty cool with it a lot of us are in our late 20s and trying to get healthy in various ways before we hit 30 so luckily it hasn't been a big deal.\n\nThe only worry I have right now is I do have one friend who is pressurer. (Last time we hung out he was trying to pressure my friend that had an hour drive home to take a shot and I had to intervine and be like come on man. He's working on not doing it as much cuz we've told him how annoying it is) Anyways for my bday were doing a Movie night at him and his wifes house. They actually were the first friends I opened up with about my drinking so hopefully he doesn't forget cuz he might try to get me to drink but I'm bringing my bf as a support. (most of my friends in that group don't drink) \n\nAnyways thanks guys for all your advice and encouragement! I will not drink with you tonight! ",

Another time I notice a smirk on the clerks face after buying the drink in another store but today took the cake. I walk into the local store and already the two clerks are smiling.

I can't sleep, and I am seriously contemplating suicide. I don't have a single family member within a 1,000 miles of where I live and my boyfriend is unhappy with me and wants to break up, which adds even more stress and pain to my already overburdened mind. I honestly think this garbage world only caters to people with money and worth so it's probably better anyway. But I would like to at least be given the option of having something given to me thats not fucking alcohol so I can function. Any thoughts would be nice.",

   "selftext": "Disclaimer: I haven\u2019t been to an AlAnon meeting yet, but do plan on going soon. I know I need to. In the meantime, I wanted to put my thoughts down here.\n\nI recently, finally, confronted my mom about her drinking problem, this past Easter Sunday. She's been a functional box-of-wine-a-day alcoholic my entire life. My dad never had a drinking problem but he refuses to see that my mom has one, even after multiple confrontations. He's more of the \"therapy is bullshit and nothing is wrong, don't show emotions\" type of person. My childhood was pretty \"normal\" compared to other stories I've read here, but the emotional abuse was insidious enough. I'm now able to see my mom's current manipulations with my toddler nephew happening all over again, saying things that could affect how he understands emotional response, guilting him, etc. It's what made me realize a lot about my own upbringing, and I don't think she understands it's wrong. My parents love me, but they hurt me very badly, without me (or them?) realizing it until recently. She came from an alcoholic dad who beat her, and my dad came from a schizophrenic mom who was totally absent in his life. They both had to essentially raise themselves and I can see how the cycle works.\n\nAfter recently, and somewhat regretfully, blowing up on her after another night of dealing with her drunkenness, I have not really been in contact with her beyond a few texts from her saying she's \"working on it.\" I've always visited on Mother's Day, in fact I can't even recall missing a single Mother's Day or Father's Day or Easter or whatever. These are just things I feel totally obligated to do, to be a \"good\" son. I feel like if I don't go, or even don't call, I'll just make her depression worse. I also feel disappointed that she hasn't reached out to me to say she'd not drink if I visit, or even ask if I'm visiting. I'm just very confused on what I want to do. I want to visit to see my nephew, and other relatives in general, but I don't want to visit because I don't want to be around my mom drinking, ever again. I know she will feel pressure to drink or \"be herself\" as others visiting will be drinking. If I don't visit, I feel I'm making the problem worse. \n\nI know I can't know what will happen if I go or not, but I just don't know what to do. I also know I can't ask for any of you reading to decide for me, but maybe someone has some tips into how to either gracefully explain why I don't want to visit, or if maybe I should visit and set up hard boundaries? I mainly don't want to pretend like nothing is wrong, just like we've all done for my entire life. My dad is already trying to do that, texting me about random stuff (while it\u2019s about my life, it totally ignores the big confrontation.) The fact that it's literally Mother's Day annoys me. I'd rather just visit when it feels right and when my mom and I have some common ground rules. Maybe that's what I'll say. \n\nI have a lot of guilt for even confronting her, and now I\u2019m getting guilt about possibly not visiting on Mother\u2019s day. This is my mom who raised and loved me, and still does, but I\u2019m tired of watching her kill herself with wine. I hope she can turn it around and love herself. I have no idea how to get my mom back.",

   "selftext": "Yesterday, I experienced a nervous breakdown. It wasn't my first, I could see it coming from a long ways off. Facing a failing relationship, feeling as if my words don't matter, and that I'm a burden to everyone I love, I went to a place where I go to have a drink and enjoy a view on the edge of town. I did have my handgun with me, but I didn't think of using it. \n\nAfter a few drinks, I decided I needed to talk to somebody. I had talked to my family, and even if they were supportive, I felt going back to them would be too bothersome. In the past, I'd always been told I was fine, that nothing was wrong with me, and that I was making a fool out of myself for saying I had a problem. So I decided to call the Veterans Crisis Hotline. \n\nIn the Marine Corps, we're trained to toughen up and be ready to kill at all times. There was no time for negative emotions such as grief or depression, only anger to drive us forward. I was sent to Afghanistan less than a year of signing up. \n\nAfter a few months, I was to be up a minimum of 15 hours a day. In reality, I would go a couple days without more than an hour rest. I was tired, I kept messing up, I was depressed, but my job needed to be done. After sleeping in one too many times, I saw I was a detriment to my unit, and decided I needed to take myself out of the equation. I spent three hours trying to muster up the courage to pull that trigger, but the next Marine to take post arrived, and I told him everything. \n\nHalf a year later, I was medically discharged from the military. I hadn't even spent two years in the military, and I had yet to even accomplish anything. There's not been a day that goes by that I don't think about how things could've turned out if I did things differently. This made my depression worse, and alcoholism took hold of me quickly, and it's held on for 4 years now. \n\nI also had a failing relationship, and still do. We've been together almost six years, yet the past year, we've talked less and less to each other. She's constantly on her phone, she only talks about her field of work, and when I talk about something, anything I find interesting, I receive a reply of only a few words, usually just a bullshit, ill-planned reply. I wake up thinking every day will be different, that it'll be better. But it hasn't. \n\nI've told my SO about how I'm feeling, and despite her efforts and sweet personality, she told me she didn't know how to deal with me and I needed to get help elsewhere. I tried to get help, but every attempt failed for one reason or another. Even the simplest issues would cause immense stress, and the stress of all these problems and obligations built up, and I knew I had to do something quick. \n\nAfter a few drinks by myself on a lonely hillside, I decided I needed to call the crisis hotline. After two hours of talking and requesting additional help, the emergency services arrived. I was relieved I would at least get some help. A SWAT team truck and about seven cruisers showed up. Though I was getting help, it felt like I was getting punished. Every minor detail I missed or got wrong, I was called a liar and other names, and threatened with charges of resisting arrest and impeding and investigation. I just stuck to my military manner and spoke only when spoken to. The only officer that treated me like a human was my driver, and I greatly appreciate her help. \n\nI spent the night in the psych ward. I was tired, but I couldn't sleep. A schizophrenic man laughter the whole night and I would wake up after a brief moment of sleep to him screaming obscenities at the staff and people that weren't there. It was a very long night. \n\nI was discharged today. Still facing my problems, I'm not out of the woods, I've only gotten deeper. But now I know a direction to go in to help me recover and accomplish my goals. I still have many hard decisions to make, but I have hope that I can carry forward. Thank you for your time.",

I had finished all my school exams and my kids were staying with family for a few days. For some reason, I decided to celebrate the end of semester with a drink. It turned into a lot of drinks for about 5 days. I don\u2019t think I ate anything after day 1. \n\nOn Sunday morning, I woke up with a racing heart, shakes, etc. I had a massive panic attack.

I\u2019m entering an intensive outpatient rehab next week. I\u2019m home now on a 9-day Librium taper. I have no desire to drink now, but I know it will come in a few weeks or a few months. \n\nSo I\u2019ve decided to come here and stick around, if that\u2019s okay.

My dad has been verbally abused by her for as long as I can remember. as far as I know, my Mother has had a vendetta for as long as my life has been lived against the Mother of my father. I've never been given a clear answer as to why, but from what I gathered she never cared about me or my 2 brothers, and every negative quality she sees in my father, reminds her of his mother. I've been witnessing her drunken outrages my entire life. Starting at about 8 years old I began acting out towards my parents as far as generally disobeying them. If I didn't get what I wanted I would curse violently, and  storm into my room and lock the door. At times screaming at the top of my lungs the most hurtful things I could think of.  As years passed this anger had magnified along with my worsened obesity and decline of socializing. The worst part about all of this is that when my anger started to get to newfound heights, I had started physically damging doors, walls, in my house. Starting with my door. Then the bathroom door. Then the pantry door. Then my mom's door. And finally tonight, my brother's door. My 35 year old brother that thinks screaming at the top of his lungs is an ethical substitute for compromising calmly. These types of responses from him typically drive Mt o feel powerless with my response. No matter what I say or do or what logic I try to apply, nothing can make him talk to me like an equal. Like I am worthy enough to not be screamed down on. So that feeling of hopelessness lead me to stand up walk out of his room and punch his door. The top half came off the hinges and  then we proceeded to get into a scuffle which ended with my diabetes ridden father attempting to separate us. This probably reads choppy and scattered as hell but I have a clear problem. my entire life I have been taking my anger out physically on possessions of value or living utilities and I'm finally 100% fed up. I need coping mechanisms to practice using so I can consistently practice the prevention of future outbursts. I'm truly ashamed at myself. Ashamed that my entire life I've reacted with violence before logic. There so many reasons why this violence and negaitivity have been planted in my thoughts but I cant focus on that...I only want to focus on fixing my issues for the better of my family whom I truly want to love. \n",

Yes, I call myself a boy, 'cause of the state I'm now I'm a little boy, suffering, begging for help and an end for the suffering. I'm a lawyer, graduated last year. So, I started drinking when I was 13 years, hidden of course, and it was fine until 15. When I smoked pot, got panic attack, developed panic disorder, dp/dr(derealization/depersonalization), anxiety stuff. I went sober then, and went to meds and benzos(&lt;---fuck benzos)\n\nI managed somehow to control my attacks without benzos, I *ONLY*(not meant to be used daily, but my doctor said it was not a problem) took them for sleep since 2011. Not anymore. GABA receptors were being attacked them. I started drinking again in 2013, when I got panic under control, just DR/DP left. And I fucking found that drinking relivied it. So I drank like 3-5 times a week, until I went 5-7 a week or the maximum I went, 18 days straight fucking binge drinking.\n\nNow, a former lawyer, no more university, I have no job, I'm housebound, I'm going to lose my driver license because I was caught driving under the influence of alcohol (not drunk, different things ok? Here in Brazil, low concentrations are influences only, like 2, 3 beers.) I'm also addicted to a benzodiazepine called Clonazepam.\n\nHere my \"sober\" story starts. I take this drug everyday. 0.5mg, when I do not drink. 1mg-3mg mg when I'm hangover (glutamate rebound and doc. said it was ok, they have no clue, it's not), but then I was 6 days today without drinking and FUCK. I couldn't stand. I'm not a weak \"boy\". I had tremors, shaking, DP/DR, anxiety, almost a full blown panic attack, I just didn't panic because I knew this was the alcohol withdrawal. I thought \"Victor, this is your 6th day without drinking in YEARS. It's a body reaction.\" And I drank 5 long neck beers today to ease me, and now I'm going to sleep with the aid of clonazpeam.I don't want to be ALCOHOL FREE forever, I know for a while I will be, But, I don't know how to do it. I have the willpower to not drink when I don't. I know I fucked up with binge drinking during 5 years. But I think I can't do it cold turkey, too much suffering, too much pain, too much HELL. Moderation is the key, I should listened that years ago... thx guys.\n\nI just need some non cold-turkey schedule for this.\n",

In a sense I am very lucky with how relatively little my use of alcohol has impacted my life so far. However, this is also exactly the reason for me to write the post you are about to read. The point that I want to make is that for me alcohol has gone from an exciting social lubricant to a depressing social staple and that I\u2019ve had enough.\n\n\n\n**Background**\n\nSo to outline where I am coming from (literally and figuratively) here is my background. I was born in 1989 and grew up in the South of the Netherlands. Now what is important to know is that in this part of my country (or any rural part of the Netherlands for that matter) alcohol is (ab)used from a very young age on a very widespread scale. I grew up in a very normal working class family although most of my friends came from much more affluent families.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis meant that I was exposed to heavy drinking (mostly by my immediate family) from a very young age and that I myself started drinking from the age of 14 (the legal drinking age in the Netherlands was 16 at the time). And when I say started drinking I am not talking about half of a glass of wine at the dinner table or a sip of beer at a party but truly binge-like drinking. \n\n\nBetween the age of 14 and 18 I drank heavily (meaning I got drunk) at least twice a week. It is important to note that this was considered completely normal behavior at the time (although in hindsight it really wasn\u2019t), especially when you consider that all of this drinking sessions where very social events (pre-gaming, birthdays, house parties etc. So no lonely drinking sessions or anything like this).\n\n\nThis pattern continued and flourished during my time in law school (18-24) when drinking 3-4 days a week became the norm. Between parties at the student organization I was a member of and going out with my friends I was basically living from one occasion to drink to another. Again this was considered completely normal when looking at my social surroundings at the time (student culture in the Netherlands is very focused on alcohol in general).\n\n\nAfter finishing law school I joined a prestigious law firm where I was basically surround by alpha-type people who all subscribed (or at least pretended to subscribe) to a work hard/play hard lifestyle and happily played my part in all of this. Especially in the first two years of my career I would drink 2-3 times a week. What played a big role here for me is that drinking was extremely intertwined with work. There was a bar at the firm hosting free Friday afternoon drinks to blow off the steam of what was an extremely challenging professional setting. On top of this you had all kinds of networking events you were supposed to attend. In addition to this I would still have drinks with friends outside of work to keep a semblance of a social life afloat.\n\n\nAfter 2,5 years of being a lawyer (I mainly did real estate and M&amp;A transactions) I decided this was not the life for me and I switched to a position and commercial real estate fund. This ushered a change in my drinking behavior as well as I did not feel the need to drink as much as I did when I was working at the law firm (I could probably write a standalone post on the insidiousness of peer pressure but I will leave that for another day). During this period I  got tipsy/drunk maybe once a week (usually on Fridays) and I had a few drinks on Saturday and Sunday but nothing excessive. Part of this was that I was nearing the end of my twenties and really noticed that the after-effects of drinking became much worse. In other words the hangovers became much more brutal.\n\n\n\n**Lifestyle changes**\n\nRecently there have been a few major changes in my life that I think contributed greatly to my motivation to stop drinking (which I will go into later on). \n\n\nThe first major change is that I started a ketogenic diet as of January. For people who have no idea what this means it is basically a diet where you eat almost no carbohydrates and primarily sustain yourself with fatty foods (80%) and protein rich foods (20%). \n\n\nThe reason that I mention this is that alcoholic drinks often contain a lot of sugar (i.e. carbs) so this meant that while following the diet I would have to keep my alcohol consumption in check (or at least be picky with my drinks). In practice this meant I started drinking more white wine as opposed to beer but as wine still contains quite a lot of sugar I usually switched to hard liquor after a few glasses.\n\n\nNow a lot of people on the ketogenic diet (e.g. /r/ketodrunk) will argue that drinking alcohol is fine as long as you choose the right drinks and they are right for the most part but what I noticed while drinking in ketosis is that the way you get drunk is just less fun. Instead of the giddiness you feel when drinking a lot of (sugary) drinks I usually felt mellow and numbed. Not a state I particularly enjoy (especially given the hangovers that ketosis apparently exacerbates).\n\n\nThe second major change in my life is the fact that I moved to Paris in February for work. My new job involves a crazy amount of travelling by plane and I noticed that I just couldn\u2019t afford to even have a few drinks the evening before let\u2019s say a 7am flight as it would wreck me the next day. That combined with the fact that my new social circle in Paris (however small it might still be) doesn\u2019t know me as a guy who likes to drink makes it easier for me to just not do it (in other words: I haven\u2019t formed any \u2018drinking habits\u2019 yet in Paris, so why start?).\n\n\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThis brings me to my reasons for stopping drinking all together. My most obvious reason is that most of the time (epic moments aside) the price I have pay just doesn\u2019t stack up against the rewards. What I mean by this is that most times that I have a drink these days I don\u2019t really enjoy it as much as I used to (this might also be partly cause by the abovementioned diet). On the other hand I feel increasingly lethargic and borderline depressed when I drink even moderately (let alone excessively) in addition to the usual hangover symptoms.\n\n\nNow the question I have struggled with recently is: why is this bothering me now whereas in the past I happily paid the price for a good binge?\n\n\nWhat I managed to come up with so far is mainly that at this stage in my life I want different things for myself. I am very ambitious when it comes to my career and although I did just fine (all things considered) while still drinking casually I feel like I am missing a gear even when I am drinking just moderately. Also outside of work there are so many things I want to achieve (learn French, sports, reading, travel etc.) and friendships that I want to develop that I feel would suffer if I kept drinking casually. \n\n\nThis brings me to my more intrinsic motivation to stop drinking all together: self-worth. For me the worst side-effect of alcohol is by far how it erodes my self-discipline and subsequently how I feel about myself.\n\n\nJust to give an example: often I used to fully intend to go for a run on Saturday morning but would nevertheless have up to 10 drinks on a Friday evening. The next morning I would either (i) force myself to run, hating every minute of it (and myself for drinking so much); or (ii) stay in bed, watch Netflix and hate myself for not going for a run. \n\n\nNow you could say I shouldn\u2019t be so tough on myself and that it is no problem to let loose once in a while but the more I think about this argument the more it feels like an excuse to just give in to temptation and to use the words of Jocko Willink (who I think is extremely inspiring): \u2018discipline equals freedom\u2019 and freedom is extremely important to me.\n\n\n\n**Challenges** \n\nCurrently I am five weeks in and my biggest challenge so far has been by far social pressure. I am baffled by the responses I get when I tell friends I don\u2019t drink. From \u2018why, do you have an alcohol problem?\u2019 to \u2018not you as well with this hipster health shit?\u2019. \n\n\nA few of the responses have been supporting in nature but the overwhelming majority have been critical to say the least. This probably says a lot about my social circle (are my friends \u2018true friends\u2019 or just \u2018drinking buddies\u2019?) but what bothers me the most is that alcohol usage is so incredibly normalized that when you don\u2019t drink you are the outlier and not the guys slurring their speech and pissing in public.\n\n\nA second, more long-term challenge, is that I  might just find it easier to start drinking again. As I have never hit rock-bottom I can already hear that voice in my head saying \u2018it is ok, you have everything under control, just one night of going hard won\u2019t kill you\u2019. And the voice would probably be right, it won\u2019t kill me but it would keep me from reaching my goals (sooner rather than later).\n\n\n\n**Way forward**\n\nSo this journey for me has only just started. After five weeks I am still struggling to hold my own during social events where everyone is imbibing. Fortunately I am mentally in a very strong place right now so I am confident I will keep at it for the foreseeable future. I am already fully enjoying the short term perks of not drinking (no hangovers, I am sleeping better, I am more stable emotionally and have more energy to just name a few) and what I am looking forward to is the long term benefits. \n\n\nTo look back in 10 years and think of all the things I managed to do with the time I was not hung-over or drunk. Whether it regards my career, my hobbies or my friends and family I am sure not drinking will have a positive effect one way or another. What I am not looking forward to is losing friends that turn out to just be \u2018drinking buddies\u2019 but the most important thing is that I am willing to find out.\n\n\nI wanted to share this story with you all to see if there are others that find themselves similarly motivated to stop drinking and to hear your stories. \n\n\t\n",

   "selftext": "(this account pretty much exists for me writing on alanon, so feel free to read my [past posts if you need more details](https://www.reddit.com/user/Randelania/submitted/))\n\nIt's been a while since I've posted, which is actually sort of a good sign. My girlfriend's is now in therapy for her anxiety/depression and has been for a few months. The drinking is systematically decreasing and generally we've been having more good days than bad days. I keep track of the drinking  daily, and it's gone down from her being drunk one in every two days to one in every six (over a period of thirty days), which basically translates to her having a drunken long weekend once a month. During these long weekends i basically keep my distance, which is easy enough as we don't live together at this point.\n\nI can recognise that things are getting better but i know that work still has to be done. I'm happy that she's trying to sort herself out but it's clear that she still need to tackle certain things like finding employment as well as managing her anxiety/depression/self-worth issues.\n\nMy problem here is frustrating. As i can see she's doing better her overall attitude is starting to perk up. With this she's beginning to talk about our future together. In particular she's talking about moving in together and having kids. We've been together eight years now, and it's been the depression and alcohol use that's really been holding the relationship back. When the alcohol use got really bad starting about two and half years ago, all relationship development was essentially put on hold. \n\nNow it seems that for the first time in a long while things are actually getting better. She's getting herself sorted out and making plans. We can actually arrange to do stuff with friends and go on holidays without the whole thing being spoiled because i get to hers with suitcases packed only to find her surrounded by bottles of wine. Since this is no longer happening it feels like we should be able to start moving on. \n\nThe problem is i'm holding back, because I've been in this position before in smaller doses, and i'm hesitant to make any real moves forward knowing that there's a possibility of a huge relapse at any time. There was a time when she stayed sober for a month and a half, and it looked like things were picking up again, but this was then followed a period of about four months where she was essentially drunk every other day. She's now been mostly sober for three months, and she's in therapy and taking the exercises seriously, and she's constantly focused on ensuring she eats right to maintain a healthy diet (she has a vitamin deficiency, which was a factor in the depression, which was one of the main causes of her alcohol use).\n\nMoving the relationship forward is starting to get more pressing. We're now in our mid-thirties and she really wants to have kids. I'm willing to wait but i'm younger so i understand why it might be more concerning for her. One boundary i still have in place though is that she needs to remain sober for a full six months before i'm willing to have kids with her, since i feel she needs to show she can handle stress without turning to the booze (especially with the stresses and responsibilities of having a baby).\n\nAm i wrong to be so hesitant? I look at her today and compare her to the person from four months ago and it feels that she's improved a lot, but i feel it could all be temporary. She still has her relapses, but even these feel like they have more control and last for shorter periods. I'm worried that i'm going to be the one holding back and causing problems if i'm not careful.\n\nThanks for your time. Any advice is appreciated.",

   "selftext": "I live in a frat house and the place is virtually soaked in alcohol. Everyone here loves to find an excuse to get wasted, and there is a good chance that there are people to drink with any night of the week (and most days too). It feels like living in a liquor store with all of your friends where all the alcohol is free. I've tried over and over to sober up, but when alcohol is all around you it feels like there are just too many \"first drinks\" than I can say no to. I've tried staying somewhere else (even at a sponsors house) for a few days to sober up, but I inevitably get drunk when I eventually come home. I know getting sober is hard no matter what your environment is (learned the hard way), but I feel like I live in the eye of an alcoholic hurricane with dozens of enablers. Even going to meetings feels pointless when I know I'll come home to people partying. \n\nDon't know why I'm posting, just need to vent i guess. 6 days is the longest I've been sober in months so I should be more optimistic!\n\nI will not drink with you today",

   "selftext": "Another Wednesday, another trip to the alternate universe that sits 36 miles from my home.  It is actually something I look forward to, as it gives me a chance to be with my friend as we carpool on the drive, and then there is the meeting which is always powerful.   \n\nAt the meeting we go through the steps, one a month, and it being May - it's time for the dreaded fifth.   \"Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.\"\n\nWhoa doggies, in prison - a room full of thieves, murderers, and who knows what?  - And, no, they didn't recite a litany of crimes; that's been done in court rooms, interrogation rooms, it's on rap sheets and on the papers they submit to the parole board.  \n\nInstead we talked about the bigger and underlying secret - There was something fundamentally wrong with us - the something that forced us to self medicate to the point of stupidity - in so many ways the crimes were just incidental to the interior void we were trying to fill with drugs, alcohol, sex, things, things that sometimes we stole. And rage, rage that gets you a sentence of 20 to life if it gets out of control.\n\nYes the fifth step is about the things we did, or didn't do.  It's also deeper, it's allowing us to look at the pattern to connect the dots and see that under the anger and hurt and isolation there is someone who is not all that different - that the shame needs be shed if we are going to be able to repair the faulty self esteem that got us here in the first place.\n\npreachybit/ During the meeting I said \"Just saying I am slipacre, and I am an alcoholic - is a significant part of the the fifth step.  That was the BIG secret - even from myself - in a way the rest was just details.\" The same goes for anyone who logs on here - maybe you aren't ready to put the label \"alcoholic\" all the way on, but somewhere in your google history there is the word problem or stop drinking.  That secret is, like a good case of the runs, pushing to get out. /preachybit\n\nOne of the men said, \"just coming here is kind of a fifth step too, I can talk about things I can't say anywhere else - especially not in general population.\"  And this is very true, while a formal fifth step is a great idea and needs, in my opinion, be done sooner or later it is also done in bits and pieces as we hear someone in a meeting saying something that was a shameful secret, and being able to say \"I did that too.\"  This is important because we have to get rid of the shame - it will drag us down.\n\nAs an agnostic I kind of slide over the God part of this step - I do have a sense of karma though - and know that life has gotten a whole lot better since I stopped poisoning myself so much and so often.  Those of you with a different set of beliefs will get help there too.  Again it is the shame we have to break free of.\n\npreachybit2/The pretending that things are ok - the clinging to words like \"functional\" or \"just binge\" (which I did) to keep from facing the truth that yes, YOU have a problem.   THAT PRETENDING is only prolonging the suffering - is only ensuring the bottom is going to be worse.  the problem --- It's not going away, it's not going to get better if you switch to wine, or a better grade of whiskey\" this denial of the reality - is what holds us back from getting the help (from AA or where-ever) we need.  And it is help we need because we are fighting isolation. /preachybit2\n\nThe drive home through the fading light was quiet and reflective.  I've heard this man's fifth step, and know he is at peace with his past. Given his past that's quite an accomplishment.  In large part it's what keeps him from having the urge to drink again and has allowed him to move on with his life.\n",

   "selftext": "**TLDR - The over glorification of mental disorders as of late are seriously harming the people's perspective about mental disorders as it seriously dumps down the seriousness of these mental disorders, let alone the unique individual experiences among different mental disorders, even if you have people who exhibit the same symptoms of a certain mental disorder (if you have two people with depression, you cannot treat them the same because the impact of that certain disorder are completely different and unique for those specific respective individuals)**\n\nSo there seems to be a double standard nowadays when it comes to the subject of mental illnesses.\n\nOn one hand, the stigma about mental illnesses are still there, whether it is used for literary purposes such as in comic book stories, the villains are often regarded as psychotic, maniacal or sadistic which are stereotypical words to address the mentally ill (which is fine as a literary concept because they can be good stories) and this kind of stigma also exists in the real world in so many ways - some people still use religion as a defence or an explanation for certain mental illnesses (especially the ones that not many are aware of or much strange to comprehend), there are still ideas about mental illnesses that are not really understood like telling someone with depression to get over it (or perhaps people do it because they do not know how to react to that situation), or some people think that eating disorders like anorexia is a habit or a choice considering that there are pro-anorexia articles and even stories of people managing to change their lives with unorthodox methods that could seriously damage their body or their mind but somehow managed to walk away unscaved\n\n*(and to be perfectly honest, this taboo has been so intertwined and so deeply integreted in many cultures and many forms of mainstream thought for generations that I do not think that the stigma will go away. Even me, a psychology graduate, despite that I want to refrain from judging or stigmatising anyone with a mental disorder, my unconscious instinctively tells me to walk away from them or not to contact them as if I was repeatedly told that these people are weird and the weird must be too much to understand so it is often a conscious battle for me to avoid this impulse)*\n\nOn the other hand, I am noticing a slow trend of the more positive portrayals of those with mental disorders -\n\nThere are tons of more positive or at least less-demonising portrayals of people with mental disorders or in fact of people without any clear diagnosis of a certain mental disorder but just people with their own problems like \n\n- Good Will Hunting\n\n- the portrayals of  certain superheroes like Batman who happens to have his own mental disorders and mental troubles, Ironman who struggled with alcoholism, Spiderman who sometimes suffers from depression and PTSD and so on\n\n- The Perks of Being a Wallflower\n\n- In Treatment TV series\n\n- A Beautiful Mind \n\nAnd there are many others out there that portray those with mental disorders in a more humanising way.\n\n*(NOTE - Bear in mind that the concept of mental disorders is extremely difficult and complicated. While some symptoms are clear for certain disorders, sometimes to distinction between a mental disorder or \"normal\" human behaviour is not very clear. Plus, what we define as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" is not objective and this led to some misconceptions or mistakes or even misdiagnosis as well. Like for Thomas Zsazs and his argument against mental illnesses and the Rosenhan experiment)*\n\nHowever, as much as I like this portrayal - **I am really f%$king tired of the over-glorification of this portrayal**\n\nFor starters, there is a **BIG DIFFERENCE** between empowerment and glorification. \n\n*(because most of these disorders cannot be actually \"cured\" but mostly treated. You have to learn to live with your demons or become above them in some way instead of completely eliminating them because your \"demons\" can come up with so many ways and we mostly do not get rid of them entirely)*\n\nYes, we need to empower these people and let me know how to live along with their own personal struggles and treating people with mental disorders is often hard, complex and takes time because there are often many different factors working together, sometimes factors that the therapist is not even aware of or the client does not mention until long after the first session, and there are often different methods to treat certain disorders, even the most common ones \n\nAnd also some disorders are not given the same recognition as other disorders as either they are very rare or are not given the enough attention or budgets to be researched or beacuse of taboo because some social circles have more collective views that seriously hinder or even influence the concept of mental illnesses such as more collective social groups such as Asian countries such as academic success is incredibly strict and scary in Asian countries like Japan and South Korea and this slowly increases students' anxiety levels, fear of failure, fear of being inadequate or shunned if they fail or do not mean expectations, and even the likelihood to commit suicide because they are unable to process or resist or tackle all the anxiety they are experiencing and find it too hard to handle, or because they failed a test and find the failure so overboaring with fear and negative emotions that they feel that there is no hope for them and feel that the only way out is to commit suicide and avoid a lifetime of shame -\n\n **that is seriously f%$ked up and a pattern of behaviour with little oppurtunities to counter these factors because they often reinforce each other like a complex system or structure that goes full circle**\n\n\n\nHowever, if you over-glorify these people who exhibit these symptoms and struggles, **you are completely eliminating the struggle part of this phenomenon**\n\nI see this mostly when it comes to the portrayal of those with autism and there is a sudden rise of interest of treating and researching the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) because there are so much that we do not really know for sure how ASD develops and what exactly causes someone to develop ASD or how the brain works with someone with ASD or shows symptoms of a pattern involving ASD against someone who does not.\n\nFine, some people with ASD are very bright. They will exhibit unbelievable amount of interest in certain things (what people would call Asperger's which is now mostly considered as high-functioning autism) and maybe their own unorthodox thoughts can exhibit their own creative manners of creativity as those with ASD are extremely rigid in thinking (kinda like someone with OCD but those with ASD really do not like change to this consciously) and cannot understand others' perspectives (lack of theory of mind)\n\nHowever, those with ASD can be really, really, really annoying.\n\nThey can be loud, annoying, sometimes even physical or emotionally abusive and it takes an enormous amount of discipline for parents and therapists to handle and treat these people with this kind of condition\n\nWhat about the portrayal of other things such as depression and anxiety? These are the most common disorders in the world and every single person who displays certain symptoms of these two disorders are affected in their own way (because one of them is a mood disorder and can potentially be very personal to the person, the other is an anxiety disorder which can also be very personal especially when it comes to threatening stimuli)\n\nAnd yet, the portrayal so far about these (whether it is by the media or people who talk about these on social media), either they are glorified to the point that they neglect the seriousness of these disorders, or the normalise this disorder so much because of how common they are (almost like the common cold) and minimise the seriousness of these symptoms (almost like being with depression is like having a bad day instead of the more apathetic and gloomy form of emotion, or having an anxiety attack or a panic attack is regarded similarly to being stressed in a more \"normal\" manner)\n\n(even lately when someone says something about a certain psychological phenomenon, they will either try to bash it as if they are psychology experts when not even me can even mention my own opinion because I am only a psychology graduate; or they are often over-glorified as if they are taking advice from a guru like for example lately the clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson has increased in popularity lately (among other things that he talks about) and many people have different opinions about what he says and his expertise but many people often take his word like it is a the word of God and that is seriously damaging because it goes a lot against of how therapy sessions work because the therapist is meant to be a guide, a person who can give you the way on how to think and NOT what to think)*\n\nOr even lately where those with mental disorders are often regarded as creative artists like painters or film makers (taking inspiration from the Troubled Artist archetype like Van Gogh). While it is true somewhat that some people with mental disorders actually are able to develop creative forms of art as a form of therapy as art therapy actually exists and is quite effective, that does **NOT** necessarily mean that those with mental disorders will eventually become artists or those that do not have mental disorders do not have the ability to become great artists.\n\nYes, for some reason, some people managed to a sense of awe within their mental disorders.\n\nSome people use it to develop some forms of art, some people use it to help others, some people use it as inspiration or drive for other goals.\n\nJust because there are people who do not exhibit the most common of mental disorders, it does not mean that they are lacking in their ability to do something or at least something meaningful. \n\nJust because you have a mental disorder such as depression, does not necessarily mean that you will eventually be a good artist (unless you want to) and just because you do not have a mental disorder (or at least was not diagnosed with one), does not mean that you are not able to do a good job or do not have the inspiration or drive to develop something meaningful or impactful like art\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo I think you understand what I am saying here.\n\nThere is a pattern of a double-edge sword when it comes to the portrayals of this phenomenon.\n\nOn one hand, there is still the usual portrayal of mental illness as mostly a common plot element for many crime shows or horror flicks *(well, except for the American Psycho film as its portrayal has its own themes)*.\n\nOn the other hand, while there are efforts to help people realise that those with mental disorders are human as well, most portrayals of late are used so often and used as a plot device as a more of an \"excuse\" for how certain characters behave, it gives viewers the wrong impression about mental disorders as well",

   "selftext": "I don't know why I can't stop doing this to myself... (Sorry, this is going to be a pretty long post, but thank you in advance to anyone who will take the time to read it.)\n\nI had last drunk a week ago (Thursday 3rd May) and then been sober for three days. So Monday was day 4, and my anxiety was through the roof. (I've already learnt that days 3 and 4 tend to be when your anxiety reaches it peak.) It was probably the worst *psychological* withdrawal I've experienced so far, I felt like crying all the time. (Physically I was pretty much ok, apart from terrible fatigue.) I had to go to work although I felt completely unable to function normally. But somehow I managed to get things done...\n\nOK, I so then it's Tuesday (the day before yesterday) and day 5. I weak up feeling **normal** again. The sense of relief... it's always so wonderful. But what do I decide to do on Tuesday afternoon/evening, after my psychoanalysis (when I often feel upset because of the tough things that are discussed there)? Something inside me convices me that it'll be a good idea to buy two bottles of wine. So I do that (and I've eaten very little all day). I have a great time drinking and drawing that night (https://redd.it/8dvbyg), and I stay up until 5 a.m. Not that I intend to, but you know how time just flies when you're wasted and doing something you enjoy...\n\nThen it's Wednesday (yesterday). I wake up around noon feeling **terrible**. I nearly faint on my way to the kitchen to get some water. I mostly stay in bed until 5 p.m., not really sleeping, just dozing off  for brief moments every now and then. Then I finally get up and feel sort of okayish (apart from a headache) for a couple of hours, and I already think the worst is over. But then comes the **nausea**. Now I haven't eaten anything all day (no apetite), I've only been drinking sports drinks to rehydrate myself. But I end up vomiting several times that evening and still during the night (last night). Although there is nothing but a little liquid inside my stomach. I stay awake most of the night, unable to fall asleep, although I've taken as much medication as I've dared. Also, I keep sweating and shivering from cold at the same time. **Now** (it's afternoon in my timezone) I'm finally sort of ok again.\n\nI'm confident I won't drink today; alcohol repulses me right now (after how sick I've been). But I'm going out to dinner with friends tomorrow night and I am **so scared** of what may happen. They are my best friends and I don't \"need\" alcohol to feel relaxed around them. But I know they will all be drinking, probably sparkling wine and wine. (They are all moderate drinkers.) I'm so worried the temptation will be too much for me... I haven't seen them in a while, so I really want to go. If only I could just stick to drinking non-alcoholic drinks...\n\nI've started to feel so helpless over alcohol that I often find myself thinking what illness I'd rather take than alcoholism if I had to have one and I could choose. And diseases like diabetes come to my mind... I don't mean to offend any diabetics here (I know diabetes is a serious illness), but this just shows how desperate I am. I honestly fear I will never recover from this.",

   "selftext": "I have fallen back into a dark, unforgiving place. This is the only place I trust to at least hear me out. \n\nI feel so fucking alone. I feel like there are walls that are closing in on me. \n\nI thought finally leaving home, leaving behind a fractitious home, a miserable high school experience, and all of my inner demons that haunted me for college would be one of the most liberating things to happen to me. I feel like I am wrong now. \n\nA bit of background:\nMy parents never got along. Been together since they were teenagers. Growing up, seeing the constant fights and verbal viritol became commonplace. Shit rolls downhill. Throughout my adolscelent years, up until my senior year of high school it was all piled on me. Its my fault that \"parent1/parent2\" suffers. , \"I am a quiet loser who will die alone.\" and a whole bunch of other fun shite. I also got mugs, glass, the whole nine thrown at me. I got into fistfights with my alcoholic father at the height of it. It fucking sucked. For the better of the family, both of my parents have seperated and are awaiting a official divorce, a bittersweet revelation, but certainly for the best. I fucking hated them, but time heals, I guess? \n\nShit back home got to me in high school. I am a natural introvert. I am quiet and like to keep to myself or a very small, but tight knit group of friends, if I could even call it that. Evidently, I had a hard time making friends, not the best socially. Even the \"friends\" I did make seemed to only befriend me out of pity. I did do well academically, and got into a solid school for engineering. All that shit back home, being alone at school, made me yearn to leave for college and leave that superficial, stuck up, fake ass pretentious dump behind.\n\nI will concede, the switch to college has been a slight improvement. I tried to force myself to get out there and try new things, meet new people. Yet, to no avail. \n\nI try not to let it bother me, but I cant help to admit that it does make me a bit envious to see others look so happy, bright, and full of life, and when I try to input or something, the same blank, disintrested, and slightly annoyed look I get from everyone. \n\nSchools been shit, too. I am on academic probation this quarter after failing a few classes, something new to me, as before college I never failed a class before. Going from a 3.8+ GPA to barely keeping your head up above 2 is fucking demoralizing. No matter how much I put in the effort to improve, same fucking result. \n\nI mentioned my parents are divorcing right ? \n\nI catch up with my mom, who has moved to  Nevada with my sisters, in my college town as it was on the way back from their visit. The look on her face killed me. Red eyes, with tears streaming down her face, lamenting on her fights with my narcasistic grandmother, sister, and sporadic phone arguments with my pops. I talked to him recently too. Sounded happier than usual to hear from me. Skin is turning yellow and frail from his long rampant alcoholism and as much of an ass he was, He was on the verge of tears about how lonely he is, etc. \n\nMy roomates are two of the most friendly people I have met, and our friendship or what seems to be one looks to be in place well beyond college. They get along better than I do with them though, \"You're just different man, dont sweat it.\" Lighthearted banter, especially about how I cant make other friends, get a girlfriend, and all the other run of the mill BS hits deep taking into account the afformentioned stuff. \n\nI dont click with anyone nor seem to fit in anywhere, oftentimes like back in high school, I find myself unable to sleep or quietly crying myself to sleep, not being able to force myself out of bed till midday, because of my isolation. My family is too far away from me to reach out to, and too far for me to be able to help them through their struggles.I am  fucking alone here and it fucking kills me inside. I battle with frequent fluctuations of grief,sadness, anger/rage, and relative indifference. The best part is when people who didnt give half a shit about you before feel like coming up to you now to ask \"everything ok man?\" They don't really care to hear me out  they just want the gratification. I have no true friends, and its feeding into the depression and pressure to succeed\n It sucks being alone. Some reassurance or even the smallest kind gesture, like a hug would go a long way right now. \n",

   "selftext": "I don't even know where to start. There's a storm of thoughts in my head and it's hard to put them all in a coherent text.\n\nSo, I'm a 21 year old guy. And basically, I'm depressed 90% of all the time. I feel ugly, stupid, week and hopeless.\n\nI'm a statistics student and the university is killing me. For all my life I've been considered a nerd and I was used to getting high marks, being liked by the teachers at school and being considered an intelligent kid. I actually never felt happy since my childhood but I was proud of my academic achievements and that gave me at least a little confidence. However, things changed when I got into uni. It's my 3rd year and I constantly feel like I'm not good enough. I'm tired of not understanding things, sitting through 10 hours stydying and still not getting results I want, seeing people who are doing better than me and feeling like I got to the wrong place. I got to the point where I'm afraid to study because I know I will feel stupid and miserable. I've always tried to do the maximum, but now I just want to reach the lowest possible mark that's enough to pass. No matter what I try to do I feel like I'm always about to fail.\n\nMy motivation has reached the lowest level. All of the life goals I had a few years ago have been destroyed and I feel like it's a mistake that I'm alive. There's a bit more than one year until I get my degree and I'm scared of what I'm going to do with my life because it feels like I have no knowledge and no talents and no one's going to hire me. There's not a single thing I could be happy about left in my life.\n\nI have no friends and I'm suffering from social anxiety. I've been a shy smart kid since my childhood. I'm highly introverted and I feel scared of communicating with unknown people. There's no one I can talk to besides my mum. I feel like a weirdo and no one needs me. I don't understand people and they don't understand me. I don't have what to say to them and even when I try discussing things it feels like I always think differently than others and I'm always in the minority. Phoning my hairdresser to register to have my haircut is a huge challenge for me, not even mentioning going to institutions where I have to speak to completely unknown people. I have panic attacks because I don't know how to act in unknown situations when I have to go to new places. I couldn't even count the amount of mental breakdowns I have when I travel to another city or country because I feel like my social abilities are worse than those of a 3 year old child.\n\nI had to go to a new city to study and leave my parents' home 3 years ago. That was when things started going downhill for me. Getting used to a new city and new people was a nightmare. I used to cry every single day. Flats are too expensive to rent so I'm living in a dormitory \u2013 the worst place for a socially awkward pervert like me. My first roommate was quite good \u2013 we weren't friends and we almost didn't speak but there were almost no problems living with him. However, he moved out a year ago and since last September I'm living with a new one who is a disaster. He doesn't clean the room, doesn't respect my privacy, has thousands of friends (I somehow managed to tell him I don't want them in the room). I can't live a normal life when there's a noise around and he just doesn't understand that. He likes playing loud music and even worse \u2013 singing along. Even when he's not playing music he somehow manages to irritate me with little things like forgetting to close the door. Neither can I relax nor concentrate to study when he's around. Thank god, he often goes somewhere else and leaves me alone. I live in an ex-Soviet small Eastern European country and the conditions in the dormitory are not as great as you'd expect to see in a normal western country. There's a lack of space and I feel like imprisoned between these walls. I come back to my parents every single weekend to escape this ugly place. I could search for a job place to get money and rent a flat but I'm afraid to change my life because of my anxiety. Also, my studies require a lot of time and effort and I don't think I could manage combining work and studying.\n\nAll I enjoy to do is staying home and doing nothing. All the common hobbies most young people have are unfamiliar to me because they often involve going out and being surrounded by people which I hate. My life is like a vicious circle \u2013 I'm tired of being lonely and I want to have friends but when I'm surrounded by people I just want to escape and be alone. I just can't connect with people. I hate small talk. I want to discuss politics, environment, the meaning of life, music, but people of my age are just not interested. Even when they are interested they usually have popular opinions and refuse to view things from different angles. That leads to me not being able to be myself because I have to act like I'm 'normal', like everybody else. I have to like parties, I have to like current pop music, I have to prefer summer over winter and etc. Some people probably consider me arrogant because I just can't act things. I tell it how it is and I don't want to be fake and overpolite.\n\nThe only person who understands me is my mother. I feel that she loves me and cares about me. She's probably the only reason I haven't committed suicide as I don't want to hurt her. However, I hate my father. He's an alcoholic, he's constantly arguing with my mother. He doesn't understand me and doesn't even try to. He's not intentionally a bad person but he irritates me and I just hate it when he's home.\n\nBesides all that, I hate the way I look. I'm skinny and short and I don't feel manly enough. My skin is pale as I hate going out. I hate my hair, my jawline, my skinny arms and just my whole body in general. My speaking voice is quite high-pitched and when I get nervous from my anxiety it sounds even more feminine than it already does. Stereotypes in society don't make it any easier to accept myself. I want to be a man, not a boy. I've always hated exercising. For me it's just unpleasant and boring. I've tried working out many times to get more muscular but I always end up feeling weak and hopeless and giving up.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, I'm gay. I've realized that quite recently, about a year ago, and it makes me hate myself even more. No one knows that and I don't even know if I'd dare to tell that to anybody. The fact that society in my country is very homophobic would make it even harder. I feel like I'll not only end up being this lonely, unhappy and insecure for the rest of my life, but also a virgin.\n\nI could write a book about all of the problems and stress I'm having but that's enough. Writing this and pouring out these emotions has helped a little bit. Thanks to anyone who is taking their time to read this.",

   "selftext": "Hey all, new to the sub and first time posting. I have looked over the rules but if there's anything inappropriate in my post, please let me know. \n\n\nIn July 2016, when I was 18, I was sexually assaulted. For context, I'm a woman, I live in rural Australia and I was living with a friend at the time after being kicked out by my mother for a suicide attempt. I am also a survivor of incestuous molestation when I was a child and have trauma relating to that. Because of this, I was already in a fairly fragile state of mind and I was drinking a lot, going out every night with my friends to our town's few pubs and one nightclub. \n\n\nWe were out one night, I was pretty drunk, we went to the nightclub. Standard operating procedure for us, really. We went outside the club for a cigarette and met a couple of Scottish backpackers, a man and a woman. The man immediately took a shine to me and we sat together and shared a few kisses. At this point I was drunk enough that he needed to hold my head up in place to kiss me but was still conscious, walking, talking, etc. Just a bit drowsy. \n\n\nWe decided to go back to our house as a group and continue drinking in the backyard shed, which was set up as a drinking and smoking area. Our house was within walking distance of town and the walk in the cold sobered me up a little bit, and while we were all sitting in the shed, the kissing continued while my friend chatted with the woman. Sometime during this, he started to get very insistent with groping me and I'm not sure why but I stopped being able to move at all. It's difficult to describe but it was like I only existed in my head, and in my head was this dark, stormy ocean with a big grey rock in the middle, and I kept hearing/thinking the words \"I am a rock in the ocean, and nothing will beat me away\" and apart from that it was very difficult to sort of perceive my surroundings. I could hear my friend and the woman talking in the background, and I could feel the man trying to shove his tongue through my clenched teeth, reaching into my shirt and pinching my nipples really hard, groping around under my skirt and gripping onto my neck to hold my head in a position that would enable him to keep kissing me, except this time my teeth were clenched and I was unable to move. \n\n\nThis continued until my friend noticed I wasn't moving and told him to get away from me. She pulled me onto the floor, and I hit the back of my head on the concrete floor because I was unable to move (she still feels bad about this which is ridiculous because I believe she saved me from being raped). After trying to get me to respond, she ordered one of our friends to call an ambulance and held me until the paramedics came. \n\n\nThis part is what confuses me. When the paramedics arrived, they automatically decided that I was just a drunk girl playing dead to get attention because I was having eye movement that indicated that I was conscious. While they were saying this, I was unable to move my body or speak and my brain kept replaying this scene of the ocean, but I could still hear everything going on, it just was kind of in the background. They tried a couple of methods to get me to wake up but nothing really worked, even a sternum rub (which hurt for a week after). Through the whole experience, they were saying things like \"Come on, (name), time to stop playing around now, this is serious\" and my friend was begging me to please just wake up and I couldn't move. \n\n\nThis went on for a while, I'm not sure how long, until I slowly started being able to move my hands again and then my whole body. I immediately started sobbing and all I could say is \"please help me\" and I clung to one of my friends and was very confused (I remember I kept saying, \"he bit me, he bit me\" referring the the pinching of my nipples because I couldn't grasp how to communicate the pain and \"bit\" seemed like the right word). \n\n\nAnyway, I've got a couple of theories about what happened to me but was looking to see if anyone else had a guess, as this is the first time I've actually been able to type up the whole thing. Which I guess is good because I'll be able to take it to my counselor next week. My initial theory was that because of the sexual trauma earlier in life, I had a really intense dissociation which lead to me being assaulted. However, recently I've heard that humans can experience tonic immobility during sexual assault, so maybe that's what happened? I don't know. I'd just like some closure I guess, because I still feel like it's my fault that this all happened, and that the paramedics were annoyed at me and felt like I wasted their time. \n\n\nThanks for reading xx\n\nEdit: formatting\n",

She has self-medicated with alcohol, although I wouldn't really characterize her as an alcoholic...more as someone with undiagnosed, untreated, unattended to emotional and mental health problems. \n\nThis is all complicated by the fact that she is very bright- had a 4.0 GPA across college and can be very manipulative in avoiding opening up, making diagnosis challenging.\n\nI think that an all-women's recovery center might offer the most value in terms of affording her the opportunity to grow and heal alongside others whose perspectives and experiences relate to as similar of situations as possible. That said, suggestions for any good treatment center would be much appreciated.\n\nWe live in the southwestern United States. Locations in California, Colorado, Arizona, Utah (if there are any which specifically avoid Mormon influence) would be ideal, but any and all suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nThank you so much in advance.\n\n\n\n***TL;DR: Sister tried to commit suicide...has untreated and undiagnosed mental health issues relating to PTSD, depression, anxiety, and others...I don\u2019t think she should return to our toxic home...huge social issues-cannot get along with anyone...looking for inpatient treatment/recovery centers specializing in comprehensive treatment of these issues...all-women's centers might be best, but any and all suggestions are needed***",

I\u2019ve had a touch-and-go relationship with alcohol my entire \u2014 well, not my ENTIRE life of course, but ever since I started dabbling with liquor at a typical teenage time (I\u2019m 25 now). \n\nSometimes I have absolutely no problem knocking back a few with friends. The booze makes me feel loose and happy the way that most people describe it. I very rarely drink to excess, usually I just drink to enjoy the taste and the company. I\u2019ll sit at the bar and chat with friends and everything is fine. \n\nBut sometimes our good friend rears her ugly head and makes me second-guess EVERYTHING about alcohol. I\u2019ll convince myself that my best friends or fianc\u00e9e are going to become alcoholics even though they\u2019re not drinking more than typical 20-something hospitality workers. I\u2019ll obsess that I\u2019M going to become an alcoholic or get alcohol poisoning. I have intrusive thoughts of me or my loved ones dying in a gruesome DUI-induced car accident. Often I get so anxious and wrapped up in my own head that I wind up feeling nauseous and vomiting, even though I only had a drink or two. I\u2019m just that anxious. \n\nPlease tell me I\u2019m not the only one here. My anxiety and paranoia about this is ruining social gatherings and I hate myself for it. ",

   "selftext": "I posted a long story not too long ago about why I decided to quit drinking again. \n\nThe first time I quit, last year, I did so for eight months and I didn't really take it seriously as \"alcoholism\". I had decided my problem wasn't alcohol *per se* just that it was exacerbating my own emotional instability. \n\nI went to AA meetings when I first quit and it didn't really connect with me. I listened to other people's stories and I thought, \"well, I don't have that physical compulsion to drink, I must not be an alcoholic.\" I still abstained and I did so for eight months. I was fine going to bars, being around friends drinking etc without feeling the need to drink. \n\nOf course, it turned out that regardless of whether I have that compulsion, it's the risk of what I could turn into when I drink that is the problem. \n\nI am taking my alcoholism an order of magnitude more seriously this time around. I've been to AA meetings almost every single day for the last 18 days. I've opened my ears and unlike the last time I am actually hearing stories that resonate with me of which I can relate. I have shared at most of them. A lot of it is repetition but saying stuff out loud over and over again helps me come to terms with myself. I have met people and exchanged phone numbers and I am slowly developing a network. I still haven't started the steps, I don't have a sponsor or a home group, but I am taking my time. \n\nIt's broken me out of my rationalization and justification for certain beliefs I had about interpersonal relationships, love and romance. Where before when I quit drinking I was still stubbornly holding on to certain resentments and beliefs about how I was slighted, I have finally opened my eyes to how perceivably dangerous and scary my behavior is to other people especially women. \n\nI have lost a lot of friends many of whom I probably won't be able to make amends with for a very long time, but I have others who have stuck by me and who want to see me get better. Who believe me in despite how I acted. \n\nI am trying so fucking hard.",

Most of my life I have wanted to do one thing in particular to make a living, but when I was drinking it caused me to neglect others (personal relationships and clients) and put aside most daily considerations or tasks. I also drank all my income. It was a wreck.      \n\nAt three years sobriety I have successfully established myself in that field. Most of my days are spent doing what I love. I don't make a lot of money, but I pay my bills and can afford to go out for fellowship opportunities.     \n\nLife now is hard but I love it. I'm still sorting through a lot of my past baggage (physically as well as mentally) and I've had some pretty big speedbumps in sobriety. This is okay, life always has some \"next thing\" to get through, that's just life. However I have been wondering why I keep working like I do.      \n\nI'm thriving on my lifestyle now. I go to meetings almost every day, I have time for fitness and health, meditation, everything I needed and still need. My reputation in work keeps growing and I am finding more clients who are of far more industry presence than I am.      \n\nI still worry that I might neglect other people or that my meetings and fitness stuff might get in the way of doing client work. I feel like I'm missing either focus or balance. The money isn't coming like it was in my first two years of sobriety.      \n\nI truly wonder how my ego is all mixed up in this. Am I supposed to be doing something I'm naturally talented at and which garners me acclaim professionally when it doesn't really build a financial base? Is this something which is build on arrogance and self-centeredness, should I discount my happiness (which I've never felt like this before) and view this as a defect of character to which I should overcome? Am I helping other people with my work, or does it have potential to do so? Is the day job of the recovered alcoholic intended to be of service to others or can we live a career choice which enables outreach in the off-hours, being satisfied with that? I don't know what my higher power wants me to do in this situation. I feel like everything is going well in general.",

   "selftext": "Hello, all! I am so  glad I\u2019ve found y\u2019all.\n\nI am 350 days alcohol free, and it really hasn\u2019t been an issue. I still pop into bars to see my friends, drinking Red Bull and Topo Chico, which I found to be excellent substitutes for alcohol. Once people start getting goofy, I head home, and am always glad I\u2019m home safe and sober. Mind you, this is very rare, I simply use this as an example of my will power during my recovery. \n\nRecently, a good friend said to me, \u201cafter one year, do you think you\u2019ll start moderating alcohol? You\u2019ll never know if you can if you don\u2019t try.\u201d I\u2019ve actually had several people ask me about moderation, as most people had no idea I had a drinking problem. I was very, very good at keeping it secret, so, most people don\u2019t think I actually ever had a problem. So, I don\u2019t get upset when my friends ask such questions.\n\nI, honestly, hadn\u2019t ever given it much thought. My fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t drink, so, being sober these last 300+ days has been relatively easy, and there\u2019s no alcohol in the house to tempt me.  It never really crosses my mind to have a drink, because I am so rarely around it. When I am around it, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not partaking, because I usually get flooded with my shameful memories. This makes it easy to go to bars, believe it or not. Kind of like, yeah, I\u2019m above that now. \n\nAnyway, since my friend mentioned moderation, I cannot get it out of my head. Thoughts of drinking have been flooding my head for days. I\u2019ve had several dreams about getting wasted on Jager, which was my drink of choice. Oddly, though, I am not craving hard liquor; I want a beer so. bad. Which is also odd because I drank hard liquor way more than I ever drank beer. However, I know if I had a beer, that would inevitably lead to shots. I know this because I never, ever just drank beer alone, and I\u2019m a creature of habit. \n\n So, last night, I couldn\u2019t sleep. My anxiety was high, and I could not stop thinking about having a drink. I kept going through my head all the reasons not to drink, but there was a voice saying, \u201cdon\u2019t rule out moderation.\u201d I couldn\u2019t get it out of my head. I decided to distract myself with Reddit, and scrolled through the most recent page. There was a picture of a man that was five days sober, so, I went to read the comment section because I needed to see some uplifting comments about being sober. I finally found a thread that had this page linked. \n\nI haven\u2019t clicked on a subreddit link faster. \n\nI searched moderation, and you people are awesome. Every single thought I had, somebody else had. Some had experimented with the thoughts. And I saw exactly what I assumed. It. Can\u2019t. Work. \n\nThe best thing I saw on here was this: imagine justifying alcohol as if it were heroin. That hit me hard. My brother is two years sober from heroin, after years of struggling to get clean. I, foolishly, didn\u2019t even consider alcohol as dangerous as heroin because it\u2019s legal. But that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t just as harmful. \n\nI woke up this morning still craving alcohol, and I was disappointed in myself, because I had gone to bed on such a high note. I got on Facebook, and I had a new message. It was from a friend telling me he was seven days alcohol free. And I thought that was something special. Then he said his problem was dealing with boredom. I told him to stop being so boring, and go do something. Then it hit me. Go do something, you goof. So, I played five hours of LEGO Star Wars. \n\nDuring this time, I talked to my fianc\u00e9 about my cravings and moderation. I told him all the advice you all had and how inspiring it was. He was getting excited for me, which got me excited. He doesn\u2019t drink, and for two years, was the only person who knew the extent of my drinking. He begged me to quit all the time, but he never left me. I was an alcoholic when we met, and all he\u2019s ever cared about is getting me to be the best BobbyKingOfHearts that I can be. We both agreed that moderation is a joke, and there\u2019s no point in even trying because I\u2019m just setting myself up for failure. The best part was that he didn\u2019t judge me for wanting to try it out, but rather, worked out with me why I was considering it, and helped weigh my options. I am grateful for having a support system. \n\nI am so glad I found this subreddit, and am grateful for people like y\u2019all. I now have a second support system. \n\nIWNDWYT",

I\u2019m grateful for those months but discouraged that when push comes to shove I choose to drink.\nWas having a mentally crappy day, didn\u2019t eat, my husband left for something last night and I knew as he closed the door to our place that I was going to drink. That was the critical moment- where I could have called someone. Instead, numb, I made a beeline for the store and bought two bottles of sparkling rose with a label called \u201cWish Flower\u201d. Pink and innocent looking. Pushed any thoughts of stopping clear out of my head, convinced myself that no one had to know, just me and lord knows I\u2019m up for carrying more shame.\nGot home and immediately popped a bottle and chugged the first 2 glasses. Who chugs wine on an empty stomach? An alcoholic. Took my two bottles to sit in front of my tv screen and played my drunk \u201cescape\u201d video game: Dragon Age Inquisition. I love being an elf. It felt great for about 20 minutes and then I don\u2019t remember much after that.\nFast forward, husband comes home and I\u2019m in bed, passed out. Apparently I tried hiding the evidence by taking the recycling out but I left our recycling bag with the two bottles. He also found a wine stopper next to me on our bed stand and my breath reeked of booze. I know, totally inconspicuous.\nHe told me to get back up on the sobriety horse and keep going. I don\u2019t know what I did to luck out being married to this man but I can\u2019t keep taking him or my life for granted. I have to keep going. Recovery is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. I will gratefully not drink with you today.",

In fact, I've actively avoided it and only associated with him when I had to because of shared family events. He's been an alcoholic for years now, it really seemed to blow up after I went away for college though. I think he couldn't handle living completely alone. He's killing himself with his drinking though. My grandmother tries to hide most of it from everyone, but her husband lets more things slip. Yesterday, I was told that things are at the point where they're expecting to just find my father dead any day now.\n\nI don't even know how to begin to feel about this. As a child, I used to wish that he would go away forever, I always thought I didn't care if he died or just disappeared. Do I suddenly care? I don't know about that either. Maybe I just feel guilty for not caring more? I definitely feel guilty while watching my grandmother suffer under the stress he's caused her. Is all of this inner turmoil just me childishly worrying that my family will judge or resent me for not mourning him properly? Or will I regret not caring about him after he's dead?\n\nSome part of me still feels like the four year old that doesn't understand why her daddy doesn't want to spend time with her. Another part of me still hates him for how he treated me for nineteen years. A lot of me thinks he deserves all of this, he's spent his whole life being a miserable waste of space and a jerk. Most of me just feels anxious about this whole thing.\n\nI don't have anyone to really talk to about this stuff, because my family gets angry at me for not being more sensitive about him. My grandmother resents me for not wanting to be around him. My friends say that it's good that he'll be gone soon, good riddance and all. My partner tells me not to worry about this stuff and just shuts any attempt of the conversation down. I don't know how to just not worry about it though. Maybe I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill, that's entirely possible.",

There\u2019s messes everywhere.  Many are projects I started and keep meaning to finish.  Taking medication seemed to help but it still doesn\u2019t help me decipher what should be done and what is a tedious waste of time.  We bought a fixer upper 6 years ago and we still have a ways to go so that adds to the chaos.  I\u2019m a hoarder.

Things are great most of the time. \n\nThe biggest issue is, he gets angry when he drinks.  Most of our fights have occurred while one of us has been drinking. I mostly drink two drinks tops, I know my limit. It\u2019s getting to the point where I think I might have to take a break from alcohol just so I don\u2019t encourage him to drink.  I barely drink to begin with, so cutting it out wouldn\u2019t be difficult for me. \n\nLast week we got into a fight while we both were drinking. It was over a joke, he thought I was making fun of him and it escalated from there. Today, I tried talking to him about it. I said \u201cI don\u2019t want to drink anymore, I don\u2019t like the people we are when we drink. We always fight and it hurts me\u201d. He was silent. \n\nEvery time he has a shitty day at work, he comes home and immediately cracks a bottle. Then he\u2019ll drink 3-4 beers and be content.  I get that we all have our \u201cvices\u201d, but it breaks my heart to see him come home and immediately start drinking. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t get drunk, he doesn\u2019t get belligerent, etc. In the two years we\u2019ve been dating, I\u2019ve barely seen him drunk.

   "selftext": "The last little while it\u2019s been really often. I decided to assess myself to find what is causing my depression lately, but in order to do that, I had to really dig deep into the root of the problem. \n\nI realized while typing this, that I\u2019ve been on my journey to recovery since November 2017. \n\nFirst I want to say that I don\u2019t go to therapy, so I just speculate a lot and rant, so there is a good chance that is what will happen. I will try to edit out unimportant ramblings. \n\nBack to my journey; I come from a large family so my siblings and I often go in on gifts for our parents in order to get them something big, so last November one of my brother\u2019s texts everyone and says we should make a video of all the kids talking about their childhood experiences.\n\nSounds cheesy, but nice right? Wrong. See a little back story on this brother tells you that he was abusive, conniving, hateful, relentless, heartless and all around terrible. As an adult, he is pretty much the same, but well read and extremely douchey. Making him much worse. \n\nAll my siblings agreed to do the video, except for me. I wasn\u2019t going to either A: tell the truth about my childhood and ruin Christmas, or B: lie and give the person who stole my childhood what he wants. I decided to make a point to not go along with what I, and come to find out all my siblings, thought was a bad idea. \n\nWell my family gave me shit for not doing it and I was even more alienated from them. I don\u2019t mind that part. They are all sort of terrible in their own way, but what did make me angry is that one of my brother\u2019s wife lied and told my family I\u2019m an alcoholic, so they all wrote these bull shit notes about how much they love me and that video made it so much worse than it needed to be. \n\nOnly problem is, if that were true, at least one of them would know I haven\u2019t had a drinking problem for about five years and the douche brother I mentioned earlier is a raging alcoholic and has been for a long time.\n\nOkay, so back to the topic of my journey; I am currently unhappy with mediocrity in my life, but am terrified of success ( for reasons I have only half way figured out) which has lead me to have suicidal thoughts regularly. \n\nI believe that depression is much like herpes, or HIV. Once you have it, you have it, but you can treat it and prevent flare ups, or spreading it to others. Right now I am unsure of what my preventative care is. I exercise, eat well, have an amazing family I made on my own. I have a good job with so much opportunity and great friends. Everything except therapy, so maybe that\u2019s ultimately what I have to do... \n\nI\u2019ve tried therapy once and it sucked, but she was clearly biased towards Mormonism, so it got me nowhere. \n\n",

   "selftext": "I was a great student in highschool, ran an ebay business, wrote essays for money, interned for an important legal place in the community, took 10 AP's and sold drugs. I got accepted into an elite school, went there for a year, and it fucked me over mentally. The summer after my first year I called out this kid for stealing and him and his friends jumped me, and the kid was a minor and his parents were rich but never paid my medical bills. To this day I have not received restitution and my parents paid it. Furthermore, a social worker at school told me to handle my substance abuse issues by admitting myself into rehab. Figured out it was very expensive, and faked myself out by discharging and saying I was off of xanax magically. I was sent to collections and have not paid them the sum of $2000 that I apparently owe them. \n\nI shrugged it off and continued school. The next fall my substance abuse got worse and my grades slipped. I got heavily into cocaine and xanax, sold it as well to maintain my habit. I was the best goddamn salesman ever, but always spent more money than I earned, treating my friends. Nobody but my roommates realized how amazing I was, the rest of the people I met in college knew me as the dude, and couldn't make the same friends I made my first year. Then I was ran over by a car my winter quarter and my leg got fucked up for a great amount of time, so I skipped class and sold drugs full time, thinking I could half ass school. I ended up having to bullshit psychological services and get permission for withdrawals, for both fall and winter, as I continuously fucked up from getting too focused on selling. So many people gave me advice on how to better myself, and shit just kept getting worse.\n\n It all started on this car ride where me and roommates rode up a highway divider as a result of the driver taking xanax and falling asleep. My addiction to xanax made me a fiend and alcoholic, since 10th grade and now in my second year I was a full fledged retard, as in I couldn't even hold down a conversation without paying attention, of course I was depressed this entire time as I had no end goal for college, stopped being the social elite I was once. I stopped being invited to parties and didn't know who was my friend because of my popularity for being the dude. Then shit changed when my house got robbed by this person who stole laptops a pound of weed all my xanax and even had the nerve to venmo himself $2000. Lost, I didn't report it to the police as I was too strung out and even more depressed, not to mention the person who did it was notorious and had warrants out, and is still currently missing, as I check his facebook and his mom doesn't even know where he is. \n\nThen, I got robbed again, by this couch surfer who was known by the local community, he also stole all the new xanax I had purchased and put me in debt with my dealer, who was also my friend, thank God he isn't evil or else I would be in some deep shit.  The dude who was his source got arrested, so I had to get out of the game. I kept getting texts by bartards, people stopped by without notice as if I was some magic xanax fairy. People even opened my door as if it was okay. I fucked up by selling out of my house. Then, evidently, my house got robbed again and someone stole a $300 JBL speaker that was borrowed from a friend and another pound of weed from my roommates. Jesus Christ, it was time to drop school and move out, either way I wasn't admitted into Spring Quarter. I had a tonsillectomy recently and my doctor fucked up by prescribing me too many antibiotics, weakening my immune system and killing all my good bacteria, and now I have the Giardia parasite in my stomach lining and feel terrible.\n\n I moved back home and went back to visit the old place as I left some stuff, and my parents came to pick me up, and was too busy getting fucked up for cinco de mayo to even pack, I took what I could, but left some valuables. Last week I lost my glasses and phone. Goddamn I feel like I failed my parents, those people love me to death and I feel like a piece of shit for asking for money to pay the rent as I moved out. I failed my bros and feel bad for the debt I have with them. The week I was there, the lady who sold me alcohol as a minor got caught selling to someone whos a minor and got fined $3000. She risked it all and got fucked. The week I was there, I tried to fight someone drunk in a restaurant, I feel bad. I found out who helped steal 100 pills with the couchsurfer, and stole his laptop as revenge, evidently the other guy who was friends with the couchsurfer was a good friend of mine and I acted 2 faced with him after I stole his phone, which contained the texts of them trying to distract me. I told his roommate that he smoked meth (as I found it in his texts he smoked it with the dude that robbed me). The kid got evicted and relocated with a mutual friend.\n\n I was so distraught, felt bad and returned his phone, but claimed I didn't know the whereabouts of his laptop. The roommate called the cops as the couchsurfer dude broke in and stole his $200 beats and I bought them for $50, but being in debt, sold them for $80, and didn't know who's they were. My conscience is killing me, as the roommate of his was a dear friend and feel like I wronged him for selling his beats, he's a good kid though and even asked me if I still had them even though I denied. He accepted it and we hungout. I even hungout with the kid who conspired and acted like we were good friends, even though I took his laptop. The couchsurfer dude is living comfortably even though he fucked me bad by putting me in debt, and threatened to call the cops on me for formerly selling drugs in high quantities and has text proof. All set aside, I am back home dealing with this shit in the back of my head, as well as the former life I've lived with all the baggage. \n\nI definitely have pissed off some people, and have definitely been wronged. Now I am stuck in debt, out of school and have no choice but to pay my debts which should have never existed in the first place. I worked so hard, just to get fucked by thieves. I now have alot of health issues, and the main one I am dealing with is severely high blood pressure. Last time I went to the docs which was a few days ago I read 164/90. Besides that, I feel like the injustice is killing me. What approach should I take to clear my head? I am severely depressed in my day to day life. I no longer contact friends from my hometown and live a reclusive life. Please help.",

   "selftext": "#[\"Love Never\" by Jimmy Eat World](https://youtu.be/mXExVFqrvgs)\n\nFor those who care to humor me for a moment, the band *Jimmy Eat World* recently released a new single, called \"Love Never\". The song is not about pornography &amp; masturbation, of course, but I like it nonetheless. The lyrics to the chorus are:\n\n&gt;It's gonna seem so far.\n\n&gt;It's gonna feel so hard.\n\n&gt;Until you want the work more than reward.\n\n&gt;Do you want the work more than the reward?\n\nSome people who are addicted to pornography &amp; masturbation are able to go through a 90 day reboot, reset their brain to its previous state, and then return to a normal, moderate relationship with pornography &amp; masturbation.\n\n**I am not one of those people.**\n\nJust like an alcoholic who understands they will never be able to safely return to drinking in moderation, I think I have finally come to terms with the reality that I will never be able to re-assume a healthy relationship with pornography or masturbation. I think I have realized that I am just one of those people who will remain addicted for the rest of his life. My streak may continue to go up and up (Lord willing, one days for years and years), but I don't think I will ever reach the point where one wrong step wont send me tumbling right back down to the pits of indulgence. This is, to be quite honest, a pretty saddening thought. We all like to think that we are running towards a finish line, and once we get there, the race will be over, and we will be able to rest. Realizing that the race will never end, that for the rest of my life I will be forever fighting, is a thought that really sucks. But those are the cards I have been dealt, and it is the reality I will accept. I refuse to give up running simply because of the fact that the race will never end. I will continue to fight for the rest of my life.\n\n#A Quick Background \n\nI am currently on day 47 of my current streak, the longest I have gone since my previous PR of 156 days in 2012. I hope to make it to 90 days again, and this time I am doing it on hard mode. If I make it to day 91, I will switch to normal mode, but continue my pursuit of remaining free of pornography &amp; masturbation. I do not plan on ever again telling myself it is \"okay to try it again\".\n\nI first realized I had an addiction to pornography &amp; masturbation in 2010. Since then, my attempts at fighting this addiction have been off and on, with more offs than ons and more failures than triumphs. Most attempts wouldn't last more than a week, and would be followed by long stretches of giving up altogether and not bothering to fight it at all for weeks or even months on end.\n\nIn 2012 I had a major breakthrough when I successfully went 156 days without pornography or masturbation. It was the first time since I first discovered masturbation in 2004 that I had gone more than 2 weeks without indulging. I made it to my goal of 90 days, was feeling great, and decided to keep going. At day 157, in a moment of weakness, I broke my streak. I thought I was cured, I thought the war was won, and I had successfully returned my life to a state where I could indulge in moderation. \"No worries, it's just one misstep. I'll go back to abstaining tomorrow,\" I thought. Oh how wrong I was.\n\nI immediately fell right back into my old ways. it was as if nothing had changed, my body and my mind instantly re-assumed their familiar addicted state. I returned to my cycle of trying every now and then: a few days here, a week there. I managed to get up to 2 weeks a couple times, and even got to about a month at one point. But any small streak would be followed by a long period of apathy and indulgence.\n\nThis is why I feel this way about my current state of addiction. It sucks, but it is something I have come to terms with. Nonetheless, I will keep fighting.\n\n#Some Other Thoughts\n\nMy brain *really* wants me to give it the dopamine hit that it craves from an orgasm. Like, **really** badly. I have had a few really strong urges in the past 47 days, and am very happy that I was able to fight those off. But even beyond that, I have noticed that my mind will quite frequently jump through hoops to try and convince itself why even a wet dream is something to look forward to. I mean, if one happens, so be it, I'm not going to fret over it or reset my counter because of it. But I realized the other day that it is silly (and dangerous) to allow myself to *look forward* to possibly having a wet dream each night. That's not a rational thought. That's my brain getting desperate, trying any crazy move it can think of to try and get that dopamine hit it craves. It is for this reason that I decided to finish the 90 days on hard mode. I think 90 days refrained from orgasm altogether will be good for me. \n\nIt does not feel like I've been at this for 47 days. It feels like 90 days should have already arrived by now. But in reality I'm only just over half way there. Which is frustrating not only because of the obvious reason (its no fun to feel like time is moving slower than it really is), but also because I know that the 90 day goal isn't the finish line. It's just a check point. A marker along the race that I need to reach, pass by, and keep going. So I'm conflicted by being frustrated that I have not yet reached the finish line, while simultaneously knowing that I shouldn't be viewing it as a finish line in the first place.\n\nWith all of this being said...I have noticed improvement. When I look back over the past years struggling with this, I see a lot of failures and a lot of very short streaks. But what I also see is that the gaps between those streaks have slowly gotten smaller. When I have a streak, it is likely to be longer now than it was when I first started. When I have a period of indulging, its likely to be shorter than it was when I first started. I take this to be a sign of progress, if ever slight, spread out over many years. If I screwed up tomorrow and indulged, my 47 day streak would be broken, and that would absolutely suck. But I'll tell you what: I bet my next 47+ day streak will arrive sooner than the previous one did. And that is what a lifetime of running the race looks like. Not constant success. But constant fighting.\n\n#In Conclusion\n\nI need to want the work more than the reward. I need to stop thinking of this struggle as something that will eventually end, and start enjoying the feeling of living in the struggle itself. Enjoy the benefits. Enjoy the progress. I shouldn't use the finish line as the motivation, because for me, the finish line doesn't exist. I must use the mental, psychological, physical, and emotional improvement as the motivation. Because of this fight I'm in, I grow stronger every day. Every day I succeed is a day I become a better person; a man who does not allow himself to be controlled by something without, but instead teaches himself to be in control of that which is within.\n\n**Do you want the work more than the reward?**",

   "selftext": "Hey reddit, lately I have been thinking a lot about my relationship with my mom and am starting to think that there might be some harmful aspects to our relationship\u2026. I\u2019m 21, I go to university in a different town and live with my mom when I visit home which is quite often. I have never seen a therapist or talked to someone about and lately I have kind of been thinking that maybe I should about my mom but not sure if my situation merits it? Any advice would be extremely appreciated..\n\nBasically, to make a long story short our family has had an pretty traumatic run. We lost both my dad and sister and now it is just me and my mom. 90% of the time, she is absolutely amazing and I love her so much, but there are some really dark things that she does (in my opinion) some of the time. I feel as though I am her punching bag a bit in life and she takes things out on me when she gets overwhelmed. For example, I can always tell when something bad happens to her (unrelated to me) like being reminded of my sister or the car breaking down that I need to be extra cautious because if I make one minor misstep (like forgetting to call her if I leave the house one night, or accidentally making a rude comment) it will turn into an extreme meltdown. For example, most recently I got rejected from a job I was really hoping for and I reacted by being a bit reclusive and not really talking (to her, or anyone). She was very supportive and echoed that she loved me for the first day and then the second day something unrelated seemed to have happened which upset her and I woke up in the middle of the night to her slamming all the doors in the house, flickering my lights on and off and screaming at the top of her lungs. I tried to ask what is wrong but she just kept telling me to \u201cgo away\u201d and \u201clet her suffer\u201d and say that I don\u2019t care about her and no one cares about her (I\u2019m assuming because I had been very distant lately as a result of my bad news). She has done similar things in the past like one time we were driving home from a road trip and in the car and she started screaming \u201cI am going to kill myself , I am going to end my life tonight, I can\u2019t wait for it all to be over\u201d \u2014 in these instances I feel very scared and guilty, wishing I hadn\u2019t done that one thing to set her off, or I initially think that something serious happened like somebody died which worries me. And the thing is, she is an extremely put together, successful person in the public but I am the only one who witnesses this dark side, which is what makes me think that I am like an outlet to her sometimes to unleash all her sadness. The \"episodes\" always involve banging things, screaming, shrieking, crying etc. at the top of her lungs and saying such catastrophized things such as having nothing to live for, me not loving her, her wanting to die.. it can last for up to an hour and I am either trying to console her while being shouted all these things about her hating her life or sitting in my room trying to drown out the sound of her shrieking. It is sometimes difficult to explain to my friends that I couldn't hang out when we had planned because my mom was going off the rail and I was too worried about her/upset to go out. I think it really upsets me because my mom is someone I idolize, she has worked so hard and is such a kind person in general and seeing her say these things about her life makes me feel a bit hopeless about my own life.\n\nShe takes everything VERY personally \u2014 simple things like disliking a movie she enjoys or if she offers to cook me something and I say \u201cno thank you, iI\u2019m trying not to eat too much sugar\u201d or whatever she will take it as a personal stab at her, especially on a bad day. And then come the meltdowns and comments such as \u201cyou don\u2019t care about me, nobody cares about me\u201d etc. The things I do to set her off are pretty typical teenage daughter things, like speaking with a rude tone of voice on occasion. She actually often tells me how great of a daughter I am and how much she appreciates me. She also has an irrational dislike of drinking.. on occasion (maybe once a week) I\u2019ll go out with some friends and not come home that night (I\u2019ll always tell her if that\u2019s the case) and she\u2019s fine with it but if I take too long to come home the next day (as in like, not right that morning) she will snap and call me an \u201calcoholic\u201d (which is funny because I actually volunteer with rehabilitating sufferers alcohol use disorder, lol) \u201cdon\u2019t care about her\u201d etc.\n\nAnyway, lately I have been feeling really depressed and I normally try to forget about these situations when they happen but I am really just starting to wonder if they might be affecting me negatively. Her personality like this has been around my whole life growing up although of course it\u2019s been worse as of late with recent events. The biggest thing is I feel so guilty even considering her as potentially \u201ctoxic\u201d because 90% of the time she is the best mom in the world, so I feel so guilty even saying this. But anyway, I was hoping to get any thoughts at all from you guys. I am feeling a little lost and I have no idea what to do! Many thanks xxx",

   "selftext": "Hello to everyone on this incredible forum. \n\nLike lots of people on here, I\u2019m sure, I feel very scared to write this. I lurked on this forum constantly about two months ago, during which time I quit drinking for around twenty days, before it all collapsed. The community here is the one of the most special things I think I\u2019ve ever seen and I\u2019m grateful for everyone out here doing what they do.  \n\nI\u2019m here because I know deep down in my heart that I have a very big drinking problem. I have tried my best to ignore it for as long as I possibly could as I work in the drinks trade \\(I am, in fact, sat within a wall of beer at work right now\\) but I am a problem drinker and there is no way for me to hide from it anymore. \n\nDrinking has been a very prominent part of my life for as long as I can remember. My dad passed away in my teens due to alcoholism. He was never really seen without a drink, although I never really considered that unusual as it was all I had known for him, and we spent many a happy weekend\\-afternoon running around beer gardens as children. My mum drinks pretty much daily, not heavily by any stretch of the imagination, but a drink at the end of a long day has been burned into my cranium as the adult treat that everyone gets to enjoy. As a teenager I started drinking relatively heavily with friends as we navigated the new pastures of being able to get past the bouncers guarding the doors of the bars and clubs in town. It was fun then, and not being able to recall the events of the previous evening was part and parcel of the experience, I thought. I noticed others not wanting to play as hard as I did, but I thought they had low tolerances and I wore my own high tolerance like a badge of honour. As I entered my twenties I continued to be the last girl standing, even if I was staggering more than standing. I started working in bars when I was in my late twenties, and arriving so late to the industry game meant that I had a lot of catching up to do. Free post\\-shift drinks were a starter pistol and I walked home as the sun came up more often than I care to remember, and often I couldn\u2019t. \n\nWhilst working in bars I met the love of my life. We were both in other relationships at the time but when we talked and got to know each other we fell more deeply in love than I had ever considered possible. Naturally, this brought an end to both of our relationships and we embarked on a love affair that has brought me joy beyond my wildest dreams. For better or for worse, though, we are both big drinkers who love nothing more than unwinding with a beautiful beer. When drinking together is good we have the time of our lives, laughing and joking and making love and seeing the world through rose\\-tinted glasses. When bad, we fight and scream until we\u2019re blue in the face, and awake the next morning hungover and regretful. \n\nI know in my heart that most of our drinking\\-related problems are caused by my inability to stop once I have started. More than that, I become deeply insecure when drunk and lash out at him because of a deep\\-seated fear that he will walk away from me. The irony of drinking myself into oblivion, and then verbally attacking my true love or at the very least needing him to walk me home as I weigh heavy on his arm so that he *doesn\u2019t* leave me isn\u2019t lost. I think often about the lust for life I gave him when I handed him my heart and then about the shattering disappointment he must feel now that he finds himself with a girl who sold him a lie. Because when we fell in love we stayed up until dawn drinking, but that was supposed to end. We were supposed to build a life together and clean up our act and whilst he does everything he can to live a clean and healthy life, he is brought back down by me and my insatiable thirst. I am his enabler, and all I ever wanted to do was nurture him; like pouring a pint of beer on a houseplant then stubbing a cigarette end out in the soil.\n\nLast night we met up for drinks after a very stressful day. My boy has gone away today for the weekend, so goodbye drinks seemed like the perfect way to spend the evening. With empty stomachs we charged forth, which lead to heated bickering and soon arguing. Bowing under the weight of the day\u2019s earlier struggles, I turned to my glass instead of my boy for comfort. I soon lapped him and when his frustrations rightly got the better of him he stood up to leave. Four or five pints had unshackled my inhibitions and I grabbed him and flailed at him and tried to stop him from walking away. He pushed me off and because I had drank so much I fell to the floor and into a group of people. He left and I cried on the shoulder of a person with a face I can\u2019t recall. I stumbled off on a fifteen minute walk that must have taken thirty and when a car drove by and offered to take me home I did the stupidest thing I have ever done and got in. When I woke up I knew I was technically safe and unharmed, despite not recalling much of anything since I had fallen. I have done this enough to know how to reassure myself. My things were there, my keys and my clothes, I checked my body for bruises, but I don\u2019t know how to check how much damage I did to my soul, or how to check my boy\u2019s heart so that I can see for myself that there\u2019s no crack down the centre because of me. \n\nStill slightly drunk, we argue. Even now in the late afternoon my recollection of the morning is hazy. I\u2019ve long suffered with checking behaviours related to OCD and although therapy has helped to curb them, enduring blackouts as often as I do wreaks havoc on my mental health. I fill in all the black spots in my memory with wild, overly\\-imaginative, sometimes laughable, often terrifying, scenarios. As my boy packed his bags for the trip we found a way to make up and have both vowed to end this once and for all. Although I would instantly take back last night if I could, a part of me is grateful that it happened because if that\u2019s my wake\\-up call then I will consider myself to have gotten off lightly. \n\nAn AA meeting takes place in a few hours right around the corner and I am mustering up the courage to attend. I\u2019m scared and I might not go today but that\u2019s okay because I can and will go when I am ready. With my boy away I plan on going to my mums for a couple of nights and taking solace in the comfort of home and when he gets back on Monday we can start our sober life together.\n\nThank you for reading this and IWNDWYT.

   "selftext": "So let me give some background, I\u2019m 16 my friend (who\u2019s name is cj) is 16 as well. Cj has had a bit of a rough life, his dad is an alcoholic, and his mom is too wrapped up in work and supporting the family to care. Cj plays hockey, and loves playing video games with our group of friends (who I will name later). Hockey has odd scheduling so Cj finds himself at practices usually until midnight or one in the morning on school nights. Recently Cj got out of a very promiscuous relationship that was causing him to self harm because his girlfriend was cheating on him very frequently. Because his girlfriend slept around, Cj has had rumors of him being a practical male prostitute spread about him. Because of this, he has found finding another relationship to prove quite difficult. Well he succeed, with this girl who\u2019s name is Peyton. Peyton wants to love Cj, but finds it hard because of all of these nasty rumors that are said about him and in turn is mentally abusing Cj without even realizing. This has a severe negative effect on cj\u2019s mental health. Recently (4-5 months ago) cj\u2019s mother was hospitalized and had emergency surgery for an issue that I am not aware of. Cj\u2019s Mom was given oxycodone (that\u2019s how you spell it right?) as a pain reliever, which she still takes to this day. However, Cj has been stealing his mother\u2019s pills and replacing them with look-alikes and using the opiates for his own personal, recreational use. This was caused by a wonderful man named Cody-who as far as I\u2019m aware is a pill junkie-who convinced Cj that stealing oxycodone from his mother and snorting them for his own good, would be the best decision he\u2019s ever made. Reality check: it wasn\u2019t. In this recent spell of about 5 months, Cj has began to battle a serious depression, came off and then went right back on oxycodone, has forced himself to stay in this mentally abusive relationship-to prove an unnecessary point that he doesn\u2019t date girls for sex-and has had no more than 5 hours of sleep a night, because of his schedule with hockey, and his addiction. I have seen pictures of Cj with a gun in his mouth and suicide notes he has written. (I kept his Snapchat streaks for a short while and they were in his memories) Recently, me and my friends: Mike and Jonah, have really tried to get through to Cj, because he is now speaking of doing Xanax along with all of the other shit he is currently doing: Acid, Oxy, and shrooms. We have tried to emphasize the dangers of addiction and warn him that the next step would be heroin (which is basically a ticking time bomb before overdose) Cj becomes combative when we talk to him about this, claims that he has overdosed before, he knows his limits, that we don\u2019t know the difference between heroin and oxycodone, and we are just being Debbie-downers and don\u2019t know how to have fun. However, it\u2019s more than that, the county I live in has an over dose death rate of 42 per 100K. One of the highest in the country. I really don\u2019t want to see one of my best friends turn down a dark path and be gone forever. I don\u2019t want him to become another statistic for the CDC to publish, but most certainly I don\u2019t want to estrange him by my ant-drug rhetoric. (I am not against marijuana use, but hard drugs are a different story) However, I feel it is important to pound this information into his head, because he doesn\u2019t get it, and is really living like he\u2019s invincible at this point. Sadly, I\u2019m not getting through to him, and I\u2019ve reached my wits end, I don\u2019t want to have to bury my friend before he even graduates. Please help me here, I\u2019m really in a pickle.

   "selftext": "for the past several years i have climaxed in my problematic drinking patterns. to a point where every root issue i have needed to heal from, has come to the forefront/ intrinsically tied to my relationship with alcohol. i am queer/fem/NB/ social justice motivated/ half white/ white passing. i'm not sure how safe this sub reddit is and i just want to create a trigger warning / if being queer and political is a red flag for you/ please just respect my need in finding support too. last september, i started my journey into alcohol sobriety at the same time that i started a deep accountability process for my harmful past behaviour. the two seemed to need to go together hand in hand. turning to alcohol/ substance abuse while having PTSD/ being marginalized/ seemed justifiable at the time. i no longer share that framework. i hold a very critical self image/ and battle with self hate/ self sabotage. but i do not want to point fingers or cast shame on anyone who presently drinks or numbs out.  'things' have to click for people before hard self work can be done. and thats clearly harder for those on the margins/ in poverty/ who are poc/ indigenous/ queer/ etc. i am often motivated by my own belief system, for a while i believed abstinence wasnt a practical outlook for me. my daily life and interactions have so much to do with holding space for other peoples trauma. having grown up with abusive/ drug addict parents/ have 3 alcoholic - drug addict sisters/ and a myriad of friends who have died from heroin/ suicide/ i found myself very terrified of feeling impervious. which is something i think about a lot. my mom told me that when she quit doing heroin/ a lot of her old friends confronted her with hostility/ shaming her for her hard self work. which makes sense when you feel left behind and like healing is a weapon used against you. its sad how complex addiction really is. i believed that my relationship with alcohol needed to be met with truly understanding why i was so untrustable while drinking? what my motivations and intentions really are? and if it was possible to enter a world of moderation/ or ritual based drinking. for example/ harvesting berries/ making wine and drinking it like once or twice a year. something like that. what i have realized is that sobriety is excruciating/ its so much about embracing the mundane. staying present/ doing self work/ being accountable for the way i treat my body. the few times i have stepped into my idea of moderation/ i have been left with the same self hate and emptiness/ even if i didnt behave badly or obscene. i currently am practicing total abstinence from alcohol, bc i feel its the only way to overcome the spiritual disease that comes with alcohol addiction. since it really clicked for me that moderation wasnt an option/ i can now go to social events and interact with people. dance/ and feel reassured knowing i will not be problematic. having special NA beverages helps but i dont want to rely on that. i honestly dont know anyone who is tackling d.i.y alcohol sobriety without things like kratom, weed, or la croix. i really believe plants can help with addiction and that is why some of them are here. however, im afraid of trading one for the other. though, thats how it works sometimes. i do not think healing/ or sobriety is linear. some days, i feel totally back at square one. alcohol has been part of our lives throughout history in deep ways. strange ways. harmful ways. when life gets unbearable it makes itself very available. quitting alcohol hasnt validated me as a person in this world and in some ways people i have really topsy turvy relationships with in the past/ still come for me whenever the f they want. sometimes its warranted and sometimes it feels malicious. what i have learned is that all of our behaviour is visible/ and until you really commit to self work and start doing it/ you remain suspicious to others who are willing to hold you accountable (it works both ways). this has inspired me to address \n all of my issues like: rage/ and defense mode. if i can put my hands in the air and be like, youre right, i was wrong, i participated in harm/ it doesnt mean i need to be cast out of society. then we can start to grow and ultimately heal. im writing this post to share that ive discovered a less individualistic outlook since quitting alcohol. i believe our common suffering is more linked than i have felt before in the past. ive actually found so much support through 12 step programs/ meetup groups/ just relating based off of extricating this substance which i feel is so demonic. i encourage those who have taken the steps to heal from alcohol addiction to also confront deeper root issues and to be truly accountable. bc thats all we can really do, is be totally responsible for our actions and start to change the cycles that are ready to trap us through loops over and over again.",

   "selftext": "I'm not sure why I'm surprised by this, but when speaking to people they normally don't seem to \"get\" how bad depression is. Or, at least, they don't get how bad MY depression is. I'm not so sure how widespread this is, but talking to someone just doesn't seem to cut it in my experience. I have a therapist, and I went back to the same one I had last year. Before the second appointment I mentioned to someone who PM'd me this and they suggested I write a list and add to it as time goes on. Just observations about myself and my situation as they come to me. I wrote up 5 different things, printed it out, and gave it to my therapist. \n\nI've seen her for a while now, and when she read the list she was shocked. Mind you, this was nothing new. I've already talked about all this with her. But something about reading it in writing seemed to make it click. I'm sharing my list here below, anyone who doesn't want to read it please skip by. I advise anyone who doesn't feel like their doctor is taking them seriously, maybe put your feelings in writing.\n\n1.\tI\u2019m suicidal. I\u2019ve been suicidal off and on since I was 15. I was told it was hormones when I had my first depressive episode and was not taken seriously by the school counselor.\n2.\tI have never made an actual attempt on my life, but I fantasize about it just about every day, and have since my first episode. The closest I got was when I lost my job back in 2010. I stood in my kitchen with a long knife and just blanked out and stared at it. I knew my husband would be violent and unsympathetic, I felt worthless, so I kept looking at the knife. Our alcoholic roommate was the one who took it from me and reassured me that things would be ok. My husband responded by saying if I did cut myself, I wouldn\u2019t be able to get another job due to the scars. \n3.\tI don\u2019t have a support group. I don\u2019t have a security net. My family is scattered, some in SC, the others in the area are those I don\u2019t talk to and have nothing in common with. My friends are fickle, and when I talk to them they respond with lines that just sound placating. I hear what they say, but it sounds false. I don\u2019t actually think they care. I don\u2019t actually think my family cares. I can go weeks to months between talking to anyone, depending on if they reach out to me first or not. I\u2019ll usually respond if they reach out or ask a question, but often when I do the same they either don\u2019t get back to me or something comes up. They could be automated bots on Facebook at this point, for all I know.\n4.\tWhen I go to bed, most nights I think that I don\u2019t want to wake up. Sleeping is getting to be, day by day, the only thing I look forward to. \n5.\tWhen I hit a stressed point, my anxiety and stress levels persist and increase, usually for days afterwards, and do not subside until a panic attack occurs, or something similar (crying fit, a rare laughing fit, sudden mental black-out) and is usually followed up by severe exhaustion and flu-like symptoms (sans fever). The only mental black-out I recall happening ended up with me snapping out of the state I was in to find myself shaving my head in the bathroom. I don\u2019t remember if something caused it, but I was in a depressive state at the time.\n6.\tI\u2019m often terrified of leaving the house. I try to delay things, such as grocery shopping, doctors\u2019 appointments, outings, until I\u2019m in dire need of an item or in a situation where I can put it off no longer. I\u2019m equally terrified of driving, but can usually use music to help calm me down while driving (had two severe accidents in the past and have severe issues driving long distances).\n7.\tMy husband is emotionally abusive. He\u2019s attacked me verbally multiple times in the past. Any time he is aggravated I immediately shut down. Any time anyone around me gets aggravated or aggressive, I shut down. My job depends on me keeping a level head while dealing with difficult customers. Shutting down is not an option for me, so I\u2019m worried that this will start effecting my new job. \n8.\tI\u2019m terrified of being homeless, to the point that panic attacks are common when I think about my finances, work, career prospects, and housing situation. I do not yet have my finances in control enough to live on my own. The situation is being worked on and is slowly getting better as time goes on. It just doesn\u2019t feel fast enough for me, and I feel as though I\u2019m trapped.\n9.\tI turn 34 this year. This will be 10 years I\u2019ve been with an emotionally abusive, mentally unstable drug addict. I remember there were good times but all I see are the bad ones now. I\u2019ve wasted a decade of my life with someone who refuses to grow up and continues to be unable to act like a functional adult. He\u2019s nearly 40, yet will dress like a raver kid half his age. He does nothing around the house cleaning wise save for the rare things here and there when it seems to bug him. I feel like I pick up after a toddler 90% of the time.\n10.\tI\u2019m constantly afraid. From when I wake up, to the moment I go to sleep, I\u2019m constantly terrified. Half the time, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m afraid of specifically. The only time I can escape this is when sleeping, playing video games, and occasionally when I get focused on what I\u2019m doing at work. However, this is not always a guarantee, and sometimes even during these activities I\u2019ll be feeling sensations of panic, worry, fear, and have an intense urge to hide.\n11.\tI can no longer stand physical touch. This isn\u2019t just from my husband, it\u2019s a general disgust and repulsion now, though much stronger when it comes to him. I don\u2019t like the idea of shaking hands, hugging, or casual touches. I end up having a tingling sensation when I do, which I believe is entirely in my head, and is like the sensation I get in my hands before I have a panic attack. I tense up immediately and freeze like I\u2019m under attack. When it\u2019s my husband doing this, I want to scream, react violently, or just in general lash out and I end up feeling sick. He has been initiating contact (kisses and groping) almost daily since we moved to the new apartment, after months of no physical contact. I have no idea what changed, but desperately wish he would stop touching me. I know I can\u2019t say anything, however, without causing him to freak out.\n12.\tMy husband \u201cghosted\u201d me during our first time intimate together (removed the condom without telling me). He did so to \u201cprove a point\u201d, stating that he couldn\u2019t actually feel much when wearing it. At the time I did not feel this to be a violation, but after looking back and through the horrified reactions of my friends hearing this, I\u2019ve felt violated about this more and more often as I think on it. He\u2019s also repeatedly touched me in manners where I\u2019ve told him to stop, only to have him continue a few days later. Save for the first scenario, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve been raped, but I do feel physically violated by the later actions.\n13.\tI often don\u2019t see the point in continuing to live. This usually happens during very dark periods when my thoughts turn towards suicide scenarios (no plans to do it, just general thoughts about it). When I think about leaving my husband, the hardships this will involve are the first things that come to mind. I don\u2019t make enough to live on my own (or with a roommate) and still pay bills. This increases my fear of being homeless, which usually triggers my anxiety. The threat of physical violence from him is also there, considering all his prior actions over the course of our marriage and even before. \n__________________________________________\n\nThat's just what I've written so far. Some of the last few have come up recently and were surprises to me. The constantly being afraid one was something I just realized just about a week ago. The whole \"ghosted\" thing was brought up by one of my friends when I got the rare occasion to hang out with her. She mentioned that this could be considered rape in some circles, but at the time it happened I didn't think it was much of a big deal. I was head over heals for this guy, so at the time I wasn't bothered. But when I stopped to think about it ... yeah, I have no idea why I wasn't bothered by it before. I feel like a moron, to be honest.\n\nSorry if all this is TMI. But, writing everything on this list and showing it to my therapist (even though I only had 5 points on this) seemed to be a bit of a wake up call for her. Not that she wasn't taking me seriously before, but I don't think she realized just how bad this was. She seemed rather shocked when she read through it. ",

My mom wanted to come visit me and I was excited because I love my mom so much, but she insisted on bringing my sister which I begged her not to do because unlike my mom who is okay with (not really since she cries to me about it constantly) my sister screaming at her, hitting and biting her, demanding that her food be cooked a certain way, making messes and being a general bitch, I'm not, I don't like to be screamed at, I don't like my things wasted, I don't like seeing my mom treated like shit, I don't let people hit me. \n\nSo they came and from the moment they got here my sister has acted psychotic, I have held my tongue for my mom's sake but I felt like a prisoner in my own home. Today I was trying to get into my kitchen to get a cup and my sister was in there with the fridge open, I said excuse me and instead of just letting me through she slammed my fridge door so hard that she broke two glass milk bottles and a bottle of ketchup which started leaking out of the fridge. I told her that she needed to clean that up and treat my things with respect, so she spat in my face and then picked up a broken glass milk bottle and hit me with it, I'm not going to allow that so I grabbed her arm and squeezed her wrist so that she would drop the bottle, and yes I called her a psycho bitch.\n\nMy mom started screaming that I'm attacking her, and as soon as let go of her she started hitting me and biting me, so I told her that I'm calling the cops, then she started punching herself in the face and said that if the cops come she'll tell them that I hit her. I told her that she was crazy and that I'm not mom and I'm not going to put up with her shit in my house, she went to hit me again and I pushed her away from me, I'm much bigger than her and used my strength this time and she went stumbling back and knocked into my mom, and my mom fell and hit her head on the corner of the table. I ran over to my mom and tried to help her, asked her if she was okay and she started screaming at me and telling me that I always start trouble and that this is my fault because I wouldn't leave my sister alone, so I went away. I said that my sister can't be here anymore because I'm not going to be treated like this in my own house and then my mom smacked me across the face and basically pushed me into my bedroom (I wouldn't hit her back or put my hands on her), my sister knocked over my television and my fridge, took my carton of cigarettes off of the table and put them in the sink so that $70 worth of cigarettes were ruined and then my mother packed their stuff while comforting my sister like she was a victim of terrible abuse when I've spent the last week walking on eggshells and being treated like dirt.

   "selftext": "I've been depressed for as long as I remember. then in my early twenties the crushing anxiety started on top of it and things have been pretty bad ever since. a year or so ago I started Wellbutrin, and it has helped a little, I think, but I am numb. I lack energy most of the time and lack the motivation to do what I need to do, and the only reason I do anything is out of anxiety that I need to do it or should do it. Because not doing it makes me feel worse about myself.. But this is different from a desire to do it. The existential dread I feel everyday is just this weight I drag around. Nothing means anything. Nothing matters. I don't want to commit suicide, not at the moment, but I am always wondering what the point of living is. I don't enjoy life; I tolerate it. Of course there are some moments I enjoy, but they are rare \\(like beautiful landscapes, interacting with animals, etc.\\).\n\nI am reasonably successful at my job and what I do. but I am not the best, and part of the reason I am not the best is that my depression keeps me from advancing. Part of my job requires social energy and I have none of that because of depression. And then I spend hours too anxious or overwhelmed by the thought of working on my novel to work on it, and as time ticks by and my peers and friends work and advance I remain at a standstill. and part of the reason for this is that I am usually feeling completely numb. the only thing that seems to break me out of that rut of numbness is drinking alcohol before I work on it. The emotions come back and the words flow more smoothly. but then I begin the next day even more depressed than before, realizing how sad it is to get drunk alone and use alcohol this way, to \"break through,\" and worried that I am going to be an alcoholic like my father. But without the alcohol the process is stilted, and I have to drag the work out of me, and it comes out cold and distant. Because I am not present in the world. I always feel like I am outside of my body somehow, like half of my self is trapped behind a barrier and I just can't connect to what I'm doing.\n\nI finally started seeing a therapist last week and I almost started crying while talking to him about my life. I don't think anyone in my life realizes how fucked up I am because I don't share it with them like that. but I also know that people have said of me, after meeting me briefly through friends, that I \"seem sad.\" So I wonder how obvious it really is, if they know how awful I feel all the time. I have little self\\-esteem and so any rejections or errors or medicore performances make me feel that my imposter syndrome is not a syndrome, that I really am an imposter and that is why I keep getting rejected. That I am nothing, because without this work I have nothing. I am in my mid\\-thirties and have nothing else but this work to define my life.\n\nAnd my sexuality is all messed. I fantasize about being treated terribly by men in bed\\-\\-men who have either sexually assaulted me or who have treated me poorly in the past, men in authority positions who have previously condescended to me and have power over my job, money, or career... I have no attraction to normal, nice guys... this all feels part of a self\\-destructive pattern and I don't know how to change it.\n\nI'm wondering if I need to up the dose of Wellbutrin, but I am already taking 150 SR 2x a day. I just don't know what to do to get out of this rut and less numb so I can be productive instead of sitting for hours on the internet, losing time and worrying about how I'm not being productive. I guess part of the reason I wrote out this post was so I could feel something.",

I keep a 40 in the fridge,  and if i wake up after violent nightmares at 2am,  I slam it so I can pass back out.   Sometimes if i have many triggers in a day and my anxiety is crazy,  ill slam one to go to sleep. \nDoctor gave me anxiety pills which i used in the same manner,  but they are worse for my stomach believe it or not. \nI never drink for fun or in public because that causes major anxiety for some reason,  but i don't hide the fact i do it. \nTLDR, I want to switch from pills or alcohol to cannabis,  which has recently been legalized in my area.   Smoking sometimes makes my anxiety worse.   Especially around people I don't know well. \nGood idea?  Bad idea?  Best way to take it for anxiety?

I even majored in Psychology in college and graduated with a senior thesis focusing on alcoholism. \n\nI am probably no different than any of you.  But I am here to get your support.  I am a 30 year old man, engaged to a wonderful, supportive woman who means everything to me.  We want to have a family and grow old together.

I have agoraphobia.  I work in a job that doesn't fulfill me.  I don't have friends. My family is dysfunctional.  Alcohol is merely a byproduct of a very broken life.\n\nI want to put this message out there.   I need help.  I need support.  I need encouragement.  I need to hear other people's stories.   I keep going back and forth from abstinence to binging and its killing me.   I want to be myself again.  I have quit for long periods of time before.  I have moderated before.  I know that alcohol is just the way I choose to handle stress.  When I am in a position where I am happy and content with life alcohol is a non-factor.\n\nWhat worked for you?  I know from my education and experience that there is no one size fits all answer for this problem.  But I desperately need advice.  I have so much to live for.   Yet I am going back again to addictions that hurt me in the long term.  I can't stand the man I am right now.\n\nThanks for listening",

   "selftext": "Please can I just have some advise or hear what other people out there think?  \n\nI never drank until I was 21 and was not into partying in college. When I started drinking more with my boyfriend (now husband), alcohol became something exciting and new and feeling drunk or buzzed was fun. Eventually, if I drank, I would want to do it for the purpose of feeling the alcohol even if it was only three and it was usually when we were with other people who were also drinking or if my husband and I were at home having some beers. \n\nMy husband started telling me that I had a problem and for many reasons (he can be very controlling in many aspects of our life and it is stressful), I got tired of feeling like he was always monitoring (picking up my can to see how full it was, giving me looks if I drank too fast, asking how many I had, etc.) how much I drank and so I started to be secretive; like taking a beer from the back of the fridge or not letting him see that I was in my third beer instead of my first. Sometimes I even thought it was exciting to sectretly drink and I would buy two or four drinks at the store and drink them before I got out of the car at home. \n\nWhen I became pregnant, It was easy to not drink at all, but when I came home from the hospital, my mom had bought me a bottle of champagne to celebrate. I knew my husband would disapprove because we were already having issues with him being so controlling of every little thing that had to do with how I took care of the baby. But when my sisters came to visit, they wanted to open the bottle and I just wanted to have a glass to celebrate having a new baby and felt like it was ok since I had plenty of milk pumped to give him a bottle. But my husband got so mad and it made me feel like a trashy parent even though my sisters thought he was overreacting. \n\nThat is just one instance if how I feel that he was overreacting to something that other people have told me is no big deal. Since then, my secretive drinking gradually got worse as I did it more often and I know that that is a problem.\n\nI am just struggling with this whole thing because I don't like when he calls me an alcoholic (maybe I don't like the label) and other people have told me that my behavior (not the secretive drinking but drinking to feel the alcohol) is not alcoholism and they have told me that it is ok to want to drink and to sometimes get drunk. I don't know if I became a secretive drinker because my husband is super controlling or not, but I do know now that it is a problem and I don't want to ruin my family or my marriage. I would rather quit drinking than continue to have these fights with my husband and also to not let my drinking problem get worse which I am choosing to do, but I am frustrated because I feel invalidated that his controlling behavior had anything to do with it. However, I am not trying to find someone to blame for my behavior. \n\nIt will be hard during the moments when I am with family and friends and they are drinking and having fun and I will have to be sober because I just think it is fun. \n\n",

For years I felt like I was the reason we're poor and that's why I never asked for anything even if it was a necessity.

I had been dating the same woman for 6 years, high school sweet hearts. She truly became a part of my world. And at the time I was undiagnosed depressive/bi-polar, so sometimes wasn\u2019t the most level headed and it took a toll on our relationship. Anyways I had been saving up for a while and planned to propose to her on our anniversary. Two weeks before this she came over and sat quietly. \nFinally she broke the silence and told me she had been seeing another man. She no longer loved me and hated who I had become. Needless to say this destroyed my world entirely. I became a pit of alcoholism and regular and some not so nice establishments. My downward spiral ended with a failed suicide attempt the left me in the hospital for three weeks. While I was in there, I had someone sneak in a phone so I could reach out to her for some semblance of support( because until this point she was the only person I could speak to about how I was feeling). All I got in response was \u201c take care of yourself, you\u2019ll be fine\u201d. \nFast forward a couple years and now I\u2019ve rebuilt myself. I haven\u2019t had a relationship last more than 4 months because I can\u2019t truly trust anyone the way I did back then. Besides that I\u2019ve become fairly successful in my professional life with my personal taking a back burner approach. ( not much of a choice when you don\u2019t feel like you can connect on a personal level)\nWell today I ran into a friend of mine who is a mutual friend of hers. He happened to mention in passing that she\u2019s getting married in a couple months. \nAll these wounds I thought I\u2019ve closed, things i thought I\u2019ve forgotten, feelings I\u2019ve abandoned, have suddenly came rushing back. I\u2019ve been curled up sobbing in my apartment for hours and I just don\u2019t know what to do. Is this normal? Am I overreacting? Like I haven\u2019t spoken to her in god knows how long and yet this tiny tidbit of information has put me in a state I can\u2019t even begin to describe. \nIf anyone has some advice or encouragement I could use a little right now.\n\nThanks ",

   "selftext": "There may be some offensive and upsetting things in this, I apologize now if anyone is bothered by anything I write. The events in this were several years ago, and I am just telling what happened.\t\n\nI\u2019m an alcoholic that is now sober, and my counselor said I need to start processing through my life experiences in a healthy way. Since I used to cope by drinking or substance abuse, she suggested a few healthy ways normal people cope. One of the ideas she had was for me to write little snippets, like journal entries almost, that talk about whatever is on my mind when I get lost in my head. She said it would be good for me to get feedback on them as well, but given the nature of my experiences the last few years, they aren\u2019t really things I want like say, my family to read, since they lived through it too. My girlfriend kind of understands but she has the attention span of a gold fish, and all of my friends either moved away, or just don\u2019t really have much to do with me anymore. It\u2019s like when you get sober, all of your friends just POOF, and are gone. Which brings me to\u2026 here. She said she didn\u2019t know about \u201cthe internet and those new chat doohickeys you young people use,\u201d but she said it sounded like a good place to share things, as long as it got me working through the memories and kept me from wallowing in negative emotions. So sorry for the long intro, but this is my first post so buckle up.\n\nA few years ago I had dropped out of school and was working on an assembly line in my hometown. I was semi-dating a girl who lived about an hour and a half away, and since we didn\u2019t get weekends off, I would try to find someone to cover my shift and I would go see her Friday nights. At this point everyone knew me and I could probably name from memory all 2,100 employees so most of the time I could get at least a half day off. The way the assembly line was set up, you had four or five people inside a controlled environment room doing the actual assembly, and then usually two or three people outside the room running the machines that drilled out the metal blanks and then chromed them. Since it was a seven days a week, 12 hour shift operation, we would get a lot of call-ins, people quitting mid-shift, people getting fired for cussing the supervisor, etc. Since I had been there about a year at this point I knew every station, so I was a floater. That basically meant they assigned me to a permanent station that wasn\u2019t important, so when people didn\u2019t show up they could have me fill in for them until they got a replacement. \n\nThe chrome plating took two guys to run, and you ran your ass off. At least, until the plater decided it needed a break and would error out, then you got a few minutes of down time to sit down by the fan and shoot the shit. One of the guys was sick, so they put me out on plater to fill his place. We had a temporary associate that was fairly new out there so when the plater crashed, I pulled up a crate in front of the fan and we started some small talk. Eventually the topic of women came up, and I mentioned I was seeing a nurse a few towns over. As it turns out, he had some people in the same city she was in, and asked me if he paid for half of the gas, could he go with me after work. \n\nI pretty much was green as can be to the dangers of the world, so I agreed. The plan was I would drop him off at his \u201ccousins\u201d house, I would go see my lady friend, then whenever I was done, I\u2019d go pick him up and we would head back home. It seemed a bit strange to me, but I drove an old Chevy truck at the time, so if he was going to pay for half of the gas, I could care less what his business out there was, he was saving me 30 dollars a week. \n\nWhen Friday finally rolled around I told him I was leaving at two (pm. since this was third shift), and I would wait until he got off at 3. My town quits serving liquor at 10 so I would always run out to the store on my first break, which meant by the time he got out at 3, I was halfway through the fifth I had under my seat. I saw him exit the building, so I poured the last half in a Speedway cup and tossed the bottle in the back as I started the truck. \n\n\u201cSo, where exactly do you need to go? I\u2019m not real familiar with the roads down there, I just know the general area around my girl\u2019s house.\u201d I said. \n\n\u201cNo problem man, I used to live there, so once we get off the highway, I can direct you. Hey nice mirror.\u201d He said and he laughed a little. He was pointing at the bandanna I had hanging off the rear-view. It was a rebel flag design. My new friend was a tad darker complected.\n\n\u201cSorry man, I promise I\u2019m not an asshole or anything, here I\u2019ll take it down,\u201d I started, but he laughed again and told me it was OK. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all good man, I seen you at work, I know your good people.\u201d He answered, \u201cbesides man, you said your girl\u2019s name is Kieara, come on dog, I know she ain\u2019t white, so I know you ain\u2019t gonna judge.\u201d \n\nHe smiled a bit and leaned back in his seat. \n\n\u201cI grew up further south than this dog, I\u2019ve seen it at it\u2019s worst, and you don\u2019t strike me as the type man. You seem like good people.\u201d\n\nI relaxed a little when he said this. He seemed like a nice enough guy and I didn\u2019t want him to feel uncomfortable but he assured me again that I was fine and not to worry about it. \n\n\u201cHey man, you have an aux cord in here?\u201d He asked. I laughed when he asked that. \u201cNo man, this truck is 20 years old, just be glad the airbags are still good; well, as far as I know.\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cbut hey, I have this thing that goes in my tape player that has a cord you can play your phone through.\u201d I reached down and tried to find it under the seat. One thing I loved about that truck was I could basically use the space under the seats as a storage unit. \n\nI told him to play whatever he wanted. He said \u201cyour truck, your rules man,\u201d so I asked him what he liked. He said he had a play list on Pandora of everything from rap to country, to rock. I was feeling a bit more comfortable now since we had A LOT of the same tastes in music, so we started to talk a little less reservedly about our lives to each other. That\u2019s when he said something that worried me.\n\n\u201cWhen you drop me off man, I\u2019m gonna tell you to turn down XXXXX street, when you do man, you gotta turn out your headlights, and just lay back in the seat so nobody see you, I\u2019m gonna run in, but you keep the truck running and locked. I need you to watch for me, if I come out running you open the door and we bounce, but if it\u2019s all good, I\u2019ll flip the porch lights on and you can go man.\u201d\n\nI thought for a minute and then asked, \u201csooooo\u2026 What exactly are you worried about not going well?\u201d \n\nHe sighed and paused a minute before saying that he couldn\u2019t tell me yet. He said I seemed like good people, but he hadn\u2019t quite got a read on me yet, so he would need to get to know me better before he would decide if he could tell me or not. \n\nI shrugged and said, \u201cyour business is your business man, I\u2019m not gonna pry.\u201d but on the inside I felt suspicious. At this point in time I hadn\u2019t been out of school very long, and I grew up in a very religious family, on an Air Force base, so the thought of crime didn\u2019t even cross my mind. Actually, I kinda thought his \u201ccousin\u201d was either code for him being secretly gay, or what he called his mistress so his wife didn\u2019t get suspicious. So I shrugged it off. He can do what he wants with his body.\n\nThe ride there was pretty uneventful. Once we got there, everything went just like he said. I dropped him off and waited, once I saw that the porch lights were on, I went on to see Kieara. I spent probably close to two hours with her. She also worked nights and would find someone to cover her shift too, so she didn\u2019t mind staying up until five in the morning with me. When I went back to pick up my new friend, I realized I didn\u2019t have his number and I didn\u2019t want to walk up to the door in case I had the wrong house, so I decided that I would just park out front, and eventually he would look out and see me sitting there. \n\nSure enough, he must have been just staring at the street because as soon as I pulled up he came strolling out carrying one of those felt bags like the kind they put fancy wine in. \n\n\u201cSo it is a lover.\u201d I thought. Explains the secrecy. \n\nHe waved behind him and he leaned in the window to tell me his brother was gonna ride back with us if that was OK. I told him that was fine and I secretly wondered if his \u201cbrother\u201d was actually his date the wine was for, but I kept that thought to myself. I looked up to the house and as the door opened I saw what looked like a shorter version of Dwayne \u201cthe rock\u201d Johnson come out. I stared for a moment as this hulking mass of a man walked down to the truck. \n\n\u201cHey man, good to meet you I\u2019m xxxxxx\u201d He said and held out his hand.\n\nI shook it and returned the hello. The two of them got in and we headed back home. \n\nNeither of them spoke much until we got on the highway. Just as I took the on-ramp, my friend unbuckled and crawled over the console into the back bench seat. The two of them started to undo the wine bag and whispered. I, not one to snoop, just turned the radio up a bit. \n\n\u201cno, no man, he\u2019s cool\u201d one said.\n\n\u201chow do you know though bro\u201d\n\n\u201c...serious time if...\u201d\n\n\u201cOK., you do it\u201d\n\nThey stopped whispering and my friend asked me if I smoked. I told him I didn\u2019t mind a little green sometimes and they looked at each other. For a brief minute I thought I had assumed wrong. I had, but not in the way I had thought. \n\n\u201cNo man, like, like one of these.\u201d He said as he pulled out what looked like a skinny light bulb from his pocket. \n\n\u201cIs that a bong?\u201d I said, feeling my face betray my embarrassment for not knowing. \n\n\u201cNah man. Here, try this.\u201d He reached his arm up and told me to smell what he had pinched between his fingers. I pondered for a moment, but as a drunk\u2019s reasoning goes, eh, what the hell. I snorted in and as I did, I felt a burning, sort of like when you get water up your nose at the pool, only it was immediately followed by a rush so strong I felt like my head was going to shoot off like a rocket and my eyes would explode while my brain dried. \n\n\u201cThat's GREAT! What is it!?\u201d\n\nHe smiled and told me he would explain once we got back to town. \n\n\u201cFor now,\u201d he said, \u201cenjoy the rush.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t come down for a year and a half. \n\nIt\u2019s late here, and that\u2019s a story for another time.",

   "selftext": "Had someone told me two years ago that I could be almost 10 months without drinking I would've seen that as an incredible feat. And it is that, of course. But it is also so... normal, I guess. And therein lies an issue I've found quite challenging - being alone.\n\nI don't mind it though, and generally really need it in order to recharge being more introverted and working in a highly social profession. However, since adolescence I pretty much suffered from fear of social situations and learned to be social with alcohol - it was common where I live to get buzzed and/or drunk during weekends, and in my twenties after work etc etc. Basically I socialized my formative adult years constantly buzzed. I probably was a high functioning alcoholic already 10 years ago.\n\nAnyway, as many with a bit more sober time under their belts probably have experienced, not drinking is/can be a very solitary road, especially if one doesn't attend AA meetings or SMART recovery stuff. And if you're in your mid-thirties, as I am.  AA isn't for me and there is no SMART recovery program in my country. Most of my friends, the real ones, have families and/or relationships and while meeting new people is relatively easy for me due to the social skills I've developed from my work, getting to know them and staying in contact seems like hard work. Often quite one-sided, too, as people tend to have their networks \"full\", in a sense.\n\nAand then there's the dating aspect. I've had a couple experiences, both nice as they were and unrelated to any bar activities etc. But I don't really know if I should pursue that either as I am kind of figuring out who I actually am at the moment (going to therapy, dealing with anxiety/depression &amp; past traumas) and I kind of feel that any emotional blows might be a risk to my sobriety. But I really crave for connection at the same time. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to ask is whether anyone has had similar experiences and how did you (or did you) solve this dilemma? Did you set a \"sober time frame\" for dating? ",

   "selftext": "A quick backstory here, I won't bore you all with the extreme details. \n\nI began drinking when I was 14. All throughout high school and indeed the first two years of college, I regularly indulged, but overall I didn't do it to excess but maybe 4-6 times a year. Teenagers do that. Before 18 I was maybe blacked-out twice. It is important to add that during this time I was very socially aware. Anxiety? That's what **other people** get. I had no difficulties in social situations, with friends, with girls. Then in my sophomore year of college, it changed. I wanted to kill that bar, or my friend's alcohol supply. Instead of a reset button that it was for so many years, alcohol became a challenge. Give me a beer, I'll drink eleven of them just out of spite. \n\nThis continued throughout college, and slowly and surely I realized that my ability to socialize without alcohol was changing.... but that was okay, as long as I could socialize during drinking.... right? No. While I was never a chronic drinker, I took my sparse, sporadic drinking to more extremes. I killed relationships, friendships. I've probably been absolutely blacked-out, beyond all recognition (problem was, I never passed out) 40+ times. \n\nTwo years ago I ended another very close relationship with my binge drinking. I got black-out drunk. I remember nothing of it. I quit, relapsed, and quit again seven months ago.\n\nAll has been good. I can go to the bars with my wife and friends and live vicariously through them. I truly enjoy watching them have fun while I sip Red Bulls and drive them around town as a cheuffeur. I enjoy spending time with family while they drink because of the stories that come from it. I enjoy going to restaurants while my friends/wife are drinking and have crazy conversations. \n\nI thought my sobriety was going well, until I realized that my social anxiety outside of this small group of friends and my wife and a very few select members of my family had completely collapsed. I've never felt this kind of anxiety before. It's completely crippling, and as of the last two months, it's infected my friends group as well. I can't read people as well as I used to, I take offense to small slights, and I worry constantly about what I'm going to say. \n\nTonight, for example, some friends and I went to the bar to celebrate a big event in our lives (I graduated with my second degree). We went to one bar, it was fine, and then at the second bar everyone started mingling with other groups.... and I fucking fell apart. Not being able to drink made it so that I could not replace the false social awareness I once had with ones that were natural. I could not mingle with classmates, yet again, I could not mingle with their friends, I could not mingle with my own friends, I even wanted to be away from my wife. \n\nAnd it didn't just happen tonight. Two weeks ago it happened at a dinner function with classmates and professionals. And it's happened periodically over the last couple months in classes, at family functions, with my own brothers and sisters. No matter where I am, surrounded by alcohol or not surrounded by alcohol, I find myself having such difficulty with social interactions now. I get angry over things, I overreact to things, I find myself questioning my own personality. \n\nThing is, years ago I was at a point where I was able to mingle and complete these interactions without alcohol. Now, I cannot reclaim that. Does this happen to people after getting sober? Is it odd that it's happening to someone who was a binge alcoholic vs. a chronic alcoholic? How can I begin moving forward to reclaim who I once was? \n\nSeven months, but these last two months have been torture. Not that I want to return to drinking, necessarily, it very nearly ruined my life....  but that I can't figure out how to create feelings of happiness and regain my composure because so many of my recent years I **replaced** these skills with alcohol.... how do I become the Hydrobear I once was without alcohol? What are others' experiences in this realm?  \n\n(I will generally disregard any posts stating to avoid bars. That's not what I'm trying to figure out. The fact that these things happen in both non-drinking and drinking settings frightens me. That example was just the most recent of my failure to thrive socially with my sobriety, and what drove me to write this tonight. The dinner (with no alcohol, as it was a professional dinner), was also similar--something set off my anxiety and I wasn't able to climb back during it). ",

I had been a bit of a loner and had trouble connecting to my peers, but when I drank I felt that all fade away. I\u2019ve always had a very \u201cgo hard or go home mentality\u201d ESPECIALLY when it came to my partying. I found myself always being the one to drink the most, stay out the latest, and do the wildest things. That reputation stopped being alluring and much more shameful over time, as I spent so many long days miserably hungover, obsessing over all of the cringeworthy things I had done and said the night before. \n\nI eventually felt bored with just being drunk, and the social effects diminished- I started craving that fearless, excited feeling I got from drinking. I found myself doing everything I could to get my hands on drugs while out- coke, MDMA, acid, you name it. The euphoria would last an hour or two and id spend the next day hating myself for my lack of control and promising it was the last time, yet the second I had a beer or went out socially at all, I felt that itch to binge it all once again.  I hesitated to address that my partying was hindering my life severely, because  words like \u201calcoholic\u201d or drug addict just seemed overboard; I only partied around once a week, but when I did, it was always a train wreck where I pushed myself to the absolute limit.\n\nI just want to know who I am without needing a substance to express myself or feel validated. I\u2019m so sick of having something in my life that makes me so weak-I want to say it\u2019s done this time and follow through. I guess this post is just a way to get off my chest and admit that I have a problem. My binging has made me scared to lose my boyfriend who is the most loving, responsible person- but I know he can\u2019t keep putting up with all of this much longer. I don\u2019t want any more sleepless nights after making a fool of myself, vomiting, blowing money and just losing all my control. \n\nSo yeah, I guess if there\u2019s any support or suggestions anyone has for my day 1 of a new life, please let me know.

I didn't drink a full bottle last night so..I deserve to have another 350ml bottle.. next night..ive had such a shit day and I'm so tired and just want to relax. It's ok if I get another 350ml bottle of Jack..im also really depressed and want to feel nothing. There is alot of inbetween the lines here to this story. Alot of personal family pressures that I don't have the energy to go into.  I have my vehicle for sale and a guy very interested in it. Plan was we agreed on a price and agreed time 8.30am for him to see it. He asked me to have road worthy and papers ready for him to just be able to take it. Only thing was night before I decide another 350ml bottle won't hurt as I'm stressed getting the road worthy blah blah and I've committed to leave asap same morning to see my grandson 6 hour drive away which I don't drive but my learner driver daughter is doing as she needs that experience. So at 11.45pm that night I fully get up this guy if he's not serious not to piss me around..yes I used those words as I've got a lot on personally and to please not talk me down on price..and Ive got shit to do so dont want to be stuffed around...more I wrote but am too tired now to  too get into it. After that message I fall into bed..grab my phone and set my alarm for 6am so I have time to pack and deal with this guy coming to buy my Ute. It tells me I get 6 hours sleep. I just want to keep drinking but know I have to sleep. I will myself to sleep that night. Next morning alarm goes off..im like FUCK! OK I gotta get up..and I do. Go to the toilet grab my phone completely forgetting my text to my prospective buyer..see his reply and it all comes back..he texts me..at 5.45am I won't be coming to see you. I don't appreciate getting a text at 11.45pm at night and being dictated too. Hope you find another buyer for you Ute..im up at 6am so I reply well that's ok. I asked you not to piss me around and not talk me down in price so I appreciate that. He texts back I intended to be there at agreed time and agreed price but was turned off by u drinking and texting me.. hmm of course I've made all excuses in my favour for that reply. So I'm really gutted by that and struggle with it. I say to myself..u weren't dictating..u didn't want to be stuffed around..so has being a dickhead!\nAnyway so I do the 7 hour drive that day. I'm tired..but I'm focused for my daughter.\nWe get to our destination..pick up my grandson. All is well. We had a unit close to the hotel. Walking distance. I think..ive had a big day..and order and had 4 double Jack's with soda water. During dinner with my daughter and grandson. I'm good thruout. My daughter takes my grandson back to the apartments we booked for the night. As I've got to have alone time and stay and have more Jack's . I have another double Jack..then just want to be with my daughter and grandson. So I think..fk this..ill just stop by at the bottelo and grab one bottle of wine and be with the kids and go to bed early..while I'm at the bottlo I think..mayne I grab 2 bottles..for safe measure. I drink one bottle of wine and tip the other down the sink. I had a 7 hour trip back next day. Also photos my daughter took of me and my grandson..i look like a bloated bullfrog once again. Point of this story..i get On an alcoholic big time. I admit it finally. Not sure how I'm going to do this but..its gotta stop. I'm tired of fighting.

   "selftext": "Good morning, my favorite group of people. \nMy alcoholism started when I started graduate school. I had to fly 2x a month to school (several states away) for my program... the rest was online. I was terrified of flying, so I started getting drunk on the planes. Like, really drunk. It eventually turned into me getting drunk before doing homework, me getting drunk after class, and then me getting drunk all of the time- funny how that happens, eh?\nAt the last semester (last August) I decided to begin my sobriety journey. I opened up to some close class mates about needing support. One of them replied, \"I don't understand why they say that relapse is a part of recovery... doesn't that encourage relapse?\". I thought about this for a while. I eventually replied with something along the lines of that fact that I believe that so long as we learn from our mistakes and reflect on our relapses, it makes us stronger and more in communication with our sober self. I tried explaining the disease, the change in dopamine, the neuropathways, etc... and she replied, \"OH! It's kind of like my food addiction!\". She actually started reading This Naked Mind with me, and worked on her food addiction. She then understood the \"relapse\" and how it can be a tool in recovery, as long as she was learning from it.\n\nI've read This Naked Mind twice. I check in here 4-5x/week. I've been to a few AA meetings. I've opened up to my family. And I still relapse. I used to become extremely discouraged about my relapses. But, it has taught me to learn more. Study more. Reflect more. Teach others about this nasty, shitty disease to reduce the stigma. Just like school- if I had a bad grade on a paper, I needed to study more. Focus more. Take it more seriously. Just like sobriety. \n\nAnd just like I don't expect to become the perfect professional once I graduate (in JULY!!), I don't expect to be perfect about my drinking. I need to be agile, learn from my mistakes, be open to further tools and education, and set the bar high for myself. Life-long learning has become my goal, and I hope someday I can pay it forward and teach all that I have gained from my degree in sobriety. \n\nIWNDWYT!",

This post might be a little long, but I need to vent because I haven't been able to confide in anyone about this.\n\nI just turned 28 and I've been a binge drinker since 21. On a quick side note, it's very interesting to note the different types of drinkers on here. Some people struggle to make it a few days, but don't take it to the extreme when they drink. As for me, I have no problem going a week, even two, but once I decide to drink, it becomes an all day/night affair, and my body is becoming less and less able to handle it. \n\nUp until a few years ago, I could put myself through the ringer for an entire day and crush 15+ beers and only need the day after to recover. My body turned a corner about three years ago, though. I had just returned from living in Prague for a couple years, which is where I think I officially became a full-fledged alcoholic. This was only exacerbated when I returned to the States and got a job that involved being around the local Russian community. At least once a week I'd meet up with some of them and just polish off bottles of vodka like it was nothing. A lot of stupid shit happened during this time, and I even hurt myself a couple times. I think this stage of my life caused irreversible damage to the mechanisms that filter out alcohol in my body.\n\nI made the choice to cut back last weekend, but before that I was still getting fucked up about once a week. I noticed that it takes me a full seven days to get back to normal. It affects my sleeping patterns the most. I'll have strange and sometimes terrifying dreams for the first five days, tossing and turning and waking up scared. After the seventh day, I'll finally feel normal and my body tells me, \"Let's get back at it again!\" In other words, I am almost NEVER 100%\n\nI managed to resist the urge last night and I'm sitting here feeling great, but I have another challenge on deck for tonight. Got invited out to a BYOB Chinese restaurant, and I have a feeling the lady who invited me is gonna buy beer for me, because she knows I love it. This might sound like a cop out to some of you, but if she does, I'm not going to decline. It'll be perceived as rude if I do, because no one else is gonna drink it. The challenge will be to limit myself to three beers max. She might not bring any, though, so we'll see. Regardless of what happens tonight, I'm committing to remaining sober for the rest of the month. \n\nSorry for the long and kinda unorganized post. I've been meaning to let this all out for a while. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. \n",

I rewarded myself for cleaning and working out by getting a burrito for dinner which was always my plan, but I was surprised by my desire to order a beer at the taqueria \\- I think it was my lizard brain associating margaritas and beers with burritos on a beautiful day. I got a Fanta instead and hoovered my burrito and the feeling passed but it took me off guard. Today I'm going to finish cleaning my place, go to yoga, go to a meeting, then wrap mother's day gifts and go to dinner with my family. I'll probably miss drinking with dinner because the restaurant is nice and has a good cocktail menu, but I am lucky because my dad doesn't drink \\(recovering alcoholic who has been sober for about two decades now\\) and I'll just follow his lead. My family knows I quit drinking so I'm fortunate that that they are supportive and won't pressure me to drink. \n\nLooking forward to making it to two weeks, so IWNDWYT!",

   "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI've been gradually tapering up to 50mg naltrexone daily.\n\nMy alcohol consumption has definitely decreased, but I am SOOOO bored in my downtime. I think this is why I started drinking in the first place... I don't really have any friends and only occasionally see my family.\n\nI'm guessing this means I need to find some kind of hobby?\n\nAnyone have any experience to share? I'm slowly realizing that drinking is more and more pointless and doesn't actually make me feel good. Just need to find something to do in place of drinking... The problem is I don't really have money to do anything else. :/\n\nI have tried playing free video games but they get pretty boring after awhile too... I usually watch Netflix all day but that on its own isn't enough to keep me occupied. I've gained so much weight from drinking \\(and spent so much money\\) that is why I am trying to quit now. It all started off as helping me fall asleep and then I fell into a habit of drinking 24 beers in a night or 750 ml of vodka in a night. If I am off work for the day I start drinking as soon as I wake up ... if I am driving 2 hours to see my family I get cinnamon whiskey and take a couple pulls during my drive ... nobody has said anything about noticing alcohol on my breath. But I know it's a problem and I am committed to quitting. It's just so hard. That's why I asked my doctor for naltrexone \\(which was pretty high copay but I figure cheaper than drinking long\\-term\\). ",

   "selftext": "I am 2 weeks sober today. I have been using cycling as a way to distract me. As a young man I was a competitive cyclist despite being alcoholic. My performance deteriorated over the years due to the aging process, alcohol addiction, and multiple injuries (fractured collarbones, wrist, vertebrae, ribs etc). Crashing in bicycle racing is commonplace. Being hung over does not really improve your reflexes. By the time I entered my 50s, I had essentially given up.\nAfter quitting alcohol 2 weeks ago, I have been riding again daily. I ride in my garage on rollers. My bike is ancient, but equipped with a modern power meter that I installed. I started with 30 min daily, now I am spinning for about 2 hours without problems. I ride with this cycling virtual reality computer game called Zwift. Today I rode up the Alpe de Zwift climb at full gas. I did it in less than an hour, averaging &gt;300 watts. I was pouring sweat and almost puked in the last mile. I was flying by other riders the whole way. I could not believe how good I felt. I could never have done that a month ago. Though still puffy from alcohol, I can feel my body changing slowly. I'm inspired. \nI wondered if there are any others out there using their sporting talents to assist their recovery? I would like to hear their stories. ",

   "selftext": "Hi r/stopdrinking\n\nToday is my first day of no boozing (ignore my current badge lol). Had a rough night last night and realized that booze and I just dont get along. I've taken breaks from drinking while dieting to lose weight/save money and try to be healthier but last night was the final straw.\n\nMy girl and I got in a heated arguement and we ended up screaming at each other over some dumb silly drama and I went overboard and said some extremely hurtful things to her. She ended up driving home to her parents house up the road to spend the night and I didnt sleep a wink last night thinking my relationship was going to be over and worrying that her parents think I'm a piece of shit.\n\nI've had a checkered past with alcohol. My father is a recovering sober alcoholic so it runs in my family and although I haven't been a daily drinker, when I do drink I act like an idiot and say some mean things I dont mean. I also had gotten a DUI a few years back coming home from a concert, a few months ago I punched a hole in the wall out of anger while being drunk and last night seeing my girl crying and wondering if we were going to break up is just too much to handle. I literally cant have booze again. I've told myself I could cut back in the past but it eventually leads up to me getting hammered at some point and I say or do something I regret tremendously. Every thing I've done that I regret is directly related to booze so booze has to go. I look forward to my sobriety, having a clear head and not feeling guilty or depressed anymore about my actions or words. I'm sure I'll feel better emotionally, physically, save some money and most importantly my relationship. I never want to feel this shame again in my life. I look forward to talking to you all on this sub. Not even sure I had a point I had to make but i just wanted to thank you all for being there and supporting one another. \n\nPeace",

   "selftext": "So this has been the longest I've gone without Alcohol in about a year. \n\nWhile I don't think I would call myself an alcoholic, I spent 100% of last year drinking. It pretty much became a nightly thing for me. It reflected in my mood, my body just felt terrible all the time, I slept horribly and just became a generally shitty person. \n\nThis January however, a few job opportunities came up and I knew that I needed to change myself for the better. It's 91 days now and... wow. \n\nI don't think I've been this happy in a long time. I've grown socially, emotionally and mentally. I lost (and this is a real number) 18 pounds from just cutting out the alcohol alone. I've impressed tremendously at work- so much that my salary was raised to a number that makes me extremely comfortable. \n\nLike I said, I don't consider myself an alcoholic. When I decided to quit, it was a simple and easy choice. I never felt any physical temptation to go back to alcohol and I find myself pretty lucky for that. \n\nBut I think that this would be valuable for those like me. Those who lurked around here for months but never actually stepped to the challenge. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that it doesn't matter if you're an alcoholic or not. If you're a nightly drinker, there **will** be positive effects from quitting. Even if you don't think you need to stop drinking, test yourself. Try it out. 90 days of sobriety can reveal some surprising things about yourself. \n\nLastly, I do want to thank this community for being what it is. I don't think words can express the kind of love and support I've seen from people here. It's genuine, empathetic and uplifting every time I look at this subreddit. \n\nThank you all for that. I will not drink with you today.\n\n",

   "selftext": "The first thought that came to my mind when I woke up this morning was \"I can't be an alcoholic.\"\n\nI gave it some thought and it made me feel good for a moment, but then I ran through the list of things in my life that I've destroyed when I drank and decided that at least for today, I'll be an alcoholic. \n\nI read The Silver Linings playbook last night and today. It struck a cord with me because the main character and I share the same name and the same feeling of loss. The one thing that he had that I didn't was a sense of hope. Although, towards the end that sense of hope became something else, a sense of contentment. He had lost everything because of things he had done, but he had hope he could change. And he did.\n\nIt's quiet now and I'm trying to read another book, but I can't help but think about myself. How my life has gone and if I can ever truly become a better person. It's terrifying being left alone with myself.\n\nI am my own company and I can't say I necessarily like the company. My thoughts immediately jump towards getting a drink, getting away from myself. I don't want to admit the things that I've done and the people I've hurt and everything that I've ever lost. At least when I'm drunk I can find interest in somthing. \n\nEverything boils down to a hatred of myself. I feel like I could forgive everyone else in the world for the horrible things that they do except for myself. I don't know how to talk to myself, to tell myself that things are going to be ok. Worst of all I don't know how to admit to myself that I'm an alcoholic without feeling profundly weak or pathetic. \n\nI feel like I'm cutting out a major part of life that everyone else can participate in and have fun with and here I am, eternally the outcast, the loser who can't even take a sip of alcohol without turning into Mr. Hyde. The loser who's going to AA meetings, who can't even speak up in front of others without having all the thoughts knocked out of my head.\n\nLast night after leaving AA all I wanted to do was have a shot of whiskey and just feel normal again. I've been drunk for so long I don't even know what it means to be myself anymore. I don't even know who this person is. It's like I'm with a stranger and it's terrifying.\n\nBut, for now I will not drink. I will work my way through this day. Maybe, who I am isn't so bad. Maybe this person can be of some value to the world. Maybe tomorrow things will be just a little bit better.",

Listened when nobody else would. I am thirty seven now and I just do not know what to do to help him, I have recently, a year ago I guess, moved back to the old hometown after a fourteen year absence. He is getting quite bad.

   "selftext": "Hi folks,\n\nA quick synopsis: One month ago, I got the call that my brother who lived in Colorado (I live in Maine) had died suddenly and unexpectedly of a heart attack after riding his dirt bike. He was 49 years old. \n\n\nThe autopsy report showed extremely hardened arteries and a heart double its normal size. He had untreated RA, but he also smoked a pack a day for 30 years, didn't eat the healthiest diet and liked his whiskey. I wouldn't say he was an alcoholic, but he enjoyed getting a bit too drunk with his friends, which may have contributed to what I believe was largely a lifestyle-related death. \n\n\nIt has been the worst and hardest month of my life. We were very close, and I was fortunate to visit him just two months before he died, which makes this all the more haunting. I also lost my dad to a long, drawn-out serious of heart attacks when I was 16 (he was 72), but I'm 32 now and this seems different/way more in my face. \n\n\nA bit about me\u2014I have struggled with alcohol dependence since my early twenties. Yes, I like to overdo it a bit when we're all having fun, but for me, alcohol is what I've used to treat my underlying anxiety disorder for the better part of my life. Not the kind of thing where I'm waking up to a bottle, but more once I start drinking, it makes me feel \"normal\" and I have an incredibly hard time stopping. It can sometimes turn into 10 drinks throughout a given 24 hour period, though usually more like 3-5. \n\n\nNeedless to say, I have had a few near blackout nights since my brother's death and have been using alcohol as my primary coping mechanism. It got to the point where when I met my fiance after work last night (she works until 10pm), I could barely speak without slurring. She is not impressed and will no longer put up with this\u2014I don't blame her. \n\n\nI'm ready to make major changes in my life. I don't know if a life completely without alcohol is in my future\u2014it may be, though I would prefer a drastically altered relationship with alcohol as an alternative\u2014but I know right now, that's likely what has to happen. AA is something that I would prefer to avoid (please do not judge me for this), though I'm willing to potentially give it a shot. I'm also not looking for drugs as replacements; marijuana, for example, is something that I enjoy a lot but does not scratch the itch of alcohol, and as far as benzos/antidepressants go, been there, done that, not good for me.\n\n\nI guess I'm just looking for any/all thoughts as to how I can take this immense tragedy in my life and reap at least a small form of silver lining from it. I know that I need to be there for my mom who is 76 and lost her son, and I know I need to be there for my fiance who wants to start a family with me and move forward in the wake of this awful experience. \n\n\nThank you all in advance.

   "selftext": "Hello. i am a thirty seven year old sexual/physical, etc. abuse survivor that is ten months into recovery after jumping from a bridge a year ago. I am on here looking for advice, because I do not now what to do anymore. I have an uncle. He has some sort of Psychotic disorder, not quite schizophrenia because there are no voices, just delusions. It appears to be drug induced according to the doctors, he was heavily involved with acid as a kid and young man from thirteen or so. He is fifty nine now, and he was very good to me as a teenager. Listened when nobody else would. I am thirty seven now and I just do not know what to do to help him, I have recently, a year ago I guess, moved back to the old hometown after a fourteen year absence. He is getting quite bad. He still smokes meth, I thought the fact he had self control and was keeping it to maintenance was good, because he will not consider stopping.\n\nHe is involved with no psychologists or psychiatrists or therapists. He has never taken Psychiatric medication. If it were not for the need for housing, he would not deal with the social workers, and they do not seem to feel differently, he or the worker fire each other very few months, they only meet him every two weeks. But I am in recovery, actually trying to make changes in my own autism, PTSD, depression and alcoholism. I am actively working with the workers, making changes, doing therapy. And this is just getting to be too much. He was here last week.\n\nHe thinks there are people in cars outside his house watching, that the government is bugging his house, that maybe he is dead and this is hell, that God is going to kill our entire family and have us crucified on the steps of our town's city hall, and that his friend has a parasite in his brain that is allowing him to read his thoughts. He has been getting weepy at the terrible things he did in the past, because he is an ex con who has done seven of nine years in total in jail and prison. So I hold him, because he is distraught, and try to be there for him as he was me. I was seeing him several times a week, though it is more like one now. But he gets in these rages, phoning and ranting at some perceived slight. He feels the family has abandoned him, which is pretty true, and takes it out on me, as there are few others.\n\nNow he is enraged because I said months ago that maybe internet access was not a bad idea, that there was some stuff there that may connect him more to others.

   "selftext": "Feeling terrible today after drinking too much yesterday and making a fool of myself \\(I think, can't really remember that well\\).\n\nI've been drinking way too much for 10 years now. Parents and college normalized nightly drinks for me so, from about 20 to 26 years old, I never even thought of how detrimental is was for me. I honestly didn't even realize I was drinking more than everyone else around me most of the time. I was so brainwashed that I just got drunk and figured everyone was keeping up. \n\nAt 26, I started to realize what was going on around me and just how serious my drinking had become. I lived in Colorado for a couple of years and when my wife went to work I\u2019d just grab a 6 pack of the strongest IPA I could find and drink them while watching movies on my laptop. I was doing this while all of my friends were out enjoying the incredible sun and parks of Colorado. Of course, all of this also led to me hating when my lovely wife came back from work just because she was interrupting my drinking \\(and dipping, I shudder when I think about how many years I\u2019ve taken off my life and teeth\\). \n\nAnyways, I became hyper aware of how crazy I actually acted when I had too many. There are some specific nights that make me want to melt into the ground when I think about how I acted. Loud, stumbling, spilling drinks, and talking about myself way too much. Add in some nights where I passed out on a bench downtown, ordered 3 hotels in one night for a total of $800 and woke up to my wife and the police looking for me, and yesterday, when I was a blabbering idiot in front of a potential business partner.\n\nThe problem has always been that I\u2019m an extremely high functioning alcoholic. Over the last 4 years I\u2019ve spent a lot of time trying to quit drinking in spurts. Tried all sorts of rules like \u201cno drinking until 5\u201d or \u201conly as many beers as miles I run in a day\u201d. I talked to others about what I was trying to do in attempt to mend fences. All that has created is this odd thing where I don\u2019t really want people to know I\u2019m drinking so I feel more comfortable having a beer when I\u2019m cooking dinner or being useful in other ways.\n\nI have a daughter now with that same, supremely understanding, wife from Colorado, with another on the way. The longest stint of not drinking I\u2019ve had was when my first daughter was born and it was the best, most successful time in my life. I literally doubled my salary and bought a house in 4 months. Almost like I put in cheat codes for life.\n\nI understand this is a long rambling post. For those who read it, I thank you. For those who didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t blame you. I had to get some of this off my chest. I just poured a nice big pint of Kombucha \\(alcohol free kind\\) and I won\u2019t be drinking tonight. My hope is that I don\u2019t drink for the rest of my life, though if I\u2019m honest, I\u2019ve gone through this cycle so many times that I\u2019m having a hard time believing I will do that.",

My dad and sister just left for my sisters final senior prom pictures. I'm supposed to be sober while in this program and I'm trying really hard to be successful this weekend because I wasn't the last two. I asked my dad earlier about non alcoholic beer (he's a recovered alcoholic) because my friend's are home tonight for the first time since school ended and I want to hang out with them but can't drink. He got annoyed with me, rose his voice, and said there's no point to non alcoholic beer and that I should just not drink. I told him I wouldn't have asked if I knew he would get mad about it and quickly ended the conversation. I helped my sister for the last few hours by doing her hair and makeup for her prom. Within 20 minutes from when we were supposed to leave she asked me to go the liquor store to get some vodka for her tonight. I told her no cause I'm having bad cramps and was feeling shaky, plus I'm trying to avoid any triggers that may cause relapse. She got extremely mad, slammed her door shut and didn't say bye or thanks to me before she left. Im feeling horrible about not being at her last prom pictures right now. I'm just confused and feeling alone and hurt right now. Please help me stay strong. I don't know if I should hang out with my friends tonight cause I'm currently having a full blown anxiety attack. I want to see them cause I haven't for about a month. Any words of reassurance would help. Thank you in advance. ",

That's what people have said to me for a few years now, well when I'm honest more than a few years, more like 10 years, so fuck 'em why not prove them right, that'll teach them!  A year or so ago my wife was crying in bed saying she married a drunk after she got home around 7ish and I was drunk juggling knives and cooking a five course meal making a mess out of the kitchen she had just cleaned.  After that night I quit drinking for 23 days until we were having sushi and I kept saying how I wanted a beer but thought I could moderate, even though secretly I knew it would lead back to me sneaking shots when the wife went to the bathroom or hiding beer cans before she got home and brushing my teeth.  I could feel my liver the next day hurting from the amount I was drinking consistently.  My grandfather on my mother's side was a drinker, same with my dad though in much more moderation around the kids, we never saw him drunk though, my brother and his wife had been clean for 5 years or so now.  Alcoholism is in my blood, I accept this.  However, I accept that it's in my control whether or not to drink.  I know I want to not die from liver poising before my baby daughter graduates from college.  I told my wife today when I got home I'm done, permanently, forever.  I know my life will be better without alcohol.\n\nIWNDWYT",

Anyone with expertise or or experience would be greatly appreciated. I live in the United States and have Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance, if that helps.   ",

   "selftext": "Hello everyone, usually I just lurk on this sub reddit but at this point I have no where else to talk about my drug issues so I figured here would be a good place to start. I\u2019m sorry that this is going to be long story but I appreciate any advice anyone could provide. I\u2019m also sorry for sharing my story I just want to tell someone. \n\nI\u2019m currently 17 and about to graduate from high school. Freshman year I started smoking weed and it was the greatest thing in the world. I felt like I was cool and people would like me due to using. My whole life I\u2019ve had an issue with doing things in order to be \u201ccool\u201d in front of my peers. During my freshman year, I thought I finally had friends who I felt liked me for me (however they only liked me because I was buying the weed lol). Sophomore year I transferred schools to a new school and my world was turned upside down.  I played sports still at this point so I had a few friends through sports but other then that I felt I was completely isolated from everyone. I had trouble finding friends and I was very lonely. Due to this feeling of isolation I began to smoke and drink a lot to escape reality. \n\nOne Friday night, I decided to go to a football game since my old friends were coming and they had some xans/weed. While I was at this football game I met my now girlfriend Who I will call E and we became best friends. E didn\u2019t smoke or really do any type of drugs but she hung out with my old group of friends from my previous school. That night we met was amazing I never felt so close to someone before. She felt the same way hence why we became best friends. \n\nOnce we met, we became inseparable. We would hang out every day after school, and then again after she got home from work. Eventually, E became interested in smoking as well so she begun to smoke with me. This in turn caused me to smoke even more (between me and her we were blowing through around a half ounce a week) \n\nA few months into us hanging out (towards the end of sophomore year) we started to date and we began to hang out even more then we already did. Since we spent so much time together I decided to quit sports so I could still hang out with her all the time but at the same time get fucked up all the time. I felt that in order to impress her and keep her loving me I had to be this crazy motherfucker that is constantly getting fucked up since that\u2019s who I was when we met. This mentality caused me to smoke and drink even more. \n\nThe summer going into junior year things took a turn for the worst. Since I was no longer participating in sports I was able to smoke practically 24/7. To support my habit of smoking I began to sell weed and bottles I stole from convenience stores (during this time in my life I was a huge shoplifter I would steal as an activity) \n\nJunior year I was on a cocktail of drugs all the time. If I wasn\u2019t ditching school to go smoke, I was drinking in school or popping pills. Junior year my girlfriend and I were smoking an ounce a week. E never did any other drugs but she would smoke because I was smoking a shit ton. At the end of junior year, the worst accident of my life happened. I slept over at Es house the night before and I woke up to her screaming in pain because she stunned her toe or something literally fucking stupid to get mad over. The previous night I had gotten shitfaced  around so when she woke me up screaming in pain at 6 am I was still messed up. I woke up and I remember freaking out on her then leaving to go smoke. As I was driving I decided to go get a soda so I wouldn\u2019t cough up a lung. As I was waiting to turn into circle K there was a line of cars waiting at a red light. (They we\u2019re blocking the turn in for circle K it\u2019s hard to explain without pictures) one car decided to let me go through so I begun to pull through but then realized I couldn\u2019t see if anyone was coming from the second lane. While I was trying to figure out what to do a benz pulled up behind me and payed on his horn to make me go. I looked at the driver who let me go through and He looked behind him and waved me through so I assumed that I was good. The moment I pulled through I saw a Ford Explorer going around 40-45 mph coming straight at me. The next thing I remember is waking up hanging out of my window. I was covered in blood and my head was swelling from debris hitting me on the head. Both cars were totaled and my car personally was the most fucked up. (Thank god I was also the only one to get injured) My passenger side door was inside of my car, my front passenger seat was in the back of my car, and the roof had caved in on the side of impact. Literally the only part of my car that wasn\u2019t fucked up was the drivers seat.  Most normal people\u2019s first thought would be to ensure everyone was okay but no not this fuck up. The first thing I did was called my girlfriend to come grab the weed so I wouldn\u2019t get a ticket. \n\nWhen I came somewhat to my senses hours later I realized that I had an issue but wasn\u2019t ready to address it. I thought the way to move past this accident was to get even more fucked up. \n\nTo summarize from this point on to avoid things getting to long my substance abuse issues only became worse. I started using either hydros (4 day or so but I was taking up to 8 a day) or xans (2-3 bars a day) (I would use whatever I could get)  along with weed.  The beginning of 2018, I decided fuck pills and have been using weed to get past that addiction. I thought by quitting the joy of doing things would come back but I still can not feel happy from doing normal people things. The only thing that sounds fun to me is getting fucked up. How do I change this mentality? All my friends smoke or drink for fun and I genuinely do not know how to have fun without being fucked up anymore. I can\u2019t even do normal things like go to work or school without being high in some way. What did you do to move past this mentality and begin enjoying normal activities again? Also my girlfriend, although she uses weed she supports my decision and wants to help in any way possible. \n\nI appreciate any advice that can be offered and I\u2019m sorry for leaving my life story I just want to share it with someone who won\u2019t glorify drug use.

   "selftext": "Hi.\nI'm seriously worried about my brother. \nI'm worried that if I voice my concerns it will be like praying my fears into reality. \n\nHowever, if I don't get this out somewhere I don't know how I'm going to go to sleep tonight. \n\nBackground: My brother is living with my parents right now. I live in another state but am in town this week to celebrate my dad's retirement. I'm 26. He's 24. \n\nRight now I'm so full of white hot fear I don't even know where to start. \n\nI've known my brother liked drugs and alcohol for a long time. I know his relationship with self hatred backed by a seemingly bottomless thirst for booze/weed wrecked his college career. He's always been bright, athletic, and even has natural charisma (when he's sober/happy). Still, he scraped the lowest possible GPA to graduate and it was honestly a miracle. \n\nAfter graduating he lived in a shit-hole with a literal hole in the kitchen floor in a rural town that died with the mining industry. I might not have the story right but from what he described, his life revolved around waking up to smoke moles (weed and tobacco from a bong) with his roommate, *maybe* making it to his job where he and a buddy would smoke more moles, then wandering home where he'd drink and fight with his roommates, pass out in the living room, and repeat. He lost a lot of weight and his eyes seemed to sink into his beautiful face. He told me later he'd started avoiding spending money on food so he could have more money for weed. \n\nMy entire family was worried. After he was let go from his job, my mom convinced him to move home. I was relieved. My parents are both sober (my maternal grandfather was an abusive alcoholic &amp; my parents rarely have alcohol in the house)- I thought he'd have to sober up. It seemed like he did for a while. \n\nHe's hard to reach on the phone and I haven't spoken with him much since Christmas. To be honest, I have my own demons to wrestle and we aren't as close as I'd like us to be. I'm working own recovery (I'm in DA) and have had numerous health problems this year. So I guess what I'm skirting around saying (and trying to eschew blame for) is I hadn't talked to my brother and I was surprised by his attitude when I flew in this week. \n\nHe seems like he's hiding something. He doesn't sleep much. He's been confrontational, sensitive, avoidant, impossible. He waits for all of us to go to bed so he can drink whiskey. Comments from my parents are making me wonder if he only makes it to work on time because they wake him up. \n\n...then there's the behavior that unfolded within the last 48 hours. \n\nHe evidently forgot I was flying in on Wednesday despite a long phone call I had with him and the fact that my dad's retirement party was on Thursday. My brother claims he thought I was coming to town today (Saturday). Therefore, he decided to go to an acquaintance's brother's graduation party in another town (30m away) on Friday night. And when he realized I was in town he found it impossible to get out of that very important celebration. \n\nFine, whatever. He's 24 and these are his priorities right now. \n\nOn Thursday, my parents and I decided we'd like to go on a hike today (Saturday) so I asked him if he'd like to join. He said he wasn't sure when he'd be back from the party and explained he had some errands to run. We brainstormed some ways he could get out of the errands.\n\nYesterday (Friday), it was established that he hadn't resolved his errands. I said I was disappointed he hadn't left his calendar open but, since I hadn't directly asked him about his plans ahead of time, that I understood. \n\nHe got upset and kept repeating that when he knew where and when we were going then he'd be able to figure out his errands.\n\nSo we figured it out as a group at dinner and told him we'd be leaving at 8:30am today (Saturday). As he stepped out the door to go drinking he said he'd see us at 8:30. My mom laughed, \"You won't be here at 8:30.\" He left angry. \n\nToday I texted him after our hike (around noon) to let him know we were getting lunch and when we would be back. We had talked about doing something as a group in the evening and I wanted to give him a heads up. No response to me but I guess he checked in with my mom around 1:00. \n\nWe get back and he doesn't show. Hours pass. His friend, \"Z\", shows up at around 8pm but my brother is nowhere and hasn't answered his phone for hours. \"Z\" and my brother were supposed to hang out and my brother had told \"Z\" he could stay the night. \n\nSuddenly, my brother calls \"Z\" and claims surprise when \"Z\" offers to put him on the phone with my dad. Evidently my brother \"didn't realize\" \"Z\" was at our house already. They make plans to get dinner when my brother gets back (from his supposed location 30m away). It's about 8:15 maybe 8:30 at this point. \n\nWhen he walked in the house at 10pm I was surprised he could make it through the living room without tripping over the tension. \n\nThere's a long, awkward silence. My mom asked, \"So, what happened to you?\"\n\nHe doesn't look at us and walks into the kitchen, \"I was waiting.\"\n\nI fall into a silent, uncomfortable laughter. It's a pathetic excuse. \n\nMy mom says, \"for Godot?\"\n\nHe misses the reference and shows her his iPhone which says \"no Sim card\" and claims he hasn't gotten any texts all day.\n\nI guess he forgot he was texting my mom at lunch.\n\nI finally get a glimpse at his face and he's absolutely stoned at the least. \n\nMy brain cuts to a conversation from Wednesday night where he was almost bragging about how many times he's driven drunk. \n\nWas he driving drunk tonight?\n\nWhat did he do last night?\n\nIf he was waiting that long, couldn't he have come up with a better excuse?\n\nDoes he think none of us know how easy it is to remove a SIM card from your own phone to claim it's broken?\n\nThe brother I grew up with would've apologized. \n\nBut the main thing rabbit-running through my head right now is that this might just be the beginning. That I don't know how to help him. That I honestly can't help him. That he will have to help himself.\n\nAnd I'm terrified.\n\nI'm scared this will continue to escalate. I'm scared of what this will do to his body, his life, my parents, me. \n\nI'm hoping I'm wrong. I'm praying I'm projecting. I'm seeing red flags. \n\n(Is he an addict? Is he an addict? Is he an addict? Please don't let him be an addict.)\n\nIf you got this far on my long story, thank you. \n\nIf you think I'm looney toons and should get a hobby instead of worrying I would be happy to hear it. \n\nIf you think I'm on to something - how do I help? Can I help? Is there anything I can do to avoid making it worse? ",

Nothing has came and interfered to convince me that, \"hey, maybe life is worth living after all\". It's been the complete opposite. Open the internet and read something that further depresses me, try to entertain myself with something mundane on YouTube, attempt to have a discussion despite my lack of social skills with my parents over some stupid subject - assuming it's a weekend, when I'm not crying like an idiot at school, thanks to my lack of being able to understand human interaction and the inability to comprehend even the most simplistic of questions.\n\nI'm tired.

   "selftext": "Hey I'm Becky, what I am going to post is my inner demons and my deepest feelings/thoughts.\n I am a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, I'm coming up 10 months clean. \nThis post is my journey over the last year and I'll go into a bit of back story before I jump this.\n\nFirstly I'll go back to how my addiction started. I was around five years old when I had my first taste of alcohol. \nI had no clue what it was and I was not stealing it, I was ordered to finish the bottle.\n\n The person that gave it to me was my dad's best friend, lets call him Phillip, he was pretty much considered to be my uncle.\n I spent every second weekend at his house, my dad had me then, but you see he was too busy with his own habits to spend time with me. \n\nI was sexually abused by this person for years, without any knowledge of my family.\n This went on til I was eleven.\n That's when I discovered \"the benefits\" of drinking, so it become an everyday thing. I would take a bottle of vodka to school with me daily. \n\nWhen I was thirteen I discovered cannabis and tramadol.\n I continued doing these habits right through high school and of course the more you do something the somewhat more immune you become to it. \nSo my tolerance went up.\n It took me more and more to get the same effects.\n\n Around eighteen I moved into my boyfriends place and that's when things started getting risky. \nMy appetite vanished and my self hatred grew. I started starving myself and using anything I could get me hands on. \nWhen I turned twenty my body was rejecting everything i would put into it. \nI dropped to thirtytwo kilos and was doing weekly trips in the ambulance.\n Then something shitty happened. \nI was sexually assaulted by one of my boyfriends uncle at his daughters leaving party. \n\nFlashbacks started to happen.\n I couldn't cope with all the years of abuse I had blocked out and attempted suicide. \nNext day I wake up with a failed attempt of an overdose and questioning eyes. \nMy boyfriend knew everything. \nHe told me he couldn't do another night like this and that I needed help.\n So scared of myself I agreed. \n\nI was taken to an impatient unit where I spent two months. \nOkay so now I've explained some of my back story.\nIn the next part I'll share my diary entry's from those two months in care. \nIt's about to get intense. \n\nHope you all enjoyed part one ",

   "selftext": "So I'm a (former) blackout drinker. As many on this sub I only drank to get drunk and I loved drinking alone since it would mean I don't have to carry on conversations. I would just watch YouTube and get wasted.\n\nI started drinking only when I went to study to a different country. I was so happy I escaped the control of my relatively strict parents, I just went wild for a while. Then my drinking got more casual (or so I thought). In reality I always went overboard at least once a month, cause I \"had to\" numb myself and forget about reality. Preferably without my best friend/roommate knowing about it since she hated seeing me drunk.\n\nThen fast forward a couple years I changed career and found a stable job along with a new group of heavy drinking friends who were a bit older than me. And I kinda looked up to them, I thought that they were cool adults and I really wanted to fit in. On the first night I met them, I drank a lot of shots with them and eventually threw up and fell asleep in the bathroom. They called me an uber, the driver had to stop multiple times for me to vomit on the road. I was super embarrassed the next day but they told me it happens, no big deal.\n\nEvery time after that when I was hanging out with them, I tried to control myself but I wasn't satisfied with just being tipsy. At some point I started buying booze on the way home and getting \"properly\" hammered on my own. Or just going to the office on the weekend and drinking beer all day long there (we don't have cameras or security).\n\nFast forward a couple months, we have a team building event at work at a pension out of town. Booze is free, so I drink everything I can get my hands on, then dance and blackout. In the morning I'm not hungover but can't step on the left foot. Turns out I fell while dancing and badly sprained my ankle, my colleagues had to carry me to the room. Super embarrassing. After that they drove me home and I stayed in bed for a week. Guess what, it's been 6 months and it still hurts and I still limp around. Injury #1.\n\nThen my heavy drinking friends invited me for an outdoor pagan holiday which basically means getting drunk all day guilty free. I was excited, bought some good vodka which we drank at like 11 am along with beer and mimosas. Then the whole day got blurry, at some point I was offered a sip of hard liquor and drank the whole bottle instead. At night we went to a restaurant where I blacked out and fell sleep on the table a few times but refused to stop drinking. After that my good friend didn't talk to me for a week and my roommate (same one) got really worried so I promised both of them that I won't drink hard stuff and never make fool of myself again. \n\nOf course I broke the promise that same month. But I was behaving well (meaning not causing any big trouble), so it was \"fine\". Also somewhere along the way I built my tolerance and stopped vomiting after shots.\n\nNow comes the last event. Two weeks ago we went to a one of my friends' country house to party hard. I drank a lot of vodka on the first day and on the second we only had beer so I was kinda bummed and went to bed early. Then comes the last night and I buy vodka as a gift for a friend at home but decide to share it with everyone. Then I'm offered acid and of course I take it. They buy more beer, I buy more vodka. We get to cottage, I start drinking and talking about linguistics and black out. \n\nI woke up without hangover and found a dirty bucket near my bed. I was wearing my friend's shirt. No one really filled me in, pretending nothing happened. We went back home and I felt pain near my heart, I couldn't take a deep breath or move without pain. I got scared and started google search on signs of alcoholism and found this sub. After a few days my friend told me, that I was having a bad trip that night and went to the woods on my own in the middle of the night. My friends found me and dragged me to the cottage and put me to bed. I started vomiting in my sleep, they had to sit near me whole night cause I couldn't stop vomiting. I have zero memory of it.\n\nMy chest still hurts and I have a big bruise on my back. That's injury #2. After that trip I decided to stop drinking. I have yet to tell those friends about it, but I'm determined to get sober.\n\nAlso last night I watched Eurovision with a different group of people, they had some wine and cocktails, I was drinking water with lime and mint. A girl was sitting next to me, she was already drunk but kept drinking, talking and saying sorry for everything she said. I recognized myself in that girl. I would get hammered last night if it wasn't for this sub. \n\nThank you everyone and I won't drink with you today.",

   "selftext": "A little about me: White male, 29, average build and height; nothing special. Just another Amerifag really, except minus the millennial selfie-cultured bullshit. Hell, at my new job, I have a doppelganger. Same mannerisms, build, haircut. Maybe that gives you a sense of how average I am. Anyway, I've battled severe depression most of my life. I've lost most my family, including the man I knew as my father at eight; waking up late to school to find him cold next to me (we shared the master bedroom). I continued living with my grandfather until the corrupt organization DCF whisked me away to the prison-like homes where I spent over three years abused by multiple families. Fast forward to high school. Poor living conditions, but I had friends, and excelled in army ROTC. So, I finished school early and enlisted. First large mistake of my life. I saw corruption there as I've never seen it before. Abuse of power, drill sergeants under the influence of alcohol, bringing civilian women into the barracks and forcing exercise on troops just to show off, openly admitted gang members, threats of friendly fire among the ranks.. The list can go on. Some things I expected of basic training, but what's wrong is wrong. Regardless, I wanted out. This was not the military I grew up respecting. So, I quit. I stopped doing anything in basic, and received a general discharge. I felt I was cheated. Maybe if I went in a few weeks earlier or later I would've been instructed by hardened individuals that gave a fuck about their country, and not just themselves. I was sullen, bitter. Shortly thereafter, lost and depressed. No longer did I have a life long career. I had no plans. And it wasn't long before my fiance was gone too. So, like the good little proud patriot, I pick up the pieces and continue chasing the American dream. Skip ahead a few years of struggling, poor relationships and employment, and I land a seasonal role at busch gardens howl-o-scream as a scareactor (best job ever, just saying). My first year went beautifully. I made friends, I was engaging in outings. Things were looking up, and financial troubles didn't bother me as much. I grew up poor, so having any money was great. A fellow actress and I hit it off, and started dating shortly after the season ended. Second biggest mistake, and I'm violently risen from that American dream. This bane of my poor existence carries the name erica. I refuse to hide her name or information. In my desperation for affection, I ignored every warning until it was too late. It started with her alcohol intake. I offered help, and every time I went to her apartment I found bottles of rum stashed away. Well, everyone has their vices right? Then came \"modeling\". Posing nude for cash. I'm open minded enough, no harm there. Right? Then came an ex. Sending threatening messages to both of us. Police handled it. Until he sent a photo of her naked, covered in ejaculate. Of course I investigated, and was explained away as an old photo, and he was trying to start shit. Alas, at least something came of my years reading Arthur Conan Doyle; a bruise present in the photo was fresh on her body. I willingly take that blow, and try to continue on. At last, I come over early from work to surprise her, and she seems agitated. In the room I notice a small handbag that's usually hung in the closet draped on a chair. Immediately I notice a fair amount of cash in it. Surprising, coming from a woman who was trying to make ends meet. So, I grab it, and proceed to lose my fucking mind. 50 one dollar bills, five condoms, miscellaneous makeup and perfume and an assortment of pills at the bottom. A fucking whore. Literally. I made my way out, wrecking a few things in the process. Thinking that was over was my third mistake. She was evicted from her apartment, and out of desperation shacked up with a fellow actor from the previous season. A few weeks later, she contacted me, and stupid me follows the wrong brain. Loneliness makes you do stupid shit I guess. So, I pick her up right down the road where she lives with this guy, and we fuck in the parking lot of a library. Believing all the protestations of not having any interest in this guy mind you (because he was a little slow and kinda gross). After that little sojourn, I was done completely. And what do you know, she marries the retard. Just for a place to stay I'm sure. So. Mind you, all our sexual encounters were with protection. A few months pass, and I get sick. Surprise. HSV-2. A week later, severe HPV begins to grow, taking over the vast majority of my junk. Which brings us ladies and gentlemen, to today. Three years after this treacherous whore prayed on me. I haven't been the same person since. I've broken contact with most people I knew. I've sabotaged any progress I've made over and over again, because I quit caring. It's too easy to say fuck it, and watch whatever I've worked for our towards crumble in front of me. I've sold most my possessions, and bought an rv because I wanted to travel. It has instead become my sarcophagus. It's not road worthy, and in disrepair. So. Here I sit. Alone. I'm working a decent job, to which most my money is gone before the week is out. I'm just so tired of the monotony of this life. I have no end goal, and thanks to the whore, I'm sentenced to celibacy and the loneliness that it accompanies. Also nb4 \"there's people with the same condition, blah blah\" fuck you. I wasted money on positive singles.com for an entire year just to have aids patients tell me I should die, or I'm ugly, etc. Mind you, these are people who paid money to be on this site that went out of their way to degrade me. I can't afford Healthcare thanks to this wonderful cuntry we slave for, so I've taken matters in my own hands. Over the past year, I've performed numerous surgeries on myself to stop, or at least slow the cancerous growths. Nothing has helped. I do have some medical training, so I wasn't going to cause more damage in my ventures, in case you're curious. But it continues to grow. By the week. I'm in constant pain all over my body. Whether it's related to the illnesses or something else, I'll never know. I've reduced myself to drinking copious amounts of cask strength whiskey, passing out nightly. My weekends are usually slept through, with an occasional bite of food and whiskey to finish. I'm tired of fighting for anything. I see this world gone to shit. People obsessing over their favorite celebrity or latest trend, and they can't even feed their kids or bother to help a neighbor. Look who our president is for fucks sake. This of course is just a snippet of what my life has been like. I want to write so much more about my experiences, but like the stars in this vast universe, my dissertation would be one among countless others. So, I've given myself one month. To win the lottery, to get laid, to find my way out of this country. All are equally unlikely, as I'm not motivated enough to pursue anything. After 30 days, my preferred choice of execution by hanging will be done in a peaceful setting according to the US army's drop distance table for hanging. I chose this solely because I feel when I gave up, I let down generations of strong men and women who fought for my future, as bleak as it turned out. And cowardice (was/is?) punishable by death. Also, hanging being one of the oldest tried and true methods. A bit of symbolism at the end. I write this because, well, I don't know why really. I'm not crying for help. My belief has always been that humanity is a plague on the earth, and either we leave to colonize other stars or survive until the next extinction level event. As George Carlin said, \"the planet is fine, always has been. It's the people that are fucked.\" I just want people to step back and see that life isn't the same for everyone. There's no equal opportunity, it's not in human nature. We judge from the outside, we fight, we step on others to succeed, we only help others to make ourselves feel good or better our positions. There's a select few that break the mold, but either you're born into money, or you struggle your life away chasing it. Side note: I have a practiced voice. I've been closet singing since I was young. I can croon right along with the legends like Sinatra and Elvis, give the diaphragm hell in matching James Hetfield, and even grace the higher notes of Stevie Wonder and Adam Levine (difficulty +10 on Adam). But, because I'm just an average white guy, no good looks or chisled body with good teeth, I've never been taken seriously. I get approached like some bummy fuck most places I go. Doesn't help morale much, and I've got severe performance anxiety from it. So to conclude my ramblings, I refuse to continue living on this path to destruction. I want to leave before this disease eats me. While I still have strength. While I'm young. While my morality is still intact. So. Thanks for reading, and watch more Star Trek. Start with the next generation if you've never seen it. Many good lessons to be learned. Also, the YouTube channel Vsauce. Michael Stevens has a way of explaining topics very well. \n\n-Q",

Growing up, I've seen firsthand the emotionally affects of alcohol on myself and my siblings. I didn't begin drinking until 21, but once I started, it quickly became a daily thing. I decided to stop, because I finally realized my drinking was not helping me, it was hurting me. I drank every day, 3\\-5 drinks a night. I sat at home alone, drinking. I could never stop at 1, and often drank half a bottle of wine, if not the entire bottle. By the weekend, I'd binge and wake up with killer hangovers that took 2 days to resolve. My brief days off were when I ran out of booze, and didn't feel like buying more. I'm a pedestrian, so I relied on Instacart and Drizly.\n\nI'm 32, and I'm also Bipolar \\(in remission\\). I've been diligently taking my lithium, however alcohol depressed my mood, and it would take me half a day to recover from the night's abuse. My lithium usage meant I no longer got the euphoric high from booze, I just got tired. However, I still kept going, and wasn't honest to my psychiatrist. I've called in hungover to my job several times. \n\nI finally decided to stop after seeing a Tasty article about cutting back. I downloaded a sobriety app and joined this community after a week, and my app no longer counted hours until next milestone. I decided I needed the extra support. \n\nStopping is the best thing. I now realize my alcohol use was fucking with my lithium. I am now clear\\-headed and energetic. I had some fatigue yesterday, but today I slept in and feel ready to seize the day. I attended a concert at a bar two days ago, and did not drink and was not tempted. It was the best I've ever been to. ",

   "selftext": "As all of you, I\u2019ve had a long journey getting to where I am so I\u2019ll try to save the erroneous details and keep this as brief as possible.\n\nI\u2019ve been drinking (too much) since I was about 15 and, now being 30 and married with two young kids, I\u2019m tired of doing this to myself.  It\u2019s been 14 days since my last drink (the longest I\u2019ve gone without a drink since starting down this path) and the last two weeks have been amazing.  I have been sleeping so much better, exercising more, having fun with my kids...just generally way happier than I have been in a long time.  Of course I still want a drink once the day starts winding down, but I\u2019ve been focusing on how much better I\u2019ve felt without it and have been able to turn down drinks offered by family and friends easily so far.\n\nMy problem is nobody in my family knows how bad my drinking is.  My wife knows I drink but, to her, it\u2019s been 2-3 on the weekend evenings and maybe once during the week.  She doesn\u2019t know about me hiding airplane bottles and sneaking an extra 2-3 drinks at least 5 nights a week over the last 5 years.  I told her I wanted to cut back drinking but, from her perspective, I don\u2019t have a problem.  She is supportive of me \u201ccutting back\u201d but doesnt get why I\u2019m doing it.  I know I\u2019ve been lying and still am lying to her but I\u2019m afraid of how she would react if I admitted to being dishonest for the entirety of our relationship.  I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m a good husband and father otherwise, I just want to erase this part of me without potentially destroying my wife\u2019s trust in me.\n\nI guess I\u2019m asking this here because I don\u2019t have anywhere else to go.  I come from a family of alcoholics even worse than me, and know they wouldn\u2019t be supportive if I talked to them.  I have good friends but I rarely see them since moving away for a job years ago.  All I have is my family and I want to do right by them.\n\nI\u2019m dedicated to stopping, but do I have a chance?  I\u2019ve always been a loner and want to do this without the meetings and whatever that comes along with AA, being around people just generally makes me very uncomfortable.  I like this community because it seems so supportive...I just know my story is one that not everyone may care to sympathize with.  I\u2019m still a liar, I know that, I just am looking for a place I can find support so the rest of my world doesn\u2019t have to know what a piece of shit I am.\n\nThat\u2019s all, thanks.",

Sorry if this isn\u2019t allowed. \n   So my husband is an alcoholic.  I can\u2019t even describe the feeling I had when I realized he was and that I was enabling. I\u2019d say it was a mixture of disgust with myself and him and just sadness. Now I\u2019m mostly just sad. \n   Three years ago he checked his self into rehab.  5 days later he walked out. He said he wasn\u2019t as crazy as the people there so he obviously didn\u2019t need it. That I just didn\u2019t understand. \n  Then we tried his regular dr. She was a a great doctor if a great doctor just shoved some pills at you and tells you that it will be all good if you just take these. So now he\u2019s taking antidepressants and hiding his drinking. Yay me right! I thought wow this is really working. We are really gonna be ok. Then I found his stash of empty cans in his truck and went through the bank statements. I\u2019m feel stupid. No wonder we didn\u2019t have any extra money. He spent 800 bucks on beer in a month. \n  Then last month he has an awakening? Epiphany? A sober fucking thought? He realizes he really is an alcoholic and he really can\u2019t stop. Cue the drama. He starts binging. And I mean falling down drunk by 3 in the afternoon and passed out by 7. But he is asking for help. Surely someone asking for help is serious. So I start jumping through the hoops. Get him in rehab again. Only this time we put him in a different state than us where he knows no one and can\u2019t just leave. Super happy. He seems to be doing what he should and he sounds much better on the phone after a month there. I\u2019m optimistic about this time. I\u2019m looking forward to him coming home for the first time in a long time. \n  So why am I still so mad? Why are my feelings still hurt? I miss him terribly and as much as I want him home, and am looking forward to him coming home, I still don\u2019t want him home. Why did he have to go to rehab for them to tell him the exact same things we have been saying at home? I feel like he has wasted my time and that this will just be another waste. I feel cheated on. It\u2019s almost the exact same feeling. It may not be a woman, but it\u2019s the same thing. He has taken time from us and our family for something he would rather be doing. And now that he is in rehab, I\u2019m expected to forgive and forget. Nobody and I mean nobody understands why rehab hasn\u2019t just made me a happy little camper. Nobody gets that while I am proud of him and have real hope that he is done, it hasn\u2019t even begun to fix the problems in our relationship. Rehab is not going to fix the fact that he cheated and couldn\u2019t remember it. That he knocked me down and can\u2019t remember it. It\u2019s not going to change the horrible things he has said to me and the kids that he doesn\u2019t remember. Rehab is not going to fix the fights when he passed out in the living room. It won\u2019t fix the neglect of our family or our relationship. You can\u2019t give me back the time I have wasted. And that pisses me off more than I can say. \n  How can I celebrate with you when my world is still fucked up? When I\u2019m bearing the brunt of all the responsibility? When you haven\u2019t been there for me emotionally for years but I\u2019m just expected to be your shoulder to cry on? Go cry on someone else. I don\u2019t care anymore. I\u2019m tired of this. I\u2019m tired of the ups and downs. I\u2019m tired of being there for him while he drinks his life away and goes through this cycle. And nobody gets that. \n  I guess I just needed to get that out of me. I appreciate this place being here. Thank you for this. ",

I felt like I couldn\u2019t have fun without being somewhat drunk. I felt like I had truly hit rock bottom when I woke up in a random\u2019s house with less friends than I had the day before due to some poor actions. \n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. Another teenager being melodramatic about her teenage problems, all that bullshit. But when you\u2019re my age you feel like the whole world is looking down on you, waiting for you to become something you\u2019re not. I got lonely and scared so I drank. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until New Year\u2019s Eve that I realised that I had an actual problem. It\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve, at a house party feeling like I\u2019m living my best life. Everyone\u2019s drunk including me, we\u2019re having a fun time and then in the next moment I wake up on the front lawn a few hours later. \n\nMy friends decide it\u2019s time for us to probably go home, so we all go back to my aunts free house. After a few hours, I\u2019m still drunk but now everyone\u2019s fallen asleep except me because I feel strange. \n\nI vomit in the sink, the acid burning my throat making me cry and then the pain kicked in. Never in my life had a felt a more excruciating pain than this. The muscles in my legs and my hands felt like something was crushing it, like someone was grabbing my muscles and gripping it so hard and tight. No matter what I did that pain was still there. I started crying again. Eventually I found that I couldn\u2019t breathe, I was literally gasping for air, my body shaking. The pain wouldn\u2019t go away and I was on the verge of a panic attack. Not to be melodramatic again but I was so scared of what was happening to me. \n\nIt continued on for what felt like hours the excruciating pain never stopping. I don\u2019t remember what happened after that but I woke up lying on the floor with a blanket over me. Later I found out one of my friends had come over because he heard me cry out. He tried to calm me down but it didn\u2019t work and I told him to go away. He left but then later came back to find me passed out so he put a blanket over me. \n\nI still have no idea what happened to me but ever since then I\u2019ve tried to stop drinking because I\u2019m scared it was because of the alcohol and it will happen again. I find myself reaching for a drink but I remind myself of the unbearable pain that came with it. I want to say that I stopped drinking because I wanted to and knew I needed to but it\u2019s because I\u2019m just scared. \n\nEdit: I also forgot to mention that my parents have no idea that I drink. My whole family is quite religious and would most likely kick me out if they found out half the things I have done. Don\u2019t get me wrong I love them more than anything and they love me but I feel like I can\u2019t talk to them about it.  ",

   "selftext": "Hi all\n\nI seem to have hit the end of the same road and thought sharing my story may lead to some suggestions which will ultimately get rid of this horrible thing \\- Alcohol\n\nI know this is a very long story so you don't have to read all of it, any comments to certain segments will be greatly appreciated, I just want whats best for my Mum and for her to be happy\n\nMy Mum has had a constant battle with alcohol for a very long time now \\(10\\+ years\\), she lives on her own with my brother, I have moved out but my brother is hardly there anyway, her Mum and Dad live close and she is close with my Grandma\n\nThere are a number of triggers which I believe have led to her turning to the bottle to escape on regular basis, such as her previous divorce from my Dad, my ageing Grandparents who inevitably will pass on in the not too distant future, a previous relationship with an alcoholic, possible the fear of being alone as she is single, high pressured work environment and a house which hasn't had much TLC for a very long time so is very messy and has numerous issues which need fixing\n\nHer drinking habits vary down to what stresses are happening in her life, at her lowest points she drinks every night and all day Sunday\n\nI believe it is down to the fact that she struggles with reality and looks to escape it when faced with an issue/problem, I am young so maybe it doesn't faze me as much because I am yet to face the horrible parts of life such as love and loss, death, health issues\n\nThe wheels come off usually down to an incident of some sort whether work related or something else which leads to the bottle, I nurse her through it then we get together and discuss how we are going to overcome it and things stay relatively normal for a week or two at most, then something happens and its back to the bottle\n\nThe solution I guess is how to control that scenario when face with an issue and turning to the drink is the first option as I have never been in it and from an outsider view it is hard to understand\n\nI ask her to confide in me when she faces this crossroad but I end up finding out after through either her phoning whilst drunk and crying or going around and finding her as a mess\n\nI try to do a much as possible to prevent it and pick up all the pieces when she is down but it seems I am fighting a losing battle\n\nIt effects me to the point where I lie to other family members and friends/work colleagues just to protect her\n\nI also sacrifice my plans and free time if there is an incident to help her and strategically plan things to her occupied to avoid her turning to the drink\n\nIt seems to be when she has nothing to do and starts to think about everything that she turns to it because that is the easy escape\n\nWe have been to the hospital a few times when I was younger as I didn't understand that she was just very very drunk, I just thought she was ill, but it also brings on illnesses such as cold/breathing difficulties/chest infections etc. Which when she does not drink she has control over but the drink just heightens their effects\n\nThere has been one incident recently where she could of quite easily had a run in with the law and because of it I feel this is the final straw and has lead to search for answers elsewhere by writing on here\n\nIf she does not overcome it then I feel she will get some serious health issues which may lead to the inevitable or she will find herself in a scenario involving the law and that will send her off the rails because she will lose her license and job and having a conviction in the industry she is in is not acceptable, so it would be a nail in the coffin\n\nShe also will not accept any external help as she feels this is the \"weak\" option even though I have emphasised over and over again that is it the harder choice to make, I refer to help such as depression pills, sleeping pills, going to alcoholic meetings so I am lost as to what to do\n\nIs it bad that I even think why should I help her and it is making me resent her for not accepting my help or suggestions and I think why should I suffer aswell if nothing is going to change, my life revolves around controlling it, it is my first thought when planning anything or when I am not with her, I even think if she dies my life would be easier but that is a disgusting thing to think and I can't help it\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar scenario and managed to escape ?\n\nI would never wish this upon anyone it is so mentally and physically draining it feels like I am living a restricted life and I will never break these shackels\n\nAlso my grandparents and brother are the only ones who are aware of her problem but not to the extent I know as I hide it from them\n\nAll I want is my Mum to be happy and not have the need to turn to the alcohol which will make me happy and content\n\nThank you, C",

It doesn't hurt anymore, except for occasionally feeling achy for a couple seconds. Recently I noticed a flesh colored spot around the cuticle and realized there was a break in the nail there. I figured the sooner the broken nail came off, the sooner a new one could grow in, so I decided to help it along. I started picking at the brittle parts of the nail, along the base and have picked away a pretty sizeable chunk, clearing away the dried blood as I went. But then I read that you're supposed to just leave it alone and let it fall off as the new nail grew in. Now I'm worried that by picking away at the broken nail, I made things much worse. Will my nail still grown in normally, after a few months, or have I screwed up?\n\nThank you!\n\nThis is a picture of my nail after picking away the brittle nail \nhttp://imgur.com/R2VmPKN\n\nThis is a picture of my nail a couple days after the injury \nhttp://imgur.com/xTXzFND",

   "selftext": "My first time in rehab was a little over two and a half years ago.\n\nGoing in I obviously knew nothing about addiction or alcoholism \\- I truly believed I drank because I liked it and I couldn't stop because I was weak. This is probably where a lot of us start.\n\nAt the time I was still in a long term relationship \\(toxic but I couldn't see it\\), had a good career, nice condo and two dogs. Alcohol had me on my hands and knees \\(literally\\) and I was slowly dying but other than that my life didn't look that bad from the outside. In treatment I met people far worse off from homeless to court ordered and when I heard their stories I felt guilty for being there because I wasn't \"that bad\".....YET\n\nI haven't been arrested, yet. I haven't been forcibly committed to psych wards and hospitals,  yet. I've never faced real health or life consequences from my drinking, yet. I haven't been truly depressed and suicidal, yet.\n\nSince then I have done all of the above and more. 6 rehabs and 3 sober living houses, seizure from withdrawal, more ambulance bills and hospital stays than I can count. Broken hand punching a cop during one of my many arrests. Alcohol cirrhosis and broken ribs. Lost my relationship, dogs, drivers license \\(from seizure\\),  career and damn near my mind, my family and my life. \n\nI now sit here exactly like the recovered alcoholics had told me back then about how bad things will get if you are alcoholic and do not seek help. I spent this passed Christmas in jail arrested for public intoxication and then rearrested while in jail for assault on another \"inmate\". I posted bail walked into a wine store at 10:02am and walked out with 2 bottles. I had no ID or cell phone or money nor did I care at all about the future. I drank the two bottles in the taxi home planning to book a trip to Mexico and end it all in a blur of hookers n blow. If it wasn't for my friend and whoever put him in my life to drop everything and drive down to me I wouldn't be typing this right now.\n\nThat spree went a couple more weeks until my friend manged to get my formed for 72 hours and it was exactly what I needed. He had taken me to the hospital prior but I would pull my own IV's out and leave. I spent those 72 hours really deciding whether I wanted to die or give recovery an honest go.\n\nMy friend picked me up from the psychward on the condition that I attend 1 meeting a day \\(he had spent those 72 hours speaking to doctors, counselors and AA\\) and took me from the hospital straight to a meeting. I've gone from hating AA to looking forward to it. I let my ego go and asked for help.\n\nMy life has gotten better 10 fold since I made that decision. It has NOT been easy \\- I was close to 3 months and slipped \\- I'm currently 43 days sober but in a far better mindset than ever in my recovery. When I slipped instead of self hate and pitty pot snowballing into a full out run, I went back to AA the next day and tried to figure out why it happened. Relapse is a part of recovery \\(but it doesnt have to be!\\). If you fall learn and get back up.\n\nThis has been a long rant and my first post here. I've been a long\\-time lurker but I haven't been to a meeting in a few days and figured this would help \\(it has\\).\n\nMake your sobriety your number one priority and realize NOTHING gets better picking up. Anything alcohol hasn't already taken from you is just on loan from the bottle its waiting to collect.\n\nMeditate, get out of your own head and enjoy the gift sobriety offers. This too shall pass and it WILL get better.\n\nThanks for the read ",

   "selftext": "Background:\n\n25, Male, 5' 10\" 222 lbs. Currently taking Indomethacin 50mg 3x a day. Ex cigarette smoker, current moderate (once per day) cannabis smoker. Recovering alcoholic, I drink less than 2 units of alcohol a week now, and no other current illicit drug use. Current medical issues include Hashimotos Hypothyroiditis. My most recent yearly physical (3 weeks ago) only showed low HDL cholesterol. Living in Canada. \n\nAbout 3 years ago I had a pain that started out relatively mild about an inch or so below my pinky toe. Over 24 hours the pain increased dramatically to the point that it became very difficult to walk.  If I had to describe the pain I'd say its a constant dull burning sensation, that progresses into an extremely sharp jabbing pain if I put even the slightest amount of weight on that area of the foot. Maybe a 5/10 for the aching, and up to an 8 or even 8.5 for the sharp pain. I went to the doctor who checked it out and said it was gout, and gave me a prescription for Colchicine and Indomethacin. The Colchicine seemed to help, though I didn't start taking it until pretty late in the episode, so it may have just been coincidentally getting better around the time I was taking it. The pain lasted about a week in total before I was able to walk properly again. \n\nIn between then and now, I've occasionally had some mild pain the same area when walking, but never anywhere near as extreme as the first episode. Additionally, a year ago my ankle on the same foot swelled up tremendously and I was unable to walk properly again for nearly a month. The pain was severe, but in a way felt distinct from my foot pain. The first doctor said it was a sprained ankle, though I can't remember doing any damage to it at all. The second doctor said Achilles tendonitis. I'm mentioning it only because recently I've been wondering if it's actually related to what's been going on with my foot. \n\nFast forward to this Friday, where I started getting the mild pain in the same spot of my foot below the pinky toe. Considering this has happened a few times before without progressing into severe pain, I just shrugged it off and began drinking a lot of water in case it was the buildup of a gout attack. About 15 hours later I woke up from sleep at around 3:15AM and the pain had become significantly worse, not quite as bad as the very first episode but still very painful. I went to the doctor again expecting to get a prescription for Colchicine, but the doctor seemed to think it wasn't gout at all. I wasn't positive on what he said due to his accent, but I think he said either Psoriatic arthritis or Osteoarthritis. He took some X-rays of my foot which didn't show anything. He then prescribed me Indomethacin.\n\nThe Indomethacin has succeeded only at making me nauseaus, and has done basically nothing for the pain. Cannabis seems to very mildly alleviate the pain, but not by much, though it does make it a lot easier to fall asleep through the pain. \n\nI'm looking for a second (or third, or fourth, or fifth, considering the number of doctors I've seen already) opinion on what this may be and whether the ankle pain could've also been related. The first time, when I was told it was gout, the doctor said my foot looked swollen and red. This time, it doesn't appear red and swollen at all, and the doctor didn't mention anything about swelling either. However, I'm confident both foot pains have the same cause. The second doctor seemed especially skeptical it was gout because he said he'd never seen gout in this particular area of the foot before, and because a physical examination allowed him to put some gentle pressure on the area of the foot without it causing a lot of pain. My diet didn't have any radical changes to it leading up to this event, though I did have a single beer about two days prior to first feeling the pain. \n\nCould this be gout like I was initially told? Or could it be some form of Arthritis? Some kind of tendonitis? Could the ankle pain have been related? This is beginning to cause serious strain regarding my employment. When my foot heals back up I'll be going to my family physician to discuss it and have a blood test done for uric acid levels. \n\nAs a small side note, all the toes on my right foot feel stiff and have reduced mobility. Curling them downwards is a little more difficult than my left foot but is generally painless, while pointing them upwards carries a significant amount of pain. Not sure how relevant it is. ",

   "selftext": "So this journey for me has been a long time in the making....  I knew I had an issue with alcohol for a long time but about 3 years ago I really started to reflect on how far I had slipped and had allowed alcohol to dictate my life.\n\nI had stopped being social or even reasonable about drinking.  I drank to get hammered.\n\nI still held it together, had a good job, family, etc... but I knew alcohol was a bad and big part of my life.\n\nBut I spent several years thinking I could moderate or taper or whatever....  that process took several years to prove to be totally futile.\n\nThen I had another 1/2 year thinking about totally quitting and what that meant.   AND I really struggled with it.\n\nBut I got to a point where I knew it was what I had to do.  What finally turned the corner was a writing out all the \u201cpositives\u201d of drinking and comparing them to the \u201cnegatives\u201d.  Wasn\u2019t even close\u2014the negative list was just straight up embarrassing and the positive list was really a joke and a cop out.   So cried and a lot and fought it but I quit.  Started counting the days...\n\nIt felt good... I knew what I was doing...  I could beat it.  245 days straight wow....\n\nFor whatever reason last thanksgiving I decided to have a social glass of wine with dinner...  well the f\u2019ing wheels came off the bus..... and for the next month I was damn near drinking every day again.\n\nIt was a total stupid situation.  Because I knew what I had to do but I kept saying well\u2014 if I was off the wagon I might as well blow it out.\n\nBut after a particularly big bender in front of the kids and family at the end of December (fell and hit my head, slurring words, fight with my wife, etc.) I was once again confronted with how stupid alcohol was.\n\nWhat positive was alcohol bringing in my life?  Nothing...really nothing.\n\nSo I\u2019m back to 142 days and this time I\u2019ve got a fresh perspective and strength about the whole process.\n\nIt\u2019s simple but powerful in that alcohol just makes me feel bad.  I don\u2019t gain anything from it.  And most importantly, the social situations that I used to dread not drinking at, Ive learned to deal with and still have a lot of fun at.\n\nJust had my 20th reunion and I had a ton of fun and stayed out super late but didn\u2019t drink.  It was empowering and awesome.\n\nI also know that I will learn more about myself the longer I don\u2019t drink and that is also great.  And I also don\u2019t worry about if it is forever or whatever\u2014-or label myself and alcoholic or make a big statement about it with old friends or post that I\u2019m clean or whatever.  I just want to drink anymore because it just flat out was useless for me and wasn\u2019t bringing anything positive in my life. Just negative stuff.  So why do an activity that doesn\u2019t help you in any way.???  Right ?\n\nSo I write this for anyone that is in the early phases of quitting...  just keep trying and find what works for you.  But also keep it simple\u2014is alcohol doing anything good?  My guess is no.  \n\nWhen you frame it really simply it is also easier to let it go.\n\nWe all know smoking or eating only donuts are obviously bad.  Alcohol is a toxin.  Your body doesn\u2019t break it down well.  So don\u2019t put it in your body. \n\nDo things that ARE good for you.   Enjoy life more.  Get work done.  Eat more fruits and vegetables. Talk more with your kids...  take time for yourself...  exercise.  Also live a little...have an ice cream cone now and again....\n\nLife is too short to feel bad all the time and be regretful.  Make a change and stop doing things that are obviously negative....",

Nobody noticed that my soda &amp; bitters wasn't a \"real drink\", and I realized that I enjoyed that night much more sober than I would have two or three beers in. I felt less anxious and was engaging just as much if not more socially than if I had been drinking. The night was to celebrate an old friend coming through town. I felt more present, more in the moment, and I'll certainly remember it better! They were all quite relieved when they realized they had somebody who could drive at the end of the night when they didn't plan well for it. My former alcoholic self even came in handy when they were trying to determine who was \"good to drive\" as part of my brain had been religiously keeping track of all the alcohol in the room and who drank which glasses when. And seeing them all get inebriated certainly made me glad that I wasn't acting the way some of them were : ). The friend coming through town was somebody who used to sort of be an idol of mine, who is about 10 years older than me, and now seeing them struggling with smoker's cough, I was very glad I had kicked that habit as well.\n\nAnyways, if somebody is reading this and facing an upcoming social event, worried that they'll feel out of place or enjoy it less, hopefully this can help ease your concerns.

If you are avoiding or anxious about a social event because you are worried you'll end up with a drink in your hand, please place your sobriety first. This is just some encouragement for those who are sure they can handle the not drinking part and are just worried about the social aspects. Dry People/Places is great advice and really important to a lot of people in recovery and I don't mean to be encouraging people to break that if it's a part of their recovery journey.",

The past couple of years we started hosting the holiday family gatherings. My SO (who was the restaurant manager but he left) has a small family and he is the youngest sibling. We found out I was pregnant with the first grandchild on his side. So we started hosting holidays so both families can be together for our daughter. She just turned one last week and I had a party for her on a day that all of his family could make it because it\u2019s hard to find the time. We invite them to every event without fail. \n\nSo when I called MIL to wish her a happy Mother\u2019s Day today and she tells me she\u2019s on her way to your house for a cook out for her my feelings were a little hurt. When I asked is sister and her boyfriend were going she told me they were. Why were we not invited? I always include you. We are never invited. Would you think that we would not want to come because I had Mother\u2019s Day plans? That\u2019s a piss poor excuse. How would you know unless you ask us? What are the excuses for excluding us all the other times? \n\nYour little brother, SIL and niece will continue to invite you over to our house. We will continue to treat you like family even when you don\u2019t with us. I will continue to take care of your restaurant. Just know, our feelings are hurt. ",

   "selftext": "My SO and I would get totally hammered together, we both liked to drink and really liked to drink together but I started noticing that I would stop after the weekend and he would just keep on going.\n\nI started to notice a problem with his drinking when we had our game night with friends and family, he would be so drunk he couldnt pay attention and then get upset with us for getting annoyed at him. It was so embarrsing to me. I asked him to please not drink before game night anymore, which he did...for a bit. \n\nAfter that night I feel like my eyes were open now, I noticed that he would be drinking at work (we work at the same place but different buildings) so we would met for dinner and he was drunk. It disgusted me honestly. He would drive us home and god it was scary but the whole time he would swear up and down he was fine while swerving all over the road. \n\nThe first time I actually talked to him about it was the day after he passed out on a chair and pissed himself. I was so so disgusted by that, I tried to wake him up and get him to change clothes so I would clean up his mess and he fell and hit his head. I was over it, I grew up with an alcoholic dad so I knew what was going on.\n\nHe said he would stop. He did....for a bit. And then, just like my father, he started hiding it from me. Under clothes in the closet, in the bathroom cabinets, anywhere he thought I wouldn't look (which I did. As I said above I know this song and dance) it took me months to work up the courage to finally say something to him again. He wasn t even completely sober like I wanted him to be but he said he knew.\n\nHe knew he had a problem, he knew he needed to stop. And he did. Cold turkey. It's been about 3 months and he hasn't drank at all.\n\nSo why do i feel bad? I feel guilty every time he tells me stories that involve him drinking, I feel like a hypocrite because I still drink on occasion, but he hasn't at all, and we did used to have so much fun drinking together. I feel like an asshole! Like I ripped away something fun from him. I talked to him about it a little bit the other day and he said he doesn't resent me and maybe one day hell feel comtobale enough to drink on occasion with me but he does look at me as a hypocrite. Ever since then I've felt so fucking bad. Even though since he stopped drinking our life and relationship has improved, I still miss our drunk nights together?? \n\nIt's very confusing.\n\n Thanks for reading my long ass post.",

The cause was [esophageal varices](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esophageal-varices/symptoms-causes/syc-20351538).\n\nI assumed he hasn't been drinking the past two years, though seemed to be addicted to valium. When I went home for Easter (I live about 4 hours away), I had suspicions he was tipsy/drunk which I haven't felt before for awhile. He was always high functioning: just a bit more relaxed, but never blacking out nor incoherent. As I assume the rest of you are, I've always been hypersensitive to these things since a child. I snooped around but couldn't find anything.\n\nBut after being sent to hospital, my step mum found multiple white wine bottles, full and empty, hidden away in one of the spare rooms. My dad's returning home tonight, and my step mum spoke with him. He first made a joke about it (\"oh, you caught me!\"), but then promised to not drink again.\n\nAt this stage, I'm hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. As I've gotten older and gone through my own reflections, a lot of what I've learned reflects the /r/AIAnon ethos. Ultimately, it's not up to me to help him nor feel compelled to control and monitor his drinking if he won't help himself. My anger is justified, but alcoholism is a disease. And, ultimately, I love him unconditionally and he has done the best he can. I am also reminded of such things as the illusion of free will and the illusion of the self.\n\nAll I can do is tell him I love him, treat him like an adult, and express how I feel. I'll also let him know I won't ask about alcohol, snoop around, nor direct my pain towards him if he has been drinking. But, if I am visiting the family home and I suspect he has been drinking, I won't be staying. I'll head back to my family home or stay with friends. I'm not sure if that's helpful? But it seems like appropriate boundary setting.\n\nFeeling a lot of things right now, but it's good to accept it's not my fault.",

I was around five years old when I had my first taste of alcohol. \nI had no clue what it was and I was not stealing it, I was ordered to finish the bottle.\n\n The person that gave it to me was my dad's best friend, lets call him Phillip and he was pretty much considered an uncle to me.\nI spent every second weekend at his house, my dad had me then, but you see he was too busy with his own habits to spend time with me. \n\nI was sexually abused by this person for years, without any knowledge of my family.\n This went on til I was eleven.\n That's when I discovered \"the benefits\" of drinking, so it become an everyday thing. I would take a bottle of vodka to school with me daily. \n\nWhen I was thirteen I discovered cannabis and tramadol.\n I continued doing these habits right through high school and of course the more you do something the somewhat more immune you become to it. \nSo my tolerance went up.\n It took me more and more to get the same effects.\n\n Around eighteen I moved into my boyfriends place and that's when things started getting risky. \nMy appetite vanished and my self hatred grew. I started starving myself and using anything I could get me hands on. \nWhen I turned twenty my body was rejecting everything i would put into it. \nI dropped to thirtytwo kilos and was doing weekly trips in the ambulance.\n Then something shitty happened. \nI was sexually assaulted by one of my boyfriends uncle at his daughters leaving party. \n\nFlashbacks started to happen.\n I couldn't cope with all the years of abuse I had blocked out and attempted suicide. \nNext day I wake up with a failed attempt of an overdose and questioning eyes. \nMy boyfriend knew everything. \nHe told me he couldn't do another night like this and that I needed help.\n So scared of myself I agreed. \n\nI was taken to an impatient unit where I spent two months. \nOkay so now I've explained some of my back story.\nIn the next part I'll share my diary entry's from those two months in care. \nIt's about to get intense. \n\nHope you all enjoyed part one ",

   "selftext": "For me, alcohol became a prison, and the funny/sad part is that I was the only one who didn't see the bars until they locked behind me.\n\nI'm 37, drank a bit in my early 20s, but nothing substantial(ish). My mid-20s saw a rapid rise in consumption that led to daily drinking. This lasted for about 2 years or so and then I calmed back down with it for another 2 years or so. Again, I was still drinking either daily or most days, but it was a couple of beers (no big deal, right?)\n\nAnyway, move forward to around age 28 and through a failed marriage and a subsequent relationship breakup after that, the drinking escalated again. By the time I hit 30, hey, calming back down. Fun cycle.\n\nAnyway, over the next 4 years, I drank a lot of beer, but it was never day drinking, never \"really\" had withdrawals. I did plenty of stupid stuff, passing out everywhere in the house, sheepishly wandering into the living room in the morning to gauge my wife's face to see if I said or did anything stupid the night before, forgetting conversations that were had or movies that were watched. It wasn't good. But hey, I wasn't drinking during the day or at work (I work for myself from home, btw.)\n\nWelp, over the past 2 years, it started to get earlier and earlier. \"Hey, I can have a beer at 3pm, no big deal. It's noon, why not crack open a cold one? 10:30am? Well, it is a Saturday and all.\"\n\nBefore I knew it, I was drinking in the morning. Like, first thing waking up, had to get 2 beers from the fridge and drink them in the bathroom. Started getting dry heaves in the morning too, but I made every excuse in the book as to why those were happening (the air is just so dry this winter.) Going sometimes days without eating anything at all...just beer.\n\nBefore long, I NEEDED to drink to go anywhere or do anything. Then it became about stopping at the gas station and picking up little malt liquor drink I could slam in the bathroom or down a backroad so I could avoid withdrawals if I had to go out. (Got called out by a cashier one time for that...talk about embarrassing.) Hell, I couldn't even go to see a movie with my wife without smuggling a drink in in my sock to drink in the bathroom halfway through. Otherwise, I'd sit there and twist and fidget and jerk around in my seat the whole time.\n\nMy entire life now revolved around alcohol. I had to plan EVERYTHING around where I would get my next drink. Taking an out-of-state family trip suddenly became a massive planning operation regarding how much I could drink before leaving, how long till we get there, what are the alcohol laws in the states we'll be passing through or staying in, does that gas station have a single occupant stall, can I go in and buy a drink and guzzle it without my wife seeing me make the purchase? I mean, I even would park strategically so that she would have no line of sight to the register.\n\nNow, I never lied to my wife or hid my drinking from her in the traditional sense, such as hiding bottles. Yes, I lied by omission in times like the above, but I know she smelled it on me. And she knew how much I was drinking at home. And yes, we had many, many, many, many heartfelt conversations about how worried she was about me. But, through it all, remember...I'm in control, I've got this. Never realizing just how slowly those cell bars were closing.\n\nThankfully, I'm now 12 days sober and I can see just how ridiculous my thinking and behavior was. I have tried to quit a million times, but after getting diagnosed with a gastric ulcer and fatty liver, I tapered down and quit. The bad news is that, the day after I quit, I turned yellow and had to end up in the hospital with sepsis and alcoholic hepatitis. I'm still working through that, but I've been assured that through abstinence and diet, I should have no problem making a full recovery in time. Long road ahead.\n\nI type all of this out just as a notice or a reminder that things can get really bad really quick. I NEVER imagined I'd be drinking in the morning. I NEVER imagined I wouldn't be able to go an hour or 2 without a drink. That happened to other people, not me...I'm smart and in control, right?\n\nSo, for anyone out there considering quitting, there has never been a better time than now. You can look at my tale and say, \"Well, at least I'm not as bad as that guy, so I guess I can continue to drink for a while longer\"...well, I used to tell myself the EXACT same thing when I would read someone's story of descent.\n\nI'm blessed beyond measure to have a loving wife who supports me and wonderful doctors who are also on my side (be HONEST with your doctors, folks!!) And I'm blessed that God has given me yet another chance to get my act together, a chance I will not blow.\n\nIWNDWYT or ever again. Be well.",

   "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI'm new to this board, but not new to reddit. I've been in AA for about three years now and identified as an addict. I'd tried a few drugs once, but never felt the need to try them again - therefore I identified solely as an alcoholic.\n\nThis has changed.\n\nNearly seven weeks ago, I went into hospital and was supervised because of a bad depressive episode mixed with trauma. I know my backstory of childhood/adult abuse would be a unique story among addicts. (Very briefly: I was raised Jehovah's Witness, segregated from mainstream society and culture so I wouldn't be unduly influenced by sin. I kept my homosexuality a secret, as well as physical/emotional/sexual abuse. I survived malignant skin cancer between the ages of 18-23. I survived a stabbing. A car accident. I survived several assaults while under the influence).\n\nWhile in hospital I was started on valium. I had declined before, because I could see problems forming with pain medication when I had operations for my melanoma and my parents (on one of the rare occasions they were right) controlled the meds. Very quickly I started enjoying the valium. I was lying to the doctor about my anxiety levels. I soon started double-dosing. A drink craving came while I was double-dosed and I acted on it.\n\nI'm over the shame of the issues around the Valium/relapse. But my problem is currently around my best friend. He's like family and he is in Al-Anon. He told me that six weeks is not long enough to have a problem with valium, that I was doing this for 'newcomer attention again' and that my actions were offensive to people who were legitimate addicts (whatever he thinks that is). Up until now this guy has been nothing but supportive. He's my only family because my flesh/blood family have shunned me for three years since I was excommunicated from their church.\n\nI tried explaining that, like most people, I learn from my mistakes. Maybe I wasn't a full blown addict, but I realise, upon analysing what led up to the relapse, I was forming a habit and that I'd been arrogant in my assumption that I was not 'a drug addict'. Maybe not every drug is a problem, but valium is and I now know even to stay away from prescribed medications.\n\nI can't help but wonder, is he right? Is this offensive? Have I done somethng wrong? I'm not looking for validation, and I certainly wouldn't relapse just for people to pay attention to me.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but I'd appreciate some help.",

My housemate has now been drunk for the past 48hrs and hasn't eaten for a similar amount of time. He hides in his room, doesn't let anyone else in, drinks goon and smokes. I'm pretty sure he pees in bottles up there.  \nTonight I'd made dinner and he said he didn't want any. He was in bed so I barged into his room, forced him up and made him eat some veggies and got some water down as well. He's now gone and passed out in his bed - he was pretty visibly plastered and to be honest I'm not sure he'll remember me coming in.  \nBasically I need some help getting him back on track. He's expressed that he wants/needs to stop drinking but just doesn't seem to have the willpower to get back on track. He's also heavily depressed but his psych put him on new drugs ~2 weeks ago that seem to be helping.   \nMy current plan is to get him up before I go to uni, make sure he eats breakfast and set him on the task of cleaning his room as a first step. I was then going to buy him a ton of mineral water and check on him a bunch to make sure he's not drinking. Other than that though I'm not entirely sure what more I can do. I feel bad for intervening so forcefully but I feel like if I leave him to his own devices it'll only get worse.   \nBasically I need advice from people who've been in a similar situation before. What can I do/say tomorrow morning to get him started in the right direction to getting his life back on track?\n\n\nEdit: problem has sort of solved itself.

   "selftext": "**The short version**\n\n28 years old. Man. Not working. Student debt and penniless. Degree yet to be finished. Left a good woman for sensible reasons. Messy family relations. Some emotional issues.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've been feeling increasingly self-loathing over how disappointing my life seems to be turning out, and I feel I have no one to blame but myself. I feel that I'm doing a poor job in the parts of life that are often considered most important - family/friends/love, career/mission, money/opportunities. Heck, I'm not even sure which part is more important to me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo please, tell me how to even figure out where I begin to work toward a more satisfying existence. I'm not greedy and I know that I can't have it all. All I'm looking for is companionship, enough means to live and have a few luxuries and maybe the opportunity to now and again do something cool or interesting.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The LONG version, if you want to know more about my situation.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy background:\n\nI came into fostercare as an infant, which is probably the greatest fortune of my life. My fosterparents are quite old by now (and dad's health seems to be going), but they've always been extremely supportive. They're always happy to see me or hear from me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOn the biological side I have my bio-mother, who I knew during my childhood, but cut contact with when I was around 17-18. She is bi-polar, which is why I was put into fostercare. I don't really blame her for anything, but I've never been comfortable with having family I feel like I belong to as well as family I only technically belong to. I've never known or been particularly interested in my bio-father, who was/is an alcoholic, who ran off around the time I was born. Good riddance, I guess.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEven though my relationship with my fosterparents is loving, it's somewhat distant. I don't come by very often, which I would attribute to the imbalance between their support of me and my ability to earn that support. I've brought it up, but they seem to write it off as nothing to worry about. But it still makes me feel a bit of shame.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDegree/work/finances:\n\nI did okay in country's high-school equivalent. A bit of a friendless outcast. Not that hard working. But my results were acceptable.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI tried out a humanities degree which didn't work out. I had no real plan for what I wanted to do with the finished degree. After about 3 semestres I dropped out and started working at a bar, where I stayed on for something like 2.5 years (in this time I met my ex-girlfriend).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRight now I'm on stand-by to finish a degree in journalism. It's been a struggle through and through, and I basically wasted two attempts at my final assignment; First attempt was around the time I broke up with the ex, second time I was pretty de-motivated and uninspired. And not working very hard or consistently. By August I will begin my last attempt at finishing, and I'm worried I'll mess it up again. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEven so, I've become disillusioned with the prospect of working as a journalist. It seems to be a frustrating and thankless job that leads a lot of people to spend much of their time trying to convince themselves that it is some special and noble vocation - while rewriting press releases and testing online headlines. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have student debt and I've only started living sort of frugally after breaking up with my ex and moving out last year. I don't have to start payments until I've worked for a year after finishing my degree, so that's something, I guess. But I have no savings and I have bad money-habbits.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLove life:\n\nThe ex-girlfriend I've mentioned was my first girlfriend (I was a very awkward teenager) and a few years older than me. She has her flaws, of course, but she is a wonderful person; Very supportive, trustworthy, funny, attentive, hard working. This all made it very difficult for us to finally reach the conclusion that we were not going to be happy together. After 5 years together, the will to work on the relationship had faded and we were steadily growing apart due to disagreements about what we wanted in life.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis part is weighing heavily on me these days. I've been trying out Tinder for a while. Going on dates and such, but none of them seemed to 'click'. I've gone out with friends and approached women with some degree of success; If I want to ask someone out, I can probably make that happen - and I'm not too concerned with rejection. Such is life. I do feel, however, that I become a bit awkward when I actually get together with whomever I asked out. I don't really know how to go from \"This was fun, let's do it again\" to \"I'm enjoying this and I think I like you.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's starting to get me down. Going from an intimate and familiar relationship to having to admit that several nice, beautiful people aren't going to be the one to bring that back, is frustrating. The lack of a sex-life (and I am not a one-night-stand type of guy) only adds to the frustration.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOn top of that, retelling women who I am is crushing; \"Yes. I'm a fosterchild, but that's just normal to me.\" \"Yeah, I'm going to finish my degree later this year.\" \"My ex? We were together for 5 years, but it didn't work out. Different plans.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEmotional stuff:\n\nI did have some anxiety issues when I was younger, but they seem to have passed. I've always been worried about genetics - if I'm at risk of becoming mentally ill, since it seems to run in my biological family.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFortunately, I have no dependencies other than smoking, which is bad, but not disruptive to everyday life. Like many others, I occasionally get too drunk, but friends have always assured me that I am not aggressive or unpleasant. I've gone along with drugs several times - mostly cocaine. But I've never actively sought it out and I'm trying to minimize my exposure to people who are into it. Basically, I would claim that I'm not self-medicating.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe one, big red flag is my tendency to obsess with death. I don't self-harm and I have never attempted suicide, but for a long, long time I've occassionally tried imagining how I might die. The conclusion is often \"I'll probably give up and off myself at some point.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPositive stuff:\n\nI know that it's important to appreciate the good things. The areas in life that are working out.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm actually quite fit, healthy and not too shabby looking. I work out almost every day and I eat a varied diet with lots of vegetables and not a lot of meat.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEven though I'm a bit angsty about it, I know that 28 isn't THAT old. My life isn't over.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI do have some things going on. I'm working on a project with an acqaintance involving audio production/podcasts. It may not lead to journalistic stardom, but it's interesting and fun.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn spite of struggling with my degree and being demotivated, I'm actually not half-bad at writing, interviewing and researching. I've received tons of compliments for my writing (well, maybe not this long-winded mess, but my short stories and journalistic articles). I also seem to have a good eye for details when I'm working on something that interests me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm also pretty good at picking up new skills quickly. As long as I have a reason to work at it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI don't have many of them, but I have really good friends. The type of friends that are pretty much family. I also have an excellent living situation sharing a house with other people. We all get along very well and are very supportive of and attentive to each other.",

   "selftext": "I have a terrible relationship with alcohol.\n\nIt's not that a drink everyday or can't live without it, but I just can't stop once I start. I can go a week or two without drinking fine, but I notice I just go to the extremes.\n\nI have lost 3 iPhone's so far in 2018, I also lost an iPhone in August 2017 which lead to an argument with my (then) girlfriend and her complaining that I'm not responsible enough and I get too drunk (all true). I lost another phone before I met my ex in early 2017. So I'm up to 5 phones in 12 months. If we go further back I'd say I lose a phone or 2 every year and nearly always while drunk.\n\nThis past weekend I got blindly drunk, uber'd home from a boat party I snuck into at 2am (I had not been home all weekend) woke up Monday and couldn't find my phone, I'd lost this same phone 7 days earlier - used find my iPhone and had to collect it from some African dude who found it on a train platform.\n\nI used find my iPhone at 2:30pm the next day and it showed it was like 20 metres from my house in the middle of a car park next to some houses on 1% batt - a full 12 hours since I got my uber home so I'm doubting the gps was accurate and that it's just in my house somewhere. I've been looking all week. I can't keep losing phones and buying new ones.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI spoke to my therapist last Thursday and explained how I felt. He said it's no surprise I'm choosing to go out and see people and drink, the alternative is being at home, alone, feeling guilt that I couldn't save my mum dying from cancer. I literally watched her die, the strongest most powerful person in my life, my rock and my comfort, reduced to skin and bones, unable to eat or talk. A skeleton, it still haunts me. I'm not close with my family, my grandma's second husband abused my mother, which ultimately killed her as she didn't go to smear tests as it was too invasive for her, but this allowed abnormal cells to grow in her cervix which developed into cervical cancer. By the time they found it, they predict she must have had it for 10 years. I thought I could have researched some natural remedies, alternative ways to beat cancer for her, instead I hid, I let the doctors and my family deal with her. But my therapist has helped me realise I'm not to blame and I couldn't do anything to save her.\n\nI drink and go out because the alternative is pain, and my therapist says it's a survival mechanism. Be charming, be fun, be around people.\n\nI'm at work and quite drunk, I went on a date last night and as I've not had a phone for a week, I bought an iphone 6s for \u00a350 from the sister of the girl I've always loved since school (will update that thread later). I didn't set an alarm and woke up at 10am today (I start work at 8:30am). I banged a girl who is the little sister of a girl that was in my class in school, this girl is now 25 and gorgeous. Anyway. I feel quite ****ed up and I defo have a drinking problem.\n\n",

   "selftext": "I posted a couple weeks ago about finally going to my local alcohol treatment centre. I\u2019ve since been to see them, acquired a key worker, and have been to two counselling sessions.\n\nIn the meantime, however, I\u2019ve been in excruciating pain, starting in my flank and radiating to my stomach. I\u2019ve been doubled over in agony, throwing up from the pain, unable to keep any food or drink down, and just been generally miserable. \n\nMy mum (who I live with; I\u2019m only 22) was adamant that the pain was something to do with \u201call the damage done by drinking\u201d. Whatever. I\u2019d read up on alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and knew that wasn\u2019t what was going on. \n\nI\u2019d missed two weeks of work due to fundamentally being unable to move without sharp pangs of pain. I\u2019d called the out of hours GP (I\u2019m in the UK - basically doctors who talk to you on the phone and assess, based on your descriptions of your symptoms, if you need to go to the hospital for emergency treatment) and he told me it sounded like muscle pain. My job involves a lot of lifting and carrying, so I thought maybe I\u2019d pulled something in my back and it had only just started to hurt. \n\nI tolerated the pain for a week more until I decided I\u2019d absolutely had enough. I couldn\u2019t really sleep for more than 4 hours at a time because the sharp pain would wake me up. I couldn\u2019t eat much because I felt so nauseated all the time. You know the feeling when your stomach decides to feign the sensation of being stabbed by a serrated knife to indicate to you that you need a massive fucking shit that makes you need to race to the nearest toilet lest you explode in your bloody pants? That\u2019s how I felt all the time. \n\nSo I went to my GP. He asked about my symptoms, prodded my back and belly a bit and then decided that I 100% had problems in my kidneys. Great. I provided a urine sample (no infection and no pregnancy, thank god) and gave me some stronger pain killers to hopefully help me pee out clumps of salt and stuff. Absolutely great.\n\nMy diet is good. I drink multiple litres of water a day (I even make sure I have a full bottle of water before I fall asleep, and often fill it up in the middle of the night because I literally drink so much bloody water), and my GP thinks that the only causation of stones is because I\u2019m an alcoholic.\n\nRenal colic is not fun. It\u2019s supposedly one of the most intense pains that a person can feel. It\u2019s excruciating. The average age of getting kidney stones is around 30. I\u2019m 22. \n\nI thought that being an alcoholic would only really affect my liver. Hellooooooo ignorance. Pumping poison into your body affects so much more than just one vital organ. It affects everything, from your mental health and moods to the other organs in your body. Hurting them by drinking is only gonna make everything worse for you in the long run. \n\nI like my kidneys. I\u2019d like for them to not hurt. I\u2019d like to keep them, essentially. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve permanently hurt my liver or anything else yet, but I know my kidneys aren\u2019t pleased with my alcohol consumption. \n\nI\u2019d rather be agitated and depressed over not drinking than experience renal colic. I\u2019m so done with harming my body. \n\nSorry for the length, but I\u2019m rather pissed off at myself for knowing for years that alcohol will affect my body without actually realising that ALCOHOL WILL FUCKING AFFECT MY BODY.\n\nI will not drink with you today.

   "selftext": "I obviously am an alcoholic, at one point I was drinking half a handle of vodka a day. Sometimes even a bit more. I would wake up and couldn\u2019t remember what I had for lunch or dinner the day before. So, it had to stop. My liver was so damaged I was hospitalized (although half of that was because the medications I take nearly all have liver damage as a side effect.)\n\nSo I started to taper off, slowly. I got down from 750 ml, to 300, and then maybe 200 ml. I got bold and went to 100, and then 50 ml too quickly. I ended up having seizures and went into the ER last week. I had the DTs so bad they put towels on the railings of my bed in case the seizures got really bad. I had an EKG Monitor that was mobile on me at all times in case I went into cardiac arrest it would notify the transponder in my room to the nurse station. I couldn\u2019t even be transported 3 floors up without a nurse or EMT present, lest I have a heart attack during transport.\n\nWithdrawals weren\u2019t as bad when I tried to quit on my own, which could have killed me (NEVER GO COLD TURKEY OUTSIDE OF A HOSPITAL! You can die, even if you are any otherwise healthy young person!)\n\nSo, I get out after 2 days, which isn\u2019t full detox, and I get the DTs again, and start drinking again to make it stop. Pathetic.\n\nSo, I\u2019ve dumped all the booze in my house and will be going back to the ER for a full detox of about 4 days. It\u2019s going to suck, because they won\u2019t let you eat anything but beef bullion soup and lemonade. They give you Ativan, so you won\u2019t have seizures, but expect to be woken up every 2 hours and have a bunch of EKG pads stuck to your chest.\n\nWish me luck. Hopefully I come out on the other end all good. Never go cold turkey outside a hospital; your life depends on it.",

   "selftext": "\\(TL;DR\\- from rock\\-bottom to Citizen of the Year!\\)\n\n12 years ago, I got an OUI, and was forced to attend a few local AA meetings as part of my probation. I was \\*not\\* sober, knew inside that I was an alcoholic, but I wasn\u2019t ready to admit that or quit. So I attended the meetings, sat quietly in the back and skipped out right away, after getting my little card signed. During one of those meetings, I met C, who was celebrating 16 years sober. The idea of 16 years sober was insane to me! I was impressed, it seemed like a super\\-human feat to me. He\u2019s about 20 years older than me, white\\-haired, soft\\-spoken. The idea of him being drunk seemed outrageous\n\nNow, I live in a small town, so I knew C by face, but after that meeting, we became slightly closer aquaintances, exchanging small talk in line at the post office, greeting each other by name at the grocery store. Eventually he gave me his business card \\(he is a handyman\\) and I hired him to fix a few things. He gave me a ride to work once and a while. We just became basic friends.\n\nAbout 5 years ago, I decided to try to quit drinking, and I started voluntarily attending AA. C was happy to see me there, even gave me rides to meetings a couple times. By that time, he had over 20 years sober, he is a high\\-ranking member of the Lions Club, as well as serving on local committies and working with the senior center and outreach programs here in town, and walking into any AA meeting with C was almost like being personally invited, like a voucher that you are the \u201creal\\-deal.\u201d I threw myself into AA, reading the Big Book every day, attending a meeting everyday \\(sometimes 2\\) I would speak up at meetings \\(when I wasn\u2019t sobbing\\), I got some laughs, lots of phone numbers, even went out to dinner with a group of people after a meeting one night\u2026\n\nAnd then\u2026I just drank. I made it 18 days before jumping off the wagon, abandoning AA, and reverting right back to my old ways. C called me a couple times but backed off when he realized what was going on. He never tried to guilt or shame me, never demanded I return, never even expressed disappointment. He continued to be my buddy, help me with soome work around my house, even when I was obviously hungover as shit, we\u2019d have coffee and talk about our kids and stuff about town, etc.\n\nIt took me another 5 years to finally get sober, and when I did, I didn\u2019t tell anyone for a while, didn\u2019t go to AA. I deleted my facebook, kept to myself, and this sub, and got through some rough times. By the time that I told C I was not drinking anymore, I had 30 or 60 days down and I was feeling confident enough in my commitment to tell him. He was so happy for me, without any kind of \u201ctold ya so!\u201d He just got all smiley and said \u201cAmi! That\u2019s great news!\u201d He told me anytime I want to go to meetings, he\u2019s still going every day,would be glad to give me a ride, and he also completely understood when I told him I felt I\u2019d do better without. We\u2019ve spent more quality time together since I got sober, he opened up about his past a bit more. He was not only an alcoholic, he was a crack\\-addict! Blows my mind to imagine that my kind and peaceful friend was someone I would not have recognized years ago! If he had not stopped when he did, the friend I have today would not exist, and for that fact, I am grateful for sobriety.\n\nA few months ago, C offered to get me a job where he works \\(in distribution\\) and it\u2019s turned out to be the best job I\u2019ve ever had! He also introduced me to a woman in town who is partially\\-disabled and too proud to apply for home\\-care. C has done a lot of work on her house, and I am now also a part\\-time housekeeper for her. Turns out she was one of the teachers at my high school, and rather than clean her house and leave, I end up sitting with her chatting out school, books, politics. It\u2019s not a lot of money for cleaning up a few times a week, but the feeling I come home with is amazing. I\u2019m helping someone, and she enjoys the company. It\u2019s hard to explain, but the first couple of times, I sat here and cried when I got home, just at how good it feels to do something that is making a difference in someone\u2019s life. When I tried to explain this feeling to C, he suggested I join the Lions Club. I\u2019m still considering; most of my life I have been the unreliable one and I\u2019m still afraid of making any kind of commitment to anyone, but I\u2019m getting there!\n\nAnyway, to wrap this up, I will get to the actual point that made me write this! My town has a big parade and celebration for the 4th of July, and there is a ceremony to award the \u201cCitizen of the Year.\u201d Working in distribution for our local newspaper, I\u2019m one of the first to see each week\u2019s headlines, and last week, on the front cover in full color, was the announcement that my friend C has been voted this year\u2019s \u201cCitizen of the Year\u201d! I am so proud of him, so inspired! I called to congratulate him this morning, and said, \u201cNow think back about 25 years ago, and just imagine\\- Citizen of the Year? You\u2019ve come a long way, baby!\u201d LOL\n\nI have never attended the award ceremony on the 4th, as the bandstand is not near the beer garden, and last year, I skipped the entire celebration altogether. This year, I have a reason to show up, front and center, to cheer on my friend and mentor! I will end this with one of the wisest things C has said to me\u2026we were sitting outside at work and I was playing on my phone, looked at my badge on this sub, told him I was on day 300 \\(or whatever the specific number was\\) I said something like \u201cIf you were on this site, your badge would be like 5 million days or something!\u201d And he said \u201cEh, we are both working on the same day\\- today, and today is the only day that matters.\u201d\n\nI am so proud of all of the people I am not drinking with today!",

   "selftext": "Took my mom to lunch yesterday for Mother's Day. She knew I stopped drinking but I never told her the extent of it - going to AA, having a sponsor, etc. We were visiting with relatives for a graduation and my uncle kept trying to get me to drink (to zero avail).\n\nAt lunch my mom told me that she was \"very proud of me\" for staying strong through the weekend. She also told me that she had been worried for awhile that I had a drinking problem. This stunned me a bit, because I was a secret drinker, tending to my habit mostly alone at night. Apparently it wasn't a well-kept secret. She had seen liquor bottles stashed around my place, and credit card bills left out (leave it to mothers to do a little snooping).\n\nI don't blame her for not saying anything before getting sober. I wouldn't have changed anything unless I was ready; and I wasn't ready until forty days ago today.

And, smoked cigarettes - something I only do during my weekly binge. Man, this sucks! I hate alcohol. I can't believe what a hold it has on me, and it's everywhere! I am young and healthy, but I want to stay this way! If I can stop drinking, I know I'll never pickup another nasty cigarette. A few months ago, I ended up having a bad batch of diverticulitis. I am going to use this as my \"safe\" reason for not partaking. I'd rather use this as the reason as opposed to the truth about my alcoholism. I surrender! You didn't beat me though. I will beat this, and I will be a success story. The guy who beat it. ",

But longer term it will make me angry and resistant as all hell. But I want to work with him, not frustrate him. So I am not sure. This is a bit of a vent, he is here in two hours, but it is a larger issue of him becoming somewhat insistent, scolding and blamey when I do not accomplish something he wants me to, nice though he is.

   "selftext": "Ok so I\u2019ve been an alcoholic for more than ten years now, last year was detox and rehab closely followed by relapse central with a fellow inmate of detox which lead to his death! \nAfter that of course I went mad with the drinking as I had a huge justification due to my boyfriends death. Then it starts to take its eventual toll on my body. No appetite, tired all the time, not to mention no money or proper social life (I drink alone). I begin vomiting blood and end up in hospital, each time they detox me, I swear I\u2019m done and try and get on with my life. I always go back to drink though like a person with low self esteem goes back to an abusive boyfriend. \n\nLast Tuesday I wake in the middle of the night and the familiar vomiting of blood happens except it\u2019s A LOT! I don\u2019t even have time to hide the empty bottles of wine I just call for an ambulance. I carry on being sick a lot to red clots and start to feel weird...I\u2019m dying, I just know it! \n\nI get to the hospital and I\u2019m being sick black liquid, it seems to be calming down and phew I think, a few days on a ward and I\u2019ll be ok. Then comes a huge amount of bright red blood, at least two pints then everyone is rushing around. I\u2019m panicking and feel like passing out. Machines are beeping loudly and then they\u2019re rushing me through the hospital corridors to the resuscitation room. I\u2019m grabbing every doctor or nurse and pleading with them not to let me die. I\u2019m given a general anaesthetic then all of a sudden I\u2019m waking up and they say they\u2019ve saved me and stopped the bleeding. \n\nI spend the night in the Intensive care unit then transferred to a recovery ward. I just got home after 5 days. The image of all that blood will haunt me forever, they\u2019re even talking about specialist procedures in a liver unit to fix the damage I\u2019ve caused by drinking. IM DONE! I\u2019ll be in a coffin if I carry on. I\u2019ve taken it too far. \n\nThe craving has already set in, I\u2019m detoxed so I don\u2019t feel ill but I\u2019m restless and bored but I just think of all that blood and how terrible I felt and I just know I have to take this one day, even one hour at a time. I can\u2019t go back, there\u2019s so much I haven\u2019t done or seen. I\u2019m only 34! ",

   "selftext": "Hey SD world,\n\nI\u2019ve been lurking on this sub for the better part of the past 5 months. I initially came here because I wanted to \u201ctake a break\u201d from drinking and thought I could read some helpful stories and advice. I ended up getting a lot more than that. \n\nI come from a long line of alcoholics (this knowledge alone should have been enough  to keep me away from the shit, but, ya know) and I\u2019ve only recently decided to face the fact that the disease didn\u2019t happen to skip a generation. \n\nI\u2019ve spent a longggg time convincing myself that I didn\u2019t have a problem anymore because I wasn\u2019t my 19/20-year-old self spending every weekend night showing doormen my fake ID, pounding 7+ Jack n Cokes and driving myself home because \u201cit was literally a 4 mile straight shot, what could go wrong?\u201d wow. I wasn\u2019t my 21-year-old self getting absolutely fucking obliterated any chance I had. I wasn\u2019t my 23-year-old newlywed self getting so drunk that fights happened frequently and were BAD. I almost got arrested that year for being SO belligerent at an Oktoberfest event I tried to fight a woman probably twice my age for booing the band that was playing...I got wrestled to the ground by security, my purse was stolen, and my husband had to literally beg the police officers not to arrest me because I was screaming and crying at them because they wouldn\u2019t help me find my purse. This story doesn\u2019t stop there...my husband finally got me into our car and I had a full on fucking snap...I tried to put the car in park on the freeway...I threw my phone at the windshield and broke it...I was completely out of control of my mind and body. The next few days were full of shame, but it wasn\u2019t enough to make me stop. \n\nI count myself incredibly lucky that the WORST thing that\u2019s ever happened to me as a result of my drinking was ALMOST getting arrested. I\u2019ve had way too many close calls to keep playing with fire. Yeah, I\u2019m not out getting blitzed and driving all over hell\u2019s half acre, but I\u2019ve had many a hungover morning facing the shame of shit I said or did the night before. I\u2019m tired of feeling embarrassed. I\u2019m tired of having to call and apologize to my mom because I acted like an asshole. I\u2019m tired of having alcohol-fueled arguments with my husband. I\u2019m tired of hiding the fact that I crave beer when I wake up, counting the hours til I can have one. \n\nSo today, I\u2019m 27, somehow still married, and blessed with a beautiful (albeit SASSY) 2-year-old and I\u2019m done telling myself, \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem,\u201d because I\u2019m not drinking the way I used to. My husband and I genuinely love craft beers and unfortunately that\u2019s enabled us to lie to ourselves and everyone else for so long. \n\n\u201cWe drink because we like the taste.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019re not drinking to get drunk.\u201d \n\u201cWe have drinks over the course of several hours.\u201d \n\u201cOur lives aren\u2019t negatively impacted by drinking.\u201d \n\nAlllll lies we tell ourselves so we don\u2019t \u201chave\u201d to quit. \n\nWhen I first found this sub, I read a lot of testimonies that made me realize I needed to check myself, and I did...for 2 days. I always kept the tab open on my browser, but I wouldn\u2019t read posts because I was learning that exactly what I was afraid of was true: I can\u2019t drink in moderation. I am an alcoholic. I finally nutted up and wrote down everything I was thinking, but too scared to say about my drinking problem and sent it to my husband before I could talk myself out of it for the hundredth time. He has quit drinking with me! \n\nSo, now I\u2019m back and on my 6th day of sobriety. This is the longest I\u2019ve gone without alcohol since I had my daughter. I don\u2019t want to be my high-functioning alcoholic parents, I don\u2019t want to hurt myself or anyone else, I don\u2019t want to get arrested, I don\u2019t want to be a drunk. \n\nAll of that to say, thanks for being here, guys. You\u2019re all an inspiration. \n\nTL;DR: I lied to myself, had a lot of close calls, decided to quit drinking. Hi. ",

Part of me wants to wallow and drink but that\u2019s not gonna help anything and I know that.\n\nSo instead of wallowing, I\u2019m gonna try to be sober for a bit and see where this takes me.

I was having a rough time with my family as my parents were beginning a nasty divorce and I started smoking pot to deal with the bad home life and my parent's kicked me out of the house for it. I stayed with my ex who was a year older than me so he had an apartment for a week until I moved in with a friend. That was the beginning of a very bad relationship. Years go by and we break up and get back together and have casual sex and don't communicate all while my substance abuse issues begin to really spiral out of control. Fast forward to two years ago and I am a full blown alcoholic and have just gotten back with my ex after a couple of months of him dating this girl I didn't like solely because he was dating her. He and I have an unloving, toxic, and drunk relationship for about a month until we dramatically break up. He and I (for some inane reason) wanted to \"talk it out\" so I invited him over to sit and talk. I am waiting in my livingroom when I tell my roommate that he is coming over. She gets visibly upset and tells me he has been sleeping with some other women behind my back and had been for a while. Right after she tells me this I look over and he pulled up on his bicycle. I lost my shit completely and started yelling and slapping him. I slapped him so many times and he never hit me back, he didn't even try to defend himself. Eventually he tries to leave on his bike but I, in my fucked up hulk rage, take it out of his hands and he is left to walk. The next day I left his bike on his porch with a note saying \"I'm sorry\" (a pathetic apology). He and I SOMEHOW end up attempting a relationship two more times after that until one day I realized I just couldn't do it anymore and broke it off for good. I didn't really give him a reason why because to me it was so obvious that I had abused him and we had a horribly toxic relationship and we were ruining ourselves by being together. Now, he has blocked me on all social media and has been in what seems like a loving relationship with a successful beautiful woman and I never spoke to him again. He deserves happiness to after being free from our horrible relationship but I am really struggling. Do I deserve a happy healthy relationship? I haven't been able to have one at all since our breakup, I can't forgive myself for being an abuser and I never want to do the same thing to someone again. I go to therapy and have for a while, I take medication but I am still depressed and mortified about who I was and possibly am. I don't know how to move forward and past it but I desperately want to. I want love in my life but I don't know if I deserve it. I feel like everywhere I go someone knows what happened between us and thinks I am a bad person. Idk, maybe I am a bad person. I don't know what to do and I am so tired of feeling so bad. I've alienated myself from friends and family because I just can't pretend to not hate myself and that is no fun to be around and they all deserve to be in good company. **TLDR: Had a long, toxic relationship. I went crazy one day and slap attacked him. He's moved on but I can't/don't know how to forgive myself and move forward.**\n\n",

I have had a lot of trouble coping with my mental illnesses, which I feel, plays a role in all this.\n\nBasically I've finally made a commitment to my therapist to stay sober from alcohol until tomorrow (my next appointment), and then go from there. This is really just a 5 day span from my last appointment, because I didn't feel like I could confidently say I would stay sober for a whole month so I'm taking it in steps, it feels easier that way for me. This is the first time I've even remotely stayed with it. \n\nTo put it bluntly, I feel as if my world is crumbling around me, I don't know who I am outside of substances anymore.

And now, as you can imagine, I don't have that, so my panic attacks are coming more swiftly, more often, more intense, and I don't have the alcohol to run to. I know my brain needs to find another outlet and I need to use better coping skills. I've been giving myself credit at the end of each day saying, \"I made it.\"That's all I feel like I'm doing is making it, floating through each day just trying to make it through, and I look forward to sleeping, I wish I could sleep all day, but I can't.\n\nMy husband has been my life these past few years, especially now. But I know, without a doubt, if he didn't stop me, if he weren't around I would definitely be drinking , and I hate that. Maybe with time I won't feel that way.\n\nSorry for the rambling, it's just a very tough time, any advice from former drinkers, or whoever would be greatly, greatly appreciated.

I never had an alcoholic in my life before my SO.  Every time I think it\u2019ll get better and it doesn\u2019t it takes a toll. I see the appeal in drinking especially when you don\u2019t overdo it. I see the appeal in trying to use it as a means to medicate. To just get by because I drank my first glass of wine to deal with his drinking. But first glass probably won\u2019t be the last. And he may leave or I may and that will stop. But the damage is done. I get it. It\u2019s an addiction but maybe I don\u2019t understand because I made a choice to have one drink and I made a choice to stop. How am I supposed to choose to leave? I think it\u2019s because I don\u2019t understand what it means to truly be an alcoholic. I just see you as weak as selfish. And I see I may have to leave and it\u2019s breaking my heart and soul but I told you if it came down to it I would pick myself my overall health over you. But why is it so hard.

I'm a loser guy in my late-twenties.\n\n*[First, I'd like to note that this is not an emergency, and I'm not in danger.]*\n\nI'm currently dealing with a recent breakup, obvious depression, anxiety, mild to moderate drug withdrawal issues... Oh, and I missed work today.\n\nJust couldn't go in. The commute is long (2 hours - minimum) and stressful (high, often chaotic traffic - with rainy weather today to boot).\n\nAs for the withdrawals, I'm doing everything I can to keep myself at ease, and gently taper off from my drug use. I'll have to force myself to eat again, soon. Right now, I'm resting. Just focused on relaxing and keeping myself calm and distracted. \n\nI term this my \"Survival Mode.\"\n\nMy vitals are fine. The main issue seems psychological instead of physical.\n\nI've been using drugs for multiple weeks (uppers, downers, and a dissociative) to deal with work, life, depression, recovery from alcohol abuse, and to NOT deal with feelings from the breakup (online long-distance; close to 3 years).\n\nI binged a lot over the weekend to de-stress and avoid the negative impact from the end of my long-term relationship.\n\n*[I never drove while under the influence of anything but low-dose stimulants and did not do heavy drugs at work.]*\n\nShe lived in another country and had three kids as a single mom. Realistically, It was never going to work, but I felt she understood me... Frankly, I think she was already growing distant from me, anyway. \n\nI've struggled with depression for over a decade, and I struggled with alcoholism/binge drinking for around four years.\n\nWhen I heard a certain dissociative drug could help with major depression, anxiety and addiction (when dosed under proper - expensive - medical supervision), I did a lot of research and obtained different dissociative drug myself. \n\n*[Obviously, this is not recommended! DON'T do what I did - I'm not endorsing any unprescribed drug use!]*\n\nThe dissociative I found online a little over a month ago helped me to stop drinking and craving alcohol. This is in addition to other supplements/drugs as well.\n\nTripping helped my life immensely. I was desperate! Work, life and financial anxieties were overwhelming me. I tried to be safe and I did extensive research, yet ultimately, I was often reckless due to said desperation.\n\nThis useful tripping on that dissociative came at the price of a close-call (family almost called 911 to get me to the emergency room), and it would eventually lead to my girlfriend breaking up with me. Multiple factors were involved pertaining to the breakup- not just the drug use. \n\nSo here I am now.\n\nI apologize for the long post and rambling. My situation is a complicated, hellacious, FUBAR mess.\n\nThere's still a lot I left out. \n\n**TL;TD**\n\nDoes anyone else go into a sort of \"Survival Mode\" when their depression and anxiety get really bad - where all you can do is shower, try to eat, and keep yourself sane and distracted? \n\n...Fuck. That is all. Please take care of yourselves! Hang in there, folks.",

I didn't really want to do it but it is a principle that you should say \"yes\" to the program. So I kind of begrudgingly said ok. Why was I hesitant? Well, a certain part of me, the part that likes to make excuses says it was because I don't want to make a big deal out of my life.

We need to focus more on other people and less on ourselves. Well, this sounds fine and dandy but the reality is that I was nervous. I was not really comfortable being very open with my life. Chairing a meeting requires honesty and vulnerability. It requires looking into your past and acknowledging where you went wrong. It requires sharing your struggles. It gets very personal and can leave you feeling very exposed. If you are not comfortable with yourself, with your journey it is overwhelming. Luckily, I have done this before and I have the experience to draw on. I knew what parts to leave out. There are some parts, like for example, my sexual history that if shared would have a tendency to get people stuck on that aspect of my life. They might walk away focusing on some juicy sexual exploits and while I have some tabloid worthy exploits that's not what I want to leave people with, so I left out some details. I did focus on my struggles in relationships, however. I got vulnerable and talked about how fearful I was in relationships. How I was dysfunctional in relationships, how I used to be very angry and yelled a lot. How I couldn't hold along term relationship, basically out of fear. I was never honest about my fear back in the days, I just basically turned my fear into anger and directed it at the women I dated. It was very childish and very toxic. I also talked openly about my social anxiety growing up. I talked about how I focused on my challenges and this made me angry and I learned anger from my father, who is a ragealholic. I learned to walk on eggshells and became very fearful of expressing discontent socially because I didn't know that people could have disagreements without it being taken to a very volatile level. In my relationships, I became volatile, it seemed like a safe place to vent, I suppose. It was learned behavior. I also talked about being able to acknowledge the good in my life. I am gifted in some areas. I have an excellent recall of detail. I am awesome at naming people who were in movies or tv shows. I also scored in the top 1% in the nation in math in highschool although I rarely studied. I was a C student in most of my math classes but when the sat's came I would score in the top 1% in the nation. Also because of my anxieties I developed a twisted sense of discipline and that discipline led to me being a somewhat accomplished long distance runner earlier in my adult life. I have ran a marathon, 3 half marathons and took part in several races ranging some 5k some 10k a very well known 12k a few times, a 10 miler etc. I always did well because of that ability to endure and the discipline I had developed in an attempt to control my life. ANyhow I guess I just needed to be open and honest and tap into the better me today. I needed to tap into the me that comes from a place of acceptance, a place of gratitude, a place of emotional honesty, a place of vulnerability in the hopes that perhaps I was being of service to another alcoholic, there were like 15 in the room. Anyhow, glad I did it.",

   "selftext": "So, this has been brewing around in my head since I wrote a college essay on this general topic, something about a person that inspired you. I chose my mom, and I used a paragraph to detail what a useless asshole my dad was for almost my whole life. He has a variety of mental issues and chooses to self medicate with vodka, a terrible plan even if your not an alcoholic and an EXTREMELY bad idea if you are, which my dad happens to be. \n\nSo he\u2019s been in and out of my life for so long that my moms fiancee, a person who is not by stepdad yet, has been a better father figure than my actual biological dad has been in 17 years. So I do my best to keep him out of my business. Currently we haven\u2019t spoken in 5-6 months, which has been fine by me, and I told my mom that. \n\nOut of FUCKING NOWHERE he calls my mom and is suddenly interested in talking again. And she brings up that I\u2019ve been ignoring him, something I truly wish she hadn\u2019t done. Because now, he keeps calling me trying to act like a father again. This has gotten so bad that he had his brother, someone I actually respect as a man and as family, to try and get me to come to where my dad lives under the pretense of meeting up. I know my dads using him, and I don\u2019t blame my uncle. I\u2019m more upset that my dad would blatantly use his own family to try and get me to come, ignoring the point I\u2019ve been trying to make by ignoring his calls. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not even that that made me want to post this. What I hate the most is the ARROGANCE he has in this situation. 6 months of radio silence and he suddenly arrives like he\u2019s Gods personal gift for me. NO. You don\u2019t get to come back and be a part of the celebration of something you didn\u2019t help with. I\u2019m graduating in roughly a month and I know he\u2019s calling because he wants to come. I kind of considered it, but after tonight I\u2019m more inclined to invite my uncle then my dad. He wasn\u2019t any more involved, I just looked to him as a better example. \n\nAnd if anyone\u2019s wondering, my soon to be stepdad is getting a Father\u2019s Day got with a card that says \u201cThanks for being more of a dad in 1 year than anyone else was in 17.\u201d I might text my bio dad. If I\u2019m in the mood to be a generous person",

Instead I was so excited to move my furniture around and set up the treadmill I got off Craigslist that I set myself up for complete failure. \n\nTIFU : I roofied myself.  I have two prescription pill bottles. Only two. One from my oral surgery in 2016, which I took before the appointment to calm my nerves. It was for four pills and I only used two of them. The other is adderall, which I take daily at 5am and go back to sleep until it kicks in, so I can function like a somewhat normal person. On Saturday we moved some furniture around and I cleaned out my bed side drawers and for some reason put these two bottles in the same drawer. This morning in the dark at 5am I did what I always do, open my drawer, fish around for the bottle, take a pill and put the bottle back, and go back to sleep. I slept through three alarms and my husband woke me up at 7, and when I picked my head up from my pillow and felt the swirl of my brain and weight of my skull I knew what I had done. I roofied myself. I had to embarrassingly call out of work and explain not only when/how I take my meds but what happened. Moral of the story : if you are going to keep mind altering drugs after a surgery for, I dunno an emergency??? Don\u2019t keep them with pills you regularly take sight unseen.

I never really realized she was an alcoholic though until I got older (19 now), I always just thought she had anger issues or maybe she was bipolar which is why her moods go up and down (I never blamed it on the alcohol. My mom hasn\u2019t had a job in a few years and when she did have one she was always at work drunk (she was a waitress) she ended up quitting her job when her coworker (who is the owners wife) died of alcohol poisoning. Anyways, that was a lot of precursor... but, now after many failed attempts my mom is trying to detox from alcohol on her own. She started on Thursday and everything got worse from there. She was vomiting constantly but then stopped after three days because she no longer has anything in her system. Yesterday she slept the entire day and when she was awake she was extremely confused. Today was even worse, I woke up to her running around the back yard thinking there were animals chasing her. She came back in the house and couldn\u2019t stop mumbling and saying that random animals or people were in the house. Eventually, she agreed to go to the emergency room.. which was at the exact right time. As soon as she got into the ER she started speaking in what definently didn\u2019t sound like English just very confused and not making any sense. She was very hostile and angry. She was then moved to the ICU and is currently still being treated there. At this point in the state she is in it seems like she is brain dead or has severe brain damage but maybe it is just the withdrawal. I guess I\u2019m just looking for some advice or past experiences. Most importantly someone to tell me that it\u2019s going to be okay.",

The majority of people would say that college was the time of their lives , but for someone who struggles with some pretty intense social anxiety and depression it can be torture.

   "selftext": "I hate that this has to be my first post... (long time lurker) I\u2019m not sure if this is the right subreddit but here I go. I apologize now for the length and  any mistakes I\u2019m currently not in a good mind set right now and this is coming from a desperate place.\n\nso here\u2019s some background:\n\nMe and my sister lived with my grandma for a few years when my mom was in jail for crack (which I still don\u2019t know the full details and I only found this out recently as in she was in jail for 3 ish years when I was around 5 and I\u2019m turning 19 soon). A while after she\u2019s out, we move into this small house and she had a kid ( my half sister) with a guy she met when she was in jail somehow (don\u2019t really know the full details lol). Anyways, they didn\u2019t work out and they divorced and soon after she found out he was cheating with someone at work. There was one time when they were together that she disappeared for 2 weeks without telling anyone (her kids at least) and he said she\u2019s on a business trip (which I again later found out she was not a business trip). They aren\u2019t together anymore\n\nAfter the divorce she was a bit of a mess but she pulled through. I\u2019m not sure which happened first but he got in a wreck and became paralyzed waist down. And we got a notice that my mom was in the hospital. We found out it was from an overdose. My half sister was just told she was \u201csick\u201d.  Let me not forget to mention she\u2019s also an alcoholic so that could\u2019ve played a factor in her OD too.\n\nShe started another relationship with a great guy, let\u2019s call him P, that me and my sisters adore, he\u2019s great. They were doing great until she relapsed. We decided she needed to go to rehab and he would take us to visit her while she was there. me and my sister lived with her close friend during this time and my half sister stayed with her dad. (I\u2019m still not sure when he became paralyzed so pardon my timeline).\n\nHer and P broke up for a while so she could work on herself. After this she was doing fine she got a job and went to AA and religiously went to church every Sunday. Her and P eventually got back together.\n\nshe recently started picking up and losing her jobs again and that was a sign that she relapsed again other than disappearing a few days at a time. at this point I can\u2019t trust anything that comes out of her mouth on why or how she lost them. \n\nI had a student account that was attached to her account so she was able to transfer money in and out when she pleases. During her joblessness she would ask to borrow money (even when I still lived with her) and I would let her for bills and shit. Then she would start taking out 100\u2019s by the weeks and  I would tell her to stop and she would let me know she\u2019s sorry and that she would pay me back as soon as she could.  And like the stepping stool I am I didn\u2019t do much. I couldn\u2019t say no to her... I didn\u2019t want to think what she would be doing for money and I had no guts to demand it back immediately because she wouldn\u2019t have an income. And I was secretly hoping she would transfer it back easier if she would do it easily on the bank app.\n\nI recently got a separate account because she wouldn\u2019t stop taking money from me. She now owes me near one grand. I cant help but to think I enabled it. There were many moments where I was out of a car and she offered me a ride and never showed up claiming she was too drunk and she\u2019s sorry. And I hear that she\u2019s at the casino moments after I see money missing from my account.\n\nMe and my sister moved out about 6 months ago (I got the new bank acc less than a month ago) and have to move again due to lease stuff and need every penny i can get. I was supposed to pay my part of the T-Mobile bill today (still on her account) and I forgot and now I\u2019m freaking out. My little sister is still living with her... if she is even at the house anymore... and I couldn\u2019t feel worse. I wish I could take her with me to the house I\u2019m moving into but I can\u2019t afford to take care of her and I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t want to leave her friend and go to a closer school. this move is drying up my savings. She\u2019s going into middle school right now and I feel terrible. Not only that but my aunt (who\u2019s also not right) is at that house and in my mothers supposed room and I heard now that P and her broke up again and she was usually at his house so now I wonder where she could be. I can\u2019t keep track of her because I don\u2019t live with her anymore.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do at this point. I\u2019m afraid of what will happen to my sister and I\u2019m afraid of what will happen to my mom. I feel like it\u2019s my fault because I knew and didn\u2019t have the balls to say anything to her. \n\nTo make matters even worse I just got Bell\u2019s fucking Palsy and can\u2019t move have my face and have to reapply for health insurance because I won\u2019t have the kid rate anymore. Everything just keeps adding up and I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nI\u2019m at my breaking point and I just have so much stress and I don\u2019t know what to do. Im lost and scared and tired of thinking about it and hiding in my room and crying.\n\nTl;Dr: basically my mom has relapsed, owes me a lot of money (I\u2019m moving this month and am a full time student and part time worker). I\u2019m afraid what will happen with my little sister and I don\u2019t know what to do I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for advice? Maybe just a vent( because I literally never talk to anyone about this and never had) Idk...\n\nLiterally 20 minute fucking update: I just heard from one of my future roommates that they won\u2019t be able to move with us after we already sent in a deposit. So my fucking living plans have gone to shit. I can\u2019t go back home there\u2019s no fucking room and no way I can stay in the house I\u2019m at now. Great. ",

   "selftext": "I have always had \"problems\" internally, regardless of how I seemed to others. Social anxiety for example. Most social interaction felt strained, awkward, or uncomfortable. Afterwards, I might ask someone else who was there, \"did I act normal?\". The response was usually \"yeah, of course, why did it not seem that way to you?\" I suppose I was just really good at hiding it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFunny, most of these problems were ones I didn't even know I had. That is, until I met someone that helped achieve some buoyancy and get my head above the water for long enough to recognize my plight: I was very anxious.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat was 8 years ago, and since that point I have learned more and more about what makes me tick, and why I am the way I am.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe first realization was that I was transgender. For the next few years I spent most of my time doing some internal questioning about what that meant for me and what the next steps would be. I even attempted transition, but found that it provided no benefit to me in practical life. Up until about a year ago, I thought this thing I knew about myself was the end-all-be-all. It explained everything I experienced, why social interactions were hard for me, and seemingly every other issue I could recall from my past. Or so I thought.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen you begin to dig really deep into gender and who you are compared to others, you may find that you aren't so different...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nStill, I knew what I needed to do, and that was transition, and transition I did. Soon enough, however, it became clear that my life was no better than it was before, just different. I had traded one set of obstacles for another without any net gain. So I gave it up, and went back to being myself.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat was about 6 months ago. Still, the question remained: if so many people out there are able to achieve a modicum of peace and success in their lives despite hurdles like that, why can't I?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI began looking at my upbringing. I found that from my perspective, my family seemed loving and relatively happy. I was the son of a single mother of two, who was the daughter of a successful stock broker and home-making wife, whom had 4 healthy kids, all who had kids themselves. We spent Christmases and Thanksgivings together as a family, with smiles and laughs and all the things you could hope for growing up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI had a father who tried to be a Dad, at least when I was younger, but had a lot of mental issues including addiction, alcoholism, and general assholery. Eventually our relationship went from distant to non-existent. I didn't know his family.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI loved my family, or at least thought I did...I'm not as sure now (since love itself is in question). Like I said, I have little outside perspective, so it's hard for me to see what issues there might be. And as a disclaimer: I'm thankful for what I've had. I really couldn't have asked for a better childhood, I had a lot of really care-free times as a kid. But since I have failed in all aspects of life, from relationships to work over and over, I have to ask questions.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCouple things to point out: almost every member of the family has dealt with anxiety or depression, or is dealing with them now. When we meet, it's almost an assumed thing that one of us is dealing with it at any given time, since it's hard to hide when you know someone. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSecond thing: Appearances have always been of utmost priority to my family. The general rule is: If you're not happy, look happy, or try to hide your sadness as best as you can. If you're angry, don't be direct, that might hurt someone's feelings or cause an issue, and we don't want issues.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've spent time with other families, and they might give each other shit, maybe even argue or fight from time to time. That NEVER happened in my family save for a couple of occasions. That brings me to the relationship with my Mom: We never fought. Ever. Disagreements were mild, with my mom usually relenting to my view on things to save from having hard conversations. Didn't do my chores? An exhasperated laugh followed by\"I really wish you would've done them.\" And then I'd feel guilty enough to do them. A couple years ago I started to realize that I felt like if I truly were to go against her wishes, she would abandon me. Whether that would happen or not, I don't know, but it was this deep, existential feeling that I could never overcome, and is still there. Like I'm on the verge of being abandoned by the only person that cares.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe also seems to be completely unable to offer any emotional support, though not for lack of trying. She will listen to me explain how I'm feeling, and try to offer solutions, but somehow I come away feeling worse. I've learned not to talk about feeling bad around her because things only get worse.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe also has some major depression and anxiety, and has never been one for group activities or going out of a pretty reclusive routine, so it makes sense that she would have no strength to give, though strangely has never shared that struggle with me. No one in our family talks openly about it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy sister fares no better, has her own issues, and besides that we don't get along very well and never really have.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter understanding these things, I realized most if not all of my family members function similarly to my mom, and while they might care, don't seem to be able to offer anything beyond an ear for listening. There is no call to action, no tough love, only sympathy. And I only know tough love because of my father, who used it as his ONLY way to show affection, berating or lecturing me anytime we met, which was rarely.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe reason I bring this up is because lately, I've been feeling very alone. I feel like no one cares, TRULY cares. Not enough to call me on my shit, not enough to do more than say, \"hey, hows it goin?\" and then small talk me to death.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI know all this makes me seem like a cry baby, like waaah-you had fun with your family growing up and weren't physically abused or anything, you should feel fine. That's how I see it, and yet, these feelings dominate my life.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is important, because the other thing I learned is that the world is a cut. throat. place. Holy shit. I thought everything was happy go-lucky when I was a kid, but it's a hardcore game of survival out there, and if you don't have support to get you through the hard times, you will either take what you need to survive or die trying.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm starting to rant, but it brings me back to my issue: and that is having a support system. I thought being trans was the problem and solution to my life. Yes, it is a big problem, but it can be managed by having people in your life that care about you.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMore recently:\nOver the last few years I have let friendships go the way of the dodo, all in the understanding that I was going to become this new person: a girl, and we would have to re-get to know each other anyways. Now that that chapter is closed, and those friendships that, in some ways, kept me afloat are mostly vanished.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo here I am, my superman-family is now just a bunch of people wearing capes, I have almost no friends, and I'm suicidal because I don't see a way out. The people around me who care, WANT to care, but don't have the means to do so because they're busy surviving themselves.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe truth is, I would be ok with dying. Like I said, I had a lot of fun growing up, and feel like I've had a good run (despite some issues). But I'm afraid of killing myself or I would've done it by now. I'm honestly surprised I've made it this long.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnyone else out there noticed a lack of a support system? How do you see that affecting you? *If this is something that you don't want to think about, don't let me goad you into doing so, just thought I'd ask for some perspective.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-D\n\n\n",

   "selftext": "I had a long distance relationship with a man who was diagnosed with BPD early in our friendship. He had just gotten out of a six year marriage, and has two little girls. He was in and out of hospital for months, for self harm and suicide attempts (at least six times?). I stuck by him and eventually friendship turned to love. And we dated. I went to visit him twice, the first time was great we had a lot of fun, he was amazing but something always felt \"off\". I had a sneaking suspicion he was pinning after his ex wife, and I eventually found this was true. He asked her back several times, while we were together. Tried to kill himself, when she got a new man but swore up and down he was fine with it. I was hurt by this, but I let it go because he wasnt in treatment and I know being divorced myself, it's hard.\n\nAnyways, a month after the first time I visited..he flew me back to visit for a month. It was ok, but there was glaring issues right from the first few days. He had a meltdown over shopping in order to cook for me, I don't eat meat but he does. He seemed to take my saying 'long as there's no meat, I'm happy' as put down? Or insult. He was so angry by the time we got to the car...he clenched his fist and growled as he loaded up the car, this was the first time I was actually a bit scared of him. Then as we drove out the parking lot he lost his mind over some lady pulling out...his reaction was so over the top, I moved over in my seat and tried to keep my distance. I wanted to go home then and there. \n\nI have a very abusive past myself (his parents beat him as a teenager) having been raped at 16 and in a horribly abusive relationship. My mom also showed BPD traits but was never diagnosed. I know now I saw so many traits of my mom in this man, and because my mom has passed....and left the huge unresolved issue that she told my ex husband she hated me..that I tried harder than I should have to help him. And put up with more than I likely should have. \n\nAnyways...we had a lot of push and pull in our relationship. Not just from him but me as well. I often wanted to leave, but got sucked back in and I let it happen. And I am working on it now. \n\nThings during my trip were stressed at best, he accused me of flirting with other men, which in one case I can some what understand...he told me to go talk to a table of Marines (he is in the navy). And I did. Six drunk guys, and one got aggressive..when I refused to hand over my number. So I finally gave him a fake number to get out of the situation that was escalating fast. My ex freaked out. Any time I so much as said hello to another man. But I never once cheated on him nor crossed any lines. \n\nHe broke his arm during my stay, and one night got drunk and proceeded to cut his cast off with a bread knife. And had to be recasted the next day. \n\nThen on my birthday i had enough and asked him to go back to base, because the anger and sulking was too much for me. He was really lazy, wouldn't walk his own dog. Played on his phone all the time. And just watched me while I did his laundry and everything else around the place we rented.\n\nThat night he drank two bottles of wine, and had slipped into quasi phycosis. He was on the phone with me, screaming at voices he heard, people who werent there and seeing people who had died. He was talking about demons, and quoting the Bible... something he had never done before. I was terrified. He basically blamed me. And the navy Dr put him on a heavy medication to calm him down.\n\nThen three days later..the night his parents came to visit, my first time meeting them (the same people who he said beat him horribly) we all went out drinking. My ex got extremely drunk (we were all drinking) but he was wasted (the meds likely still in his system). We parted ways with his parents and when we got home, all hell broke loose. He peed himself. And then proceeded to drink what left over booze was there from his dad. He then started to grab knives. And that's when I bear hugged him from behind, in order to prevent him from hurting himself. He resisted a bit. He is a lanky guy, but fit. And I'm 5'10 and 103lbs. So it was a struggle. He finally broke my grip on him by clawing my arm and biting my arm..while growling. Now given my past I have a phone app that you can hit one button to record. I had my cellphone in my hand because I was trying to contact the Navy Dr or anyone there to help. Granted I wasn't getting anywhere because it was 3am and my ex was not lucid enough to give me phone numbers. I ended up catching the bite on video and the aftermath. Of me calling the police. \n\nI had called for an ambulance, but after stating what happened...they sent the police. In Scotland the victim doesnt press charges, the courts/police do. He was held over the weekend and charged with assault. The cops took pics of my injuries within 15 mins of the incident. As did I. \n\nBasically my ex and didn't speak until weeks later, after I went home in the hopes that me not showing up to court, would have the charges dropped. Which it did. But my ex claims that was never the reason. In fact he claims it never happened. Even his ex-wife said in their six years of marriage he never laid a finger on her. Basically I was a liar. \n\nThis made me so angry, as I did everything to help him not be charged so he would instead get mental health help. Which he did. He was sectioned to a mental health hospital. And stayed there for the last almost four months. While there he cut his leg to shreds. Stopped eating in order to die. Tried to commit suicide. And finally cut his arm so bad he has tendon damage. \n\nAt first he hated me. Then weeks later I let myself be sucked back in again. It was the amazing idealization phase all over again. And I thought after he promised that while he never admitted to hurting me...ever. He says he can't remember..which maybe so. He had 12 rounds of ETC in the hospital...we could have a fresh, clean slate. No more bringing up the past. \n\nFor a while it was ok. Some push and pull again. He would call/text/email me endlessly, sent me $$$ in flowers...talked about our future,wanted to move here...bought me gifts...none of which I asked for. He was the sweet, amazing guy again... But then when we finally got on track, BOOM out of nowhere he breaks up with me... because he has too much to deal with and is sick of the going around in circles. He was freshly out of the hospital. And staying with his parents when this happened. I knew he wasn't well. He stopped his meds. Was saying he didn't think he had bpd. Because he had a job for 11 years. And was just generally a dick. Then one day it went from let's be friends...to him saying all he did was think about me. To bringing up that night again, and right back into calling me a liar. It was insane. \n\nI had enough and I let loose on him. I held very little back. Changed my cellphone number. And he emailed me back basically saying he had used deception to see how I really felt about him. Because he needed to know before he came to visit me. He then changed his email. Blocked me every where possible.\n\nI can't say I'm not hurt. I am. I feel very played with. And like he knew just what to do to hurt me and I know I let him. I also can't believe I fell for everything he said. When in my head alarm bells sounded for months. I know why I was drawn in. \n\nWhat I don't know is....why did this happen? That night went down exactly like I've said here and to the police. He says he showed people pics on my injuries and they all agreed that he couldn't have done it. He says he has had his butt handed to him standing up for women. Yet that night as we left the bar....he went after (yelling and swearing) at some drunk girl who insulted me...but I calmly dealt with. \n\nEveryone does seem totally fooled by his bs but me. And I can only imagine the lies and bullshit he has said about me. Which honestly? I don't really care. \n\nBut that said...I would really appreciate some opinions on what others think took place here? \n\nAnd what is the likelihood of him popping up again? I don't ask because that's my hope, it's my fear. \n\nSorry this was so long. \n",

   "selftext": "I\u2019m writing this on the morning of my 29th after posting in the daily check in. I\u2019m feeling very good.\n\n\nThey say the first 30 days is the toughest and they can be. For me, however, it wasn\u2019t so bad. The quote by one of my favourite authors, Haruki Murakami, comes to mind, \u201cPain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.\u201d \n\n\nThe pain of urges, of little niggles telling me to have \u201cjust the one\u201d, the memories of all the awful things I\u2019d done because of my drinking flooding back to me, the pain and embarrassment of telling close friends and family I\u2019m an alcoholic and therefore can no longer drink because it is killing me. The pain to my ego of going into my first AA meeting, and the acceptance I am an alcoholic. \n\n\nAlso, the physical pains in my stomach (and liver), the itchy and cold nights I cannot sleep, my head pounding, and my face still tender from being punched and kicked by family because of my actions.\nYes, pain is inevitable. Suffering, though, is optional.\n\n\nI didn\u2019t suffer in AA. It wasn\u2019t this miserable room where people drank tea and coffee and cried. It was a life-giving experience, uplifting, warm, and has it\u2019s truly belly laugh, hilarious moments. \n\n\nI chose not to suffer being around a crowd of drunks at my nieces Christening, and being tempted, by choosing not to go \u2013 on my own terms. *Shun me, if you want, but at least I\u2019ll be sober.*\n\n\nI didn\u2019t suffer with boredom because that\u2019s when it creeps up on you. I walked, I meal prepped, I hit the gym, I read \u2013 anything I could do to occupy my time for the better to stop me from drinking.\n\n\nWhenever I met new people I\u2019d immediately tell them I didn\u2019t drink. I didn\u2019t disclose why but just telling them I didn\u2019t drink was amazing. It shuts the offer of a pint down quickly.\n\n\n**0-5 days:** Couldn\u2019t make eye contact or be in the same room as my family. I was still withdrawing and felt like utter shit. I couldn\u2019t shit properly, either. I am starting to break habits of listening to sad music, and pitying myself. I discovered some new music instead. I bought a very good book, *The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober* by Catharine Gray. Hit 3 AA meetings in my first week. (Try doing as many as you can).\n\n\n**6-10 days:** Got back into the gym, started on a diet to help me lose all the alcohol fat. Colour coming back to my face, sleep still sucks but 10+ years on the booze will do that, I guess. The world is no longer spinning too fast, anxiety and depression is reduced.\n\n\n**10-18 days:** Making amends with my family and they\u2019re being very supportive. I realise they don\u2019t hate ME; they hate who I become when I drink. I hate that guy, too. We can laugh and joke a little. I get a part in a play because I\u2019m sober and can write an email and plan some things. I attend 2 AA meetings this week. I love AA now. It\u2019s exciting to go and just shoot the shit with people who understand.\n\n\n**19-25 days:** People are commenting how I\u2019m much happier I am. My sleep is so much better. I doze off easily and wake to the alarm. Jesus, who would have thought sleeping like a normal person would be so wonderful?! I went on my first date sober. It was the best first date I\u2019ve had. She knows I\u2019ve quit drinking. We kissed at the end of the night and have made plans for when she\u2019s here next (She lives in North Wales, I\u2019m in Liverpool). I am killing it in the gym.\n\n\n**26-30 days:** People feel they can now rely on me for things, like to cover their work shift or lend a hand. My mum sent me a wonderful text \u201cYou\u2019re in such a great place right now, and it makes me so happy to see. I love you. I am proud of you. Keep it up.\u201d Women are smiling at me. Am I handsome now? Life has returned to my eyes, my soul is back. I can look at myself in the mirror and smile.\n\n\n\nIt hasn\u2019t always been easy and the road isn\u2019t always smooth. I recognise factors which trigger urges and avoid them and people. I\u2019ve got a great network of supportive friends and family, my AA group, and stopdrinking. I know not every day will be sunshine and roses but things will always be infinitely better if I do not pick up that first drink.\n\n\nThank you for reading. Thank you, StopDrinking.\n\n\n\nI will not drink with you today. ",

Or hopefully it'll scare someone out of letting them self go. Either way here's a story. \n\nAt 23, I've become the complete polar opposite of everything 16 year old me thought I would become. I used to be an athlete, a musician, with a steady job always. I'm none of that now. \n\nIn late 2016 I was forcefully ejected from a musical project I started and put almost 7 years into Just as things were looking up. Shortly after I lost my girlfriend at the time, and with her my apartment and the two pets. \n\nDepression hit me like a brick. I'd never felt anything so enveloping and intense ever before if I'm being honest. So began an intense spiral of drinking all the time, feeling incredibly lost and not knowing what to do. I never sold any of my gear, but I never touch it anymore. I stopped doing martial arts, and therefore gained a whole lot of weight. I used to float around 140, now I'm close to 180. The most common comment I get when I see people I haven't seen in a while is \"wow you've put on weight!\" On top of that I spent so much money on booze and trips and trying to make myself feel better I launched myself into over $7,000 in credit card debt in a year.\n\nI still had a job this whole time, however it made me miserable. I had worked hard to line up a dream job of mine despite the depression (I work in the video industry) and the company hired me. Told me my definite start date was march 2018. So in mid February I quit my shitty unfulfilling job to prepare. March comes, company calls and says there was an \"administration error\" and they have no open position for me. Great. \n\nI had to move back in with my mother, who I am extremely grateful for as a support system. She doesn't have much and still she helps me when I've fallen flat on my face. \n\nThe drinking escalated into alcoholism, so it's extremely difficult to not go and blow money when I have it on my newfound addiction (currently 5 days sober - the longest in over a year and a half). I'm making very little money freelancing, and I cannot find a job for the life of me in this city. Credit card is maxed. Bill is due tomorrow and I have no money. \n\nI know all of this is self inflicted, from a bad reaction to an onset of depression. I guess if I can say any message it would be this: please please don't believe alcohol or drugs will help. Even short term. It's a slippery slope with very little time to get out. \n\nI have no idea what I'm going to do. ",

Say what?...\nI am 132 days sober \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf8a  and I have experienced many benefits already.  Unfortunately weight loss Isn\u2019t one of them ( that\u2019s another story)but health certainly is....... I was shocked because he hasn\u2019t seen me drink for awhile now, and I never drank beer before ....although I have had a couple of non alcoholic beer shandies on occasion.  I explained that he didn\u2019t need to drink beer to which he replied you and Dad do, I said yes but mummy doesn\u2019t anymore.  He said I\u2019ll have a fake beer then like you  mummy.... at which I am still mortified but  at least I heard him.  At least it\u2019s fake ( still gutted) but Thank god I\u2019m currently not in denial about my drinking or how it affects my child.  I told myself that I was a better mum after a glass of wine.... more chilled.  I do feel like I\u2019m shouting more these days but who knows...What I do know is that more chilled or not is irrelevant my son was already planning his future with beer in it,  due to my previous behaviour.  Also how many parents can\u2019t hear it, haven\u2019t heard it or are oblivious to the alcohol programming we as parents pass onto our children.  \nMy grandfather was in world world 2 and struggled with alcoholism when he returned, my mum is alcohol dependant, if I don\u2019t show my son a new way of being then who will. \nHe shows me everyday how to have fun without alcohol, I choose to show him a happy alcohol free future. I will not drink today x\n\n",

   "selftext": "Like most of us I started young, drinking in the woods with friends, long before any of it felt dark.  I was just a teenager in the late 90s, hanging with my friends and having some drinks.  It was an adventure, embarked upon by all of us.  A time to test boundaries and flirt with the edges of honesty (and all the cute girls).  It was fun, and mischievous, and exciting.\n\nFast forward a few years and a lot of us, myself especially, were still only focused on that adventure.  On the mischief.  Rebels against the monotony of existence.  Or however I romanticized it.  I had no real direction, but given the time and place and my reasonably good academic performance the path of least resistance carried me into college.  I was a computer science major on paper, but in practice my primary focus was on getting stoned.  I had side hustles to keep money in my pocket and kept up the bare minimum in my classes.  \n\nSomewhere in there, I broke up with the first girl I ever loved after she cheated on me with one of our mutual friends.  High school sweetheart.  There is nothing more utterly doomed and cripplingly dangerous as your first love, and  no more surefire way to have it blow up in your face than trying to maintain that feckless disaster-in-waiting over long-distance.  \n\nA shitty thing to happen to anyone, for sure, but I was already flailing.  Without realizing it until it was too late, I had made that relationship my tether to reality.  My insecurity soared.  My feelings of inadequacy rose to higher heights than ever before.  And I was angry.  Despite all of these tumultuous feelings I was still self-aware not only of how irrational my emotions were, but how I was presenting myself to the world.\n\nThis was a huge turning point in my alcoholism.  That relationship between inner turmoil and outer ease and confidence and impressiveness to others began to blossom.  The weekends were an absolute blur of reckless, aggressive partying, and when I wasn't drinking I was smoking pot.  I was living in a world of pure escapism in retrospect.  I'd started skipping most of my classes, and eventually realized that I'd fail most of them anyways, so I made plans to drop out at the end of the semester.  That final month consisted of nothing but videogames and sleep.  I had fallen into a deep depression.\n\nFast forward a few months living with my disappointed parents, and I managed to get a decent job at a tiny little office as a sort of jack of all trades \"computer guy\".  It paid enough for me to get an apartment with some other \"fringes of society\" type buddies of mine, and my boss was openly fine with me showing up high, so my listless existence of getting stoned and drunk every day continued.  \n\nI eventually quit that job for no good reason (I now understand that I was still in a deep depression). We dumpster dove for food.  I did odd jobs on craigslist for rent.  I dated psychotic weirdo after psychotic weirdo--all drunks, naturally.  \n\nAfter enough of that, I sort of hit a breaking point, and I turned that mechanism back on.  That switch in my brain to separate internal strife from external presentation.  So I lied on my resume and I got a real job, at a real company, making a real salary with insurance and everything.  Eventually I got my own apartment.  And my own liquor cabinet.\n\nI stayed in that job I hated for 8 years.  The IT department was a meat grinder, and I constantly used that employee turnover to claw my way up and up, until I was the most senior guy on the team.  It was an obscenely toxic place to work--it was not unusual to see people openly crying in conference rooms during meetings.  But what did I care?  I wasn't even really there.  \n\nI was a mannequin, and in a sick way I leaned into the negativity and the pain.  I liked it, almost.  I'd endure it, come home, and get absolutely blackout drunk with whatever weird girlfriend I was pretending to be with at the time, then wake up and do it again.  \n\nThere's a through line here, right?  From the moment alcohol entered my life, it became the only relief, the only true and constant companion, the only outlet through which I could experience myself and my life.  Everything else was performance.  I'd spend hours in conversations I did not care about or even remember the next day, purely to find openings for glib witticisms to impress people who I didn't even know.  I became obsessed with cleanliness--clean surfaces, clean car, organized closets.  \n\nRegimented.  Cold.  Calculated.   Until it was time to drink.\n\nEventually I again lied on my resume and applied for two different jobs and got both.  I played them off each other and there I was at 27 years old, a college drop-out alcoholic, making a 6 figure salary.  Socially and professionally I kept being rewarded for this false persona.  For this contrivance of my identity.  So I just kept going.  Kept leaning in.\n\nAnd the drinking got worse, and worse, and worse.  I became incredibly resentful of death.  I would think through gritted teeth about the fact that children would live to see the world as it was long after I was dead, and I vaguely hated them.  I hated a lot of things.  \n\nFast forward again, because this is already entirely too long and worthy of deletion, and I meet the girl who'd eventually become my wife.  We buy a house together.  I help her start a business.  We get a dog.  \n\nSo here I am, a lifetime of doing the bare minimum and lying to everyone about everything all the time to convince the world that I Am A Success, a lifetime of not knowing a morning without a hangover (which were slowly turning into withdrawals), and I'm living the American Dream.  I'm genuinely living a better life than 99% of the people in the world, at least on paper.  I start to wear this as a point of pride.  Like I got something over on the world.\n\nI liked my new job, and my wife was and still is an absolutely beautiful, hilarious person.  The heartbreak and insecurity that had sent me deep into the bottle so long ago was a distant memory now.  \n\nSo why couldn't I stop?  Why were my nights of drinking turning into mornings of drinking?  Why did I suddenly have this water bottle full of Tito's in my work bag under my desk?  Why was I so incredibly and deeply anxious all the time?  Why did my entire day still center around That Next Fucking Drink?\n\n32 days ago, I was 10 days into an absolute bender.  I was drinking a fifth of whiskey or vodka a day, plus 10+ beers of varying strengths.  I wasn't even blacking out because my tolerance had become so astronomical.  We had just sold our house at a huge profit, and were a couple weeks away from closing on a huge, beautiful, brand new construction house one town over.  I was excited, genuinely.  So why the fuck was I losing my grip?  \n\nI was so deep into it that I had started just coming downstairs to sleep on the couch after my wife drifted off, so I could be close to booze for when withdrawals kicked in.  I had no exit plan.  All my previous benders had ended with me and an Excel spreadsheet, neurotically planning a taper and structuring my life around it to minimize the collateral damage.  \n\nNot this time.  This was headed for suicide one drop at a time.  One morning, 32 days ago, my wife found me in the basement, holding an overflowing bottle of some disgusting cask aged banana flavored stout, struggling to get it into my mouth.  She was horrified and confused and exhausted in every sense of the word, and I'll never forget the strange laughter that surrounded her question: \"What the fuck are you doing?\"\n\nFor whatever reason, that hit me hard.  Two hours later I was on a plane to a detox facility.  I blew a .453 when they admitted me.  \n\nI could write another 10,000 words, easily, on the experiences both nightmarish and beautiful that I had there over the next ten days, but I'll spare you that until the next time I'm feeling wordy.  \n\nBut I got the answers to those questions above.  I had always been an atheist, or at least someone who didn't believe humans were anything but highly evolved animals.  And I had always mourned that.  I tried to paint it as freedom--existentialism over nihilism--but at my core I was simply deeply, heavily sad about mortality in general.  So I built a wall around it.  That kept it buried, away from my outward personality, which I crafted specifically to be \"impressive\".  \n\nThe more I worked on that exterior image--those clean, organized living spaces and sharp one-liners--the more that blackness festered.  I was closed off from other people, experiences, and even beauty itself.  I lived a pantomime of a good life, but I was dying inside.  Regardless of external appearances or bank account balances, deep down I was still that lost, confused, depressed 20 year old whose girlfriend chose someone else.  I had hit the pause button in the midst of that pain and I kept it paused for 15 years.  The further I got, the more external pillars I erected to distract from who I really was and prove to everyone that I *am* good enough, the more poisonous that blackness became.  It is no coincidence that at the height of my personal success I reached my lowest and most depraved spiritual point.\n\nI spent such a long time justifying my \"high functioning alcoholism\" with external factors to keep from looking inward, and while I am grateful I didn't go to my grave so \"emotionally unfinished\", wasting those years in that way is my biggest regret in life.  \n\nBut I'm still only 34.  And I didn't lose my great job or my beautiful wife or even that amazing house that drove me to the brink of oblivion.  Today, my goals are not practical ones, they are personal ones, spiritual ones even.  I seek every day to keep my guard down and remain open and vulnerable as much as possible.  Not everyone has to like me, or be impressed by me.  It is far more satisfying and fulfilling for one person to think that I am a compassionate, kind man than for 500 to think I am clever.  And rather than fight so futilely and bitterly *against* death and mortality, I seek to fight *for* beauty.  For the little moments that can utterly break your heart in the most wonderful way if you just stop wallowing in your bullshit for long enough to notice.\n\nAnd coffee.  Drinking lots and lots of coffee.\n\nIf you read this far, I'm sorry there wasn't a great payoff, but it feels really good to get this whole timeline off my chest.\n\ntl;dr - For most of us, drinking is a symptom.  The most important part of getting sober is finding the darkness that spawned it.  Be well.",

   "selftext": "The quote is from Leo Rosten, a sociologist.\n\nI am an alcoholic/addict. Recently quit drinking again, for a different reason than normal. I was planning on taking the GMAT in June and I needed my brain to work properly. So instead of going into this sobriety with the usual heartbreaking \"alcohol is killing me\" I went in with a goal of not drinking for 1 month while I study.\n\nI told a friend of mine (who I am infatuated with) and he immediately volunteered to quit for a month with me. He doesn't drink much and I think he suspects I have a problem with it.\n\nAll of this to say the last 12-13 days have been a different kind of sobriety. I am motivated to not drink because he is not drinking. He's asked me a few times if I was \"at the bar\" or something similar--which has only strengthened my resolve.\n\nSo how is this different from my usual quitting? Well I find myself wanting to drink out of boredom. I find myself wanting to go to the bar for something to do instead of a drink.  I actually drove to a bar the other day and just sat in the parking lot for a long time. I didn't want to drink because of the bet, but didn't know what else to do with my time.\n\nA lot of my time is spent studying and I have taken up walking/running 3-10 miles a day, but I still find myself with time enough to be tempted. Yesterday I took off from both studying and working out and by 6 o'clock I was just bored and wanted a drink.\n\nAll this to say, there are a number of reasons we drink, and it's important to have a solution to handle each one.  It's a habit that turns into an addiction and also an addiction that becomes a habit. Even if you have the will power to abstain you must be vigilant to recognize and avoid triggers.\n\nThanks for listening. IWNDWYT!",

   "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm 15 days away from hitting my '1 year' alcohol-free date (30th May), and am having many thoughts!  A very short summary of my situation: 24 year old Dutch student, between 2015-2017 my drinking got increasingly worse, with its worst at spring last year consuming 1.5 bottles of wine a night. Quit cold turkey and have learned a lot about myself and reasons that drinking got so bad (January this year got diagnosed for BPD). \n\nI see a psychologist each week which is helping tremendously (specialized in addiction recovery) while I await BPD treatment (1 year waiting list to start treatment..). 1 year sober was always my goal, but now the little voice in my head is beginning to speak up again (\"Maybe I can handle a beer here and there, you dont have to wait until after treatment for BPD starts\") . \n\nMy psychologist suggested to make an overview of pro's/con's of remaining sober after my 1 year mark, to put into perspective how well I've done and can continue to do. I would also love to hear your thoughts on how you overcame the feeling of 'I've reached my 1 year goal, now I can drink again!'. Practical applications (like the pro/con list), that worked for you I'd love to hear!\n\nThank you for reading and sharing your thoughts and advice. \n\n(sorry for any english language mistakes)",

I couldn't stand being the person I am with the decisions I've made.\n\nI last posted on here with 9 months sober. Now I'm sitting at just over a year. That one impossible solution, not drinking just for today, has been a mainstay in my life.\n\nThat being said, it's been more of a white-knuckle experience and the pains of not working a program are becoming obvious. I wracked with anxiety, fear, terror, ...more fear. A drink doesn't sound like a good decision right now, but I certainly wish I had a solution to change the way I feel.\n\nI substituted my alcohol addiction with work, the video games, then work, then books, then whatever I could get on my phone. I listened to an AA speaker last night about being joyous. I can relate to not wanting a drink, but I certainly wouldn't describe my disposition as joyous. \n\nA drink won't get me closer to a solution, but not working a program will get me closer to a drink. It's a strange triangle, but I'm seeing now that simply not drinking and going to a weekly AA meeting isn't going to cut it.\n\nI love this group for what it gave me.

Is mag citrate causing diarrhea supposed to last this long? also, he's had no blood in stool, no leakage. One doctor told him he might have IBS, but will IBS really cause all of this?

   "selftext": "Hello everybody, long-time lurker and first-time poster here. I recently reached one year (5/3 is my sobriety date) and have had an amazing experience working the program. Not only do I not drink, I actually am becoming a better person. When I first started this time around, I really took the first step 100% and accepted that I would never be able to control my drinking. So I'm committed to working this program for life, one day at a time. I chair a regular weekly meeting, I have a sponsor that I work the steps and do book study with, and I've got lots of phone numbers that I dial or sometimes dial me. Life's just plain better - not perfect by a long shot but much, much better. I no longer go to pieces as quickly when things don't go my way, and I'm learning to pause when agitated so I can do the next right thing.\n\nAnyway, my wife is a normie and while she is supportive of my sobriety and does a whole lot to help me, she's starting to feel that the program is taking more of my time than she would like. Most recently, I went to chair the Sunday meeting on Mother's Day and she was resentful that I didn't spend the day at home. I've explained that the disease doesn't take vacations, that this is good medicine for me, and that some time away from the house to do service work and get active in my group will pay dividends in the future. Thing is, when I was drinking I hid it so well from her that she doesn't really see a huge or obvious change in my behavior between me being drunk and me being sober. But I know inside that sobriety leaves me happier, more peaceful, and better equipped to handle life.\n\nSo, I've talked with my sponsor and some guys in my group. They all agree, from the alcoholic's point of view, that this can be a balancing act and some early tension in the marriage is normal, and that she will certainly like me better sober than drunk. And she agrees, logically, with the disease model and the idea that regular meetings are important maintenance. It's just starting to hurt her feelings that I spend some time away from home. But I have already cut down on meetings (I go twice a week instead of every day which was scary at first but has worked out well) and I really don't want to reduce them any further. I've tried white-knuckling things in the past and it absolutely sucked. So I know in my heart that meetings will be a part of my life and my routine.\n\nShe's not interested in Al-Anon, which is the most common suggestion I've heard, and I don't want to push it on her. I've brought home a couple pamphlets and suggested she maybe look at the \"For Wives\" chapter but she's not exactly enthusiastic to get a \"homework assignment.\" My therapist/counselor has offered to do a group session where she could explain recovery from a professional point of view but that's hard to coordinate with our work schedules. We are working out a schedule at home where my time away from the house is balanced by her getting an equal amount of personal time to go out, see friends, etc when I will be home taking care of chores and watching our kid. That's promising, but it's a very \"secular\" kind of solution that I think is only scratching the surface.\n\nAnybody got any advice, suggestions, or a similar experience I could learn from?\n\nThanks!",

I really wanted to ask her if she was drinking or not, but figured all it would do was result in a lie or make me paranoid.\n\n\nNow I feel good that I didn't ask her, but part of me feels like I don't care since I'm not concerned about her drinking when I'm not around (especially mid day).  It's hard to explain. I know I can't control it, but it feels weird to detach when it used to make me crazy, almost like I'm doing something wrong.",

   "selftext": "Hi, r/stopdrinking. \n\nI've recently learned the extreme extent to which my mother was abused as a child. The worst kinds of things imaginable. Because of this, she suffers from BPD, DID, PTSD, and depression. I didn't know until recently that she is also an alcoholic. She hid it from my siblings and me, and now that we are out of the house some things came to light. I don't think she has admitted to herself that she is an alcoholic, or if she just won't admit it to us. She can go days without drinking, but then the next day a 26er \\(750 ml\\) of hard alcohol will be gone. She has some incredibly destructive and abusive habits when she's drinking, and it's really rough on my father. It also mixes badly with her medication, and I\"m constantly worried about her to the point of having nightmares. I wouldn't be surprised if she drank herself to death, and soon.\n\nIt's made me question my own relationship with alcohol, and see the much, much, more sinister side of it. I'm not a heavy drinker\\- don't really drink throughout the week, but I can binge pretty hard on the weekend, and have a few hangovers a month. I've cut down on drinking, and I'm doing \\(trying to do\\) my first ever sober month. I've tried before, but it doesn't seem to stick. I'm really bad at giving in to peer pressure, and the FOMO is real. I think as soon as I tell myself I'm doing a sober month, something inside me resists and I drink sooner than I would if I wasn't \"doing a month.\" \n\nI'm not sure what I'm looking for. I guess it's just good to know there's a community here. I can't talk to many people about it, \\(hence throwaway account\\) because I don't want to betray all of my mother's struggles, and at the heart of it, that's why I'm doing it. Any thoughts or words of wisdom are appreciated. ",

   "selftext": "I had a long distance relationship with a man who was diagnosed with BPD early in our friendship. He had just gotten out of a six year marriage, and has two little girls. He was in and out of hospital for months, for self harm and suicide attempts (at least six times?). I stuck by him and eventually friendship turned to love. And we dated. I went to visit him twice, the first time was great we had a lot of fun, he was amazing but something always felt \"off\". I had a sneaking suspicion he was pinning after his ex wife, and I eventually found this was true. He asked her back several times, while we were together. Tried to kill himself, when she got a new man but swore up and down he was fine with it. I was hurt by this, but I let it go because he wasnt in treatment and I know being divorced myself, it's hard.\n\nAnyways, a month after the first time I visited..he flew me back to visit for a month. It was ok, but there was glaring issues right from the first few days. He had a meltdown over shopping in order to cook for me, I don't eat meat but he does. He seemed to take my saying 'long as there's no meat, I'm happy' as put down? Or insult. He was so angry by the time we got to the car...he clenched his fist and growled as he loaded up the car, this was the first time I was actually a bit scared of him. Then as we drove out the parking lot he lost his mind over some lady pulling out...his reaction was so over the top, I moved over in my seat and tried to keep my distance. I wanted to go home then and there. \n\nI have a very abusive past myself (his parents beat him as a teenager) having been raped at 16 and in a horribly abusive relationship. My mom also showed BPD traits but was never diagnosed. I know now I saw so many traits of my mom in this man, and because my mom has passed....and left the huge unresolved issue that she told my ex husband she hated me..that I tried harder than I should have to help him. And put up with more than I likely should have. \n\nAnyways...we had a lot of push and pull in our relationship. Not just from him but me as well. I often wanted to leave, but got sucked back in and I let it happen. And I am working on it now. \n\nThings during my trip were stressed at best, he accused me of flirting with other men, which in one case I can some what understand...he told me to go talk to a table of Marines (he is in the navy). And I did. Six drunk guys, and one got aggressive..when I refused to hand over my number. So I finally gave him a fake number to get out of the situation that was escalating fast. My ex freaked out. Any time I so much as said hello to another man. But I never once cheated on him nor crossed any lines. \n\nHe broke his arm during my stay, and one night got drunk and proceeded to cut his cast off with a bread knife. And had to be recasted the next day. \n\nThen on my birthday i had enough and asked him to go back to base, because the anger and sulking was too much for me. He was really lazy, wouldn't walk his own dog. Played on his phone all the time. And just watched me while I did his laundry and everything else around the place we rented.\n\nThat night he drank two bottles of wine, and had slipped into quasi phycosis. He was on the phone with me, screaming at voices he heard, people who werent there and seeing people who had died. He was talking about demons, and quoting the Bible... something he had never done before. I was terrified. He basically blamed me. And the navy Dr put him on a heavy medication to calm him down.\n\nThen three days later..the night his parents came to visit, my first time meeting them (the same people who he said beat him horribly) we all went out drinking. My ex got extremely drunk (we were all drinking) but he was wasted (the meds likely still in his system). We parted ways with his parents and when we got home, all hell broke loose. He peed himself. And then proceeded to drink what left over booze was there from his dad. He then started to grab knives. And that's when I bear hugged him from behind, in order to prevent him from hurting himself. He resisted a bit. He is a lanky guy, but fit. And I'm 5'10 and 103lbs. So it was a struggle. He finally broke my grip on him by clawing my arm and biting my arm..while growling. Now given my past I have a phone app that you can hit one button to record. I had my cellphone in my hand because I was trying to contact the Navy Dr or anyone there to help. Granted I wasn't getting anywhere because it was 3am and my ex was not lucid enough to give me phone numbers. I ended up catching the bite on video and the aftermath. Of me calling the police. \n\nI had called for an ambulance, but after stating what happened...they sent the police. In Scotland the victim doesnt press charges, the courts/police do. He was held over the weekend and charged with assault. The cops took pics of my injuries within 15 mins of the incident. As did I. \n\nBasically my ex and didn't speak until weeks later, after I went home in the hopes that me not showing up to court, would have the charges dropped. Which it did. But my ex claims that was never the reason. In fact he claims it never happened. Even his ex-wife said in their six years of marriage he never laid a finger on her. Basically I was a liar. \n\nThis made me so angry, as I did everything to help him not be charged so he would instead get mental health help. Which he did. He was sectioned to a mental health hospital. And stayed there for the last almost four months. While there he cut his leg to shreds. Stopped eating in order to die. Tried to commit suicide. And finally cut his arm so bad he has tendon damage. \n\nAt first he hated me. Then weeks later I let myself be sucked back in again. It was the amazing idealization phase all over again. And I thought after he promised that while he never admitted to hurting me...ever. He says he can't remember..which maybe so. He had 12 rounds of ETC in the hospital...we could have a fresh, clean slate. No more bringing up the past. That night. \n\nFor a while it was ok. Some push and pull again. He would call/text/email me endlessly, sent me $$$ in flowers...talked about our future,wanted to move here...bought me gifts...none of which I asked for. He was the sweet, amazing guy again... But then when we finally got on track, BOOM out of nowhere he breaks up with me... because he has too much to deal with and is sick of the going around in circles. He was freshly out of the hospital. And staying with his parents when this happened. I knew he wasn't well. He stopped his meds. Was saying he didn't think he had bpd. Because he had a job for 11 years. And was just generally a dick. Then one day it went from let's be friends...to him saying all he did was think about me. To bringing up that night again, and right back into calling me a liar. It was insane. \n\nI had enough and I let loose on him. I held very little back. Changed my cellphone number. And he emailed me back basically saying he had used deception to see how I really felt about him. Because he needed to know before he came to visit me. He then changed his email. Blocked me every where possible.\n\nI can't say I'm not hurt. I am. I feel very played with. And like he knew just what to do to hurt me and I know I let him. I also can't believe I fell for everything he said. When in my head alarm bells sounded for months. I know why I was drawn in. \n\nWhat I don't know is....why did this happen? That night went down exactly like I've said here and to the police. He says he showed people pics on my injuries and they all agreed that he couldn't have done it. He says he has had his butt handed to him standing up for women. Yet that night as we left the bar....he went after (yelling and swearing) at some drunk girl who insulted me...but I calmly dealt with. \n\nEveryone does seem totally fooled by his bs but me. And I can only imagine the lies and bullshit he has said about me. Which honestly? I don't really care. \n\nBut that said...I would really appreciate some opinions on what others think took place here? \n\nAnd what is the likelihood of him popping up again? I don't ask because that's my hope, it's my fear. \n\nSorry this was so long. ",

It is truly a gift that I\u2019m proud to have for 24 hours at a time.\n\nI am STILL learning patience and tolerance the hard way, but no matter what I dont drink! I\u2019ve had periods of daily meetings, periods of no meetings. Times when I did service 24/7 and not a lick of it- I dont do this perfectly, I just don\u2019t drink (and try my best not to be an asshole).\n\nThe biggest thing I hold on to is that no matter how bad I\u2019m feeling or what I\u2019m suffering through, there is another alcoholic who stayed sober through something similar or sometimes worse. They stayed sober to share the experience that it\u2019s truly possible to get through ANYTHING and not drink and I mean ANYTHING!\n\nAlso, for anyone young and struggling- I got sober in college and it is 100% possible to survive your 20s (or any age) stone cold sober and have relationships, jobs, misadventures, travel, make mistakes and have victories. It\u2019s never too early and it\u2019s NEVER too late.\n\nKeep trudging and thank you all for being a part of my sobriety today and every day before!",

   "selftext": "Been lurking on here for a few weeks now not bothering to weigh in on any posts, feeling I didn\u2019t have much to contribute.  But realized now I should pay it forward considering I get quite a bit out of reading other\u2019s posts. So for what it\u2019s worth, here\u2019s a random list of thoughts:\n\n* I never hit \u201cRock Bottom\u201d, at least not compared to some of the horror stories I heard in my early days of sobriety attending local AA meetings.  My wife &amp; I\u2019s marriage counselor (who happened to also be a recovering alcoholic) explained that I was getting off the elevator early and be thankful for it.  You don\u2019t have to hit rock bottom to know you have a problem and certainly shouldn\u2019t be a regret to have not hit whatever you define as rock bottom.  \n* Early on, I obsessed about the future\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m never going to enjoy some random microbrew again?? Never celebrate with a shot of tequila??\u201d. Took a while to just think in terms of the here and now.  Just focus on not drinking *today*.  \n* I tried to do the 90-days/90-meetings in AA.  Stopped going after about 2 months and haven\u2019t been back since, just didn\u2019t seem right for me.  However, I have hung on to the \u201cThis Too Shall Pass\u201d mantra and it has served me well in moments of frustration and doubt.  \n* While AA isn\u2019t for everyone, I would say that anyone ready to admit to themselves that they have a drinking problem should seriously consider attending a meeting. While I came to the conclusion that it ultimately wasn\u2019t for me, I\u2019m so grateful for the first few weeks of meetings\u2026forcing myself to admit to a group of people that I was an alcoholic helped hold myself accountable.  \n* About a year ago, I was close to tricking myself into thinking maybe I could start drinking and just do it in moderation.  Thankfully I chose to believe it doesn\u2019t work that way and the fact that I was needing to think in terms of \u201cmaybe if I moderate\u201d proved that I\u2019m not capable. People who don\u2019t have a drinking problem don\u2019t think in those terms. This is who I am.  I can get pissed off about it, feel sorry for myself about it, give in and drink about it OR I can move on and live my new life.\n\n",

   "selftext": "As the title says, I haven't been to sleep in almost two days and I feel like my anxiety is the root cause of this.\n\nHalf the time when I close my eyes, I can feel my eyes doing rapid eye movements. I'm incredibly exhausted but when I fall asleep I feel like my brain has literally forgotten how to sleep and then a deep wave of anxiety comes over me and I have a hard time keeping my eyes closed. \n\nI think I ended up dozing off for about a short while last night but I don't know if I actually fell asleep or if I was just half awake and conscious. And even that was for about an hour or so.\n\nFocusing on breathing makes it worse because I have asthma and manually breathing for extended periods of time just makes me want to use my inhaler and make my anxiety worse.\n\nI'd use an antihistamine like Benadryl to try to bring me to the point of sleeping, but I feel like it might have caused all of this to happen. I've been taking a single benadryl almost every night for about two weeks, and on Sunday night (the last night I took it) I ended up being really drowsy but just couldn't fall asleep. Although it didn't help that I also took the benadryl, worked out for about 20 minutes, and then tried to go to sleep a few hours later.\n\nI've also been somewhat of an alcoholic lately and have been drinking equivalent to a six pack a night, and I know that can play a part in keeping you awake but I've never experienced it to this degree.\n\nAnd then I did the worst thing you could possibly do by looking up diagnosis stuff online and came across the thought of me having Fatal familial insomnia, which is the absolute worst thing for me to think of when I fixate on the very small things and get terrible anxiety for it, especially because there's the chance that it *could* run in my family and I wouldn't know because I'm adopted. And then I just end up panicking from there, because what if I *do* have it, what the hell am I going to do?\n\nI kind of ended up ranting but I guess what I'm asking is, are there any recommendations on what I should do? Is this probably just anxiety related, and how can I crush that anxiety? I'm at the point where I feel like my body forgot how to fall asleep despite being so exhausted.",

   "selftext": "I'm an alcoholic. Have been for the past 6 or 7 years. The realization never hit me until last week. After all, I would tell myself, as long as I'm not like my parents, I'm fine. But my parents' drinking habits are the worst metrics to use when judging my own. Looking back on this past year, I'm realizing that I was drunk 5 nights a week (being generous). On weekends, I'd get up, distract myself for a few hours, and start drinking with the sun still up. And then other things started becoming clearer. This is like my problem with weed, with dieting, with the Internet. This is like my problem with everything I enjoy: I take it too far until I ruin myself in one way or another.\n\nI've been depressed for most of my life. I guess I never wanted to concede to myself that I had another issue on top of that. I wanted alcohol to forever be my one last vice I could cling to. And I was able to delude myself into believing that I am not like my parents. I felt so much resentment towards them for choosing alcohol over their children, for creating this family that looks so perfect outside the home but toxic and chaotic within. \n\nI guess alcohol is another thing I simply cannot enjoy. But now, I'm imagining my life without alcohol. What will I do in my free time if nothing else interests me? What will I do during those rare times I'm socializing with people in their mid-twenties like I am? What will I do when I'm stressed or down and I have no one to turn to? Who am I without my vices? I have no friends. My family is... not a group of people I can rely on. I have no hobbies, and the ones I did have, I can no longer summon the passion for. I have no job. I guess I'm just realizing the hard way that my delusions are not as convincing as I thought they were. I'm seeing the cracks now, and behind my ego I'm discovering a man -- no, a boy -- who just isn't a very great person as I once thought.\n\n",

The only thing I know is that she lived in a commune for a while until she became too hostile and mean for the group so they kicked her out.  Now, I have no idea where she is, but she manages to write my grandmother now and again so I know she is alive. \n\nSo here comes Mother's Day, and I haven't seen or spoken to my mother in 8 years.  I feel like I'm fine, and then I feel like I really want to sit by myself in my room and drink a bottle of wine.  So I did.  I started feeling like crap by the second glass, but I just felt like punishing myself with booze.  I didn't black out, I didn't do anything stupid, I didn't say anything mean, but the next day I felt like someone threw me off a cliff!  Absolutely awful.  A couple months ago a bottle of wine would have barely gotten me buzzed.  \n\nTotally not worth it, definitely punished myself.  Back to day 1, but I'm amped to get back in the game.",

   "selftext": "But I have no one in real life to talk to about it (except my therapist) so I feel a little lonely in my sobriety. So I'm here, sharing my small victory with y'all. Thanks for listening!\n\nSome backstory: I'm in my late twenties, have questioned my relationship with alcohol for a long time but kept those doubts to myself. I'd always try to do sober months to 'prove to myself' I didn't have a problem, but I'd never make it longer than 4-5 days at the most. When I was younger I used to be a really bad binge drinker - I've spit on people, hurt myself, had a knife pulled on me by a homeless guy and had to be pulled away from the confrontation by my friends, fucked people I had no intention of fucking -- all in a state of blackout/greyout. Things I would NEVER do sober. \n\nIn the past year or two though it's been less out-and-about bingeing and more consistent solo drinking. I'd get drunk in my room at least a few times a week and hide from my roommates. I was hungover and sleep deprived almost constantly. My anxiety was through the roof. In February, drunk and alone in my room, I made a noose and tried to find a place to hang myself from. Getting frustrated by not finding a sturdy enough spot and too drunk to really put things together, it was like this wave of fear and horror came over me as I realized what I was doing and I cried myself to sleep. After that I really tried to cut back but the pattern only got more toxic. \n\nAt the end of April I had two separate incidents that seemed to tell me I was standing on the edge of a precipice, and if I kept drinking the only way to go was down. Finally, FINALLY, something clicked in my brain. \n\nI haven't touched alcohol since April 29th. I have told my friends (who also drink a lot) that I'm taking a sober month, but I truthfully intend to never drink again. My mother is an alcoholic, and my grandfather hasn't drank since the 90's because of problems with it. So I know it's a genetic thing, and I was probably doomed from the start. But I'm not going to let my genetics dictate my life, and I'm not going to perpetuate my mother's toxicity and alcoholism. \n\nThings are going really well so far. I took a LOT of care to hide my problem from others, so most people I think didn't see me as a problem drinker, except for the few who saw the dark side of me. So that's a blessing and a curse. I hadn't (yet) burned a lot of my bridges, but I also don't have people who understand what a Big Deal this is for me. So I'm telling you all. :) \n\nI've finally got my sleep schedule more or less back on track, my face has lost puffiness and redness, my anxiety and depression has gone way way down and is easier to manage. I've been more productive and happier. I feel almost like I'm a totally different human. I'm not quite sure who that person is, but I'm excited to find out. I'm excited to stop hiding in drunkenness. I got a new haircut with all the money I saved and have been eating well, and exercising, and I feel like sobriety is like this secret superpower that makes me 100% cooler, nicer, stronger, more attractive, and more resilient. \n\nI don't want to get too cocky, because I'm sure there will come a time when I forget all the bad things about the drinking and a voice tells me I can moderate if I just try -- after all, that voice has kept me drinking for the past five years after I stopped enjoying it. But I'll be ready, because I'm not going to give up this chance at leading a rich and full life free from that pain without a hard fight. I know moderation, for me, is a lie. \n\nThe wonderful people over at /r/stopdrinking really helped me get through the first week or so, and I'm still there every day. I haven't gone to AA, but I do have a therapist who I recently told and has been amazing help so far. If you think you might have a problem as well, reaching out for help is so worth it, I promise. \n\nThanks for getting all the way through this novel. ",

   "selftext": "(TW for abuse, ableism, disordered eating)\n\nI was told by a friend to post my story here and ask for advice, if this isn't the right place to do so let me know and I'll take it down. Having said that, well... I'm not really sure where to start. I'll try to sum it up, but this is probably going to get long and rambling, so warning in advance for that.\n\nI mostly have fond memories of my mother as a young child (in elementary school), if she had ever mistreated me back then I think those memories are long gone. It was in middle school where she really started to change, but even then it was pretty different compared to now - I mostly just remember stuff like her hitting or kicking me, ignoring me if I said I was sick or hurt, comments about my appearance, my weight, my friends, ect. Back then it felt like outbursts of rage or just being distant and not caring, now it feels like more of a deliberate thing. \n\nWhen I made it to high school, things started to get really bad. I had been dealing with my mother's abuse and my declining mental health for years now, and I thought it would be easier on myself if I left public school and was homeschooled instead. At first I went to an online school, but due to problems at home I soon left that too. During that time, my mother was still actively hurting me, I had no teachers or real life friends to rely on, I had next to no resources and was basically left to teach myself, because of that I ended up dropping out of school when I was 16.\n\nI would find out much later that it was unfortunately all too common for children who were homeschooled to be abused or neglected by their parents, isolated from the outside world and from anyone who could help them. A lot of that definitely rang true for me as well. I had been alone in my home with my mother for years, and she only got worse and worse as time went by.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the way my mom abused me went from what seemed to be outbursts that she would usually apologize for when she cooled down, to deliberate attempts to hurt me. She always seemed to know exactly what to say that would hurt me the most, and just how to get under my skin. Despite having a history of breathing problems that had started to act up again, she smoked like a chimney around me. As my mental health declined even more, she began to use that against me, claiming that I wasn't REALLY depressed, I was lazy and a slob. I didn't REALLY have anxiety, I was just a brat who didn't want to take responsibility and used it as an excuse.... While also claiming that SHE had depression and anxiety, and I should feel bad for her.\n\nI had been told by some very good friends of mine that I should call the police and/or child protective services. I wasn't sure about it at first, but after she physically assaulted me and threatened the lives of my cats, I ran away and used a neighbor's phone to call the police. In theory, it was a good idea, and I trusted them to do their jobs, but to get right to the point - They didn't. \n\nMy mother was not charged for assaulting me, and because my father refused to press charges, she was sent home the next day. I was forced to attend counseling sessions where they bent over backwards to justify my mother's actions. I was then sent to a therapist who acted about the same, and actually told me that none of this was abuse or even serious at all, and my parents threatened to send me to a mental hospital if I left therapy. I was also put on an antidepressant, which I severely needed. It was probably the best thing to happen to me in a long time, and it did help me function better, but because of the way my therapist + psychiatrist mistreated me and all of the abuse I was still going through at home, I wasn't able to see that. I eventually got out of therapy, but because of a rule by the office, I wasn't allowed to have my medication if I didn't go to therapy. Social services never looked into us again. \n\nIn the time since then, my mother grew even more abusive and controlling. Up until a year or so ago, I wasn't allowed to do my own laundry. I'm still not allowed to have a phone, and I can only talk to people on her phone with her looming over my shoulder. The one time when somebody came over to visit me specifically, she sat with us the entire time, and we had to keep making up excuses to get her away for even a few minutes. I can only cook when she's around, and I'm not allowed to leave the house or buy groceries by myself. She constantly threatens to cut off the internet and by proxy, my support network.\n\nWhen I came out as transgender (trans man), she refused to accept it, and I had to fight tooth and nail for her to call me by the correct name, which she only does when she thinks I'm listening to her. She now uses it as more ammunition against me - She goes out of her way to show me pictures of myself when I was a baby or a young child, and makes a point of telling me I'll always be her little girl. Before, when I couldn't do something like carry a heavy box or open a jar or move something, she didn't care, but now she uses it as another way to hurt me, to say I'm not a real man and I never will be because I can't do this or that. She goes out of her way to tell me how disgusting and freakish she think surgery and hormone therapy are, and that she hopes I never do that. \n\nThe last thing I want to touch on is food. At some point during high school, we went from lower middle class to very poor. My mother went through one or two packs of cigarettes a day and also eventually became an alcoholic. Most of our money went towards that, and we had very little left over for food. While her smoking made it so she had next to no appetite, I was still a growing child. She knew this, and she made it a point to tell me that I was eating too much. No matter what I ate or how much of it, as soon as we were due for another grocery trip, she made sure I knew that I was greedy and selfish and wasteful, that we were in poverty because I spent too much money on food. Trips to the grocery store became nightmarish. To this day, I still can't figure out what is a normal amount of food and what's excessive. I feel guilty every time I eat, and because I feel guilty, I eat more, and it just becomes a never ending cycle. Even when I know I'm full and not hungry, I can still sit there for hours unable to think about anything but food. I can be so full I can barely move and still want to eat more and not be able to stop myself. Just a few days ago, in fact, she told me that somebody my age (18) only needs a thousand calories a day, and that in addition to that, I should be trying to eat less food and stick to low calorie food because it's cheaper and I need to lose weight. I didn't realize how horrifying that was until my friend showed me just how little that was. \n\nSo... here I am now, about to turn 19 in a month, battling mental illness and a horrible relationship with food, and still stuck under my mother's roof. I don't have a car, I don't know how to drive and I'm terrified of learning how to. It's probably just my bad brain talking, but I feel like I have no marketable skills, and because of my mother destroying my self confidence, I'm beyond afraid to get a job, to the point where I've gotten panic attacks just from looking at job listings. I also have five cats and would really prefer not to give them up or leave them here with my mother. I don't have any relatives I can stay with until I get back on my feet either. I know that staying here is just making my mental and physical health that much worse, and I need to get out, but I don't know how. It's terrifying. \n\nIf you read this far, thank you so much tbh, even if you can't offer any advice, it did help in the end to get things off of my chest.",

He told her there's a long line of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (i have aunts uncles and a sister who are diagnosed schizophrenic). Then she proceeded to tell me she was never diagnosed bipolar and only sought treatment for severe depression (not for very long) and i mentioned i have researched mental illness and more specifically personality disorders in my last semester at college and she said \"oh, that too\" and i asked her which one while naming a few \"borderline, dependent, anti-social..\" and she said with conviction \"borderline\", but told me she didn't believe the therapist because before the diagnosis they had her husband answer a questionare and she thinks he lied on it so she could qualify for disability in our state and be able to stay at home. If i wasn't already aware that me and her both have bpd I'm sure I'd believe her about him lying in favor of the disability thing but honestly i don't think he lied about her being \"moody and unstable\" because she always was throughout my childhood with occurences like throwing his clothes out in garbage bags in the street and tipping christmas trees because he was late coming home, it makes more sense than ever. I'm trying not to resent her for not seeking treatment, she's never even been on SSRIs or any other medication for a long period of time, but I'm just imagining what i would be like without being raised by emotinally abusive parents, a bpd mother and an alcoholic step father. I don't hate them or blame them because they are better now in general and if anything it helps to be able to connect the dots of my youth but wow my life would be so much easier if she sought treatment and if he got sober before he physically abused me and my sisters.

I'm a 20 year old female that is 130 pounds, in my current healthy weight range for height.\n\n So since about February this year I've been having on and off acid reflux problems. I did my first fun run in the beginning of March and I kind of just chopped it up to be an anxiety related thing because it seemed lesson for a week or two after that. \n\nIn late March/into April my acid reflux was getting worse to where I couldn't fall asleep, would wake up in the middle of the night from pain, and sometimes cry over the pain and nausea.

For years I maybe would have a few beers a night over the weekend and that\u2019d be it. \n\nThen a couple years ago, I found out my ex was cheating. I decided it was over and I should have fun too. I started to go out to bars for the first time since college. I continued to do so during the separation, on her nights with the kids. Looking back, I think I was just drinking to numb the pain and the mindfuckery of dealing with her. \n\nWe reconciled for a little while, (a big mistake) It was like a month before she was texting other guys late at night. I was really depressed after that and drank more for a bit, then I reduced it or stopped for a while. We lived together until last August, which was like hell on earth, but necessary due to finances. \n\nFast forward to this year and I did an almost dry January this year (a couple beers watching NFC championship game). I escalated my drinking a bit it through February, March, and early April of the winter that WOULD...NOT...END!!  \n\nI heard the real reason my uncle nearly died a couple months ago. He was a closet alcoholic and was going through alcohol withdrawal after a coronary bypass. That helped me decide to stop drinking until I\u2019m through my divorce and the house is sold.

Overall, I feel like I\u2019m able to enjoy my life again. \n\nMost important, those benefits mean I\u2019m really enjoying parenting my kids, playing, reading with them, and bringing them to their activities.

He currently drinks about 2-3 fifths of whiskey a week. Sometimes on the weekends he'll change to gin. He works full-time and is responsible. He pays his bills, has never gotten a DUI, never gotten into a fight, etc. The only problem is that he drinks a lot when he comes home (I am already in bed as I work 8am-5pm and he works 12pm - 11pm). \n\nI have brought it up with him multiple times that I don't like how much he drinks and that I think it's unhealthy. I think he's on the path to alcoholism. His father was in rehab last year for alcoholism and I can see him following that same genetic path.\n\nHowever, I've brought it up so much that it's a sore topic now. He claims I monitor his drinking too much and judge him (on more than just the topic of drinking). I'm not sure what to do at this point. He is very responsible and accountable, but I don't think the amount he drinks is healthy. We have been together for five years and I love him. He is my best friend but I don't like the path he is going down. \n\nIs there anything I can do to help him cut back? Is this normal drinking for someone who is 24 years old? Is it possible he will cut back naturally as he gets older? I know these questions are hard to answer when you don't even know him, but I need help in taking a next step. Maybe an intervention-ish, sit down talk? I'm at a loss. Thank you for any help in advance.",

We meet up every month to have dinner with the wine teacher (I am not her student, but I tag along with a friend who is her student). There is a wine theme for every dinner, and we each bring a bottle of wine according to the theme chosen. There is usually 13-15 people, so 13-15 bottles of wine per dinner. We usually finish over 10 bottles. By the end, everyone struggles to finish the bottles and I feel pressure to drink more when all I wanted to do was go home.\n\nLast Friday was no exception, dinner was delicious. After the dinner, we headed to a cocktail bar. I ordered one cocktail. Others had ordered two drinks each and we end up splitting the bill equally. I end up paying more than I should. That\u2019s fine. After last call, one girl who was kinda drunk asked the bartender to make our group one more drink. The bartender makes us a small cocktail shot. It tasted awful, and I end up having to pay for that shot as well, which I didn\u2019t ask for. :(\n\nI got home that night around 3am exhausted as hell. The next few days I keep on having dreams about my ex who had cheated on me and the girl he cheated with (which happened a year ago). In one of the dream, I saw them together and I slapped him in the face many times, I was furious. I wake up from the dreams with profound sadness, feeling of wanting to die! Why? Why do I keep having bad dreams? It\u2019s been a year already! Even my friends think I should\u2019ve gotten over it already!\n\nI came to realized that alcohol is fucking up with my brain.

I feel like I have a hole in my soul, and each day I wake up, I need to find things to fill up that hole.  \n\nAll these signs point to alcoholism and depression. \n\nI\u2019m glad I found this sub and hope you will all support me in this journey. \n\nThanks for reading.

   "selftext": "I quit drinking over 4 years ago, and in general have been doing very well since then despite a few small hiccups. When I first confessed I was an alcoholic to my boyfriend, he stopped drinking at home as well for at least two years, but he would still drink occasionally if we went out, or went to a party, etc., and very rarely to excess. I actually never asked him to do that ... he did it entirely on his own, and I consider him to be an extremely supportive person in general, aside from that\n\nAfter about two years of sobriety, I told him it was OK if he drank at home occasionally, because I didn't want my alcoholism to stand in the way of his freedom, especially now that I felt stronger.  At the same time, I believe I also mentioned that I would speak up if his drinking ever began to bother me, or if I had concerns, etc.\n\nWhich, of course, is what brings us to now. While his drinking is not extreme, it has become habitual (which I define as at least 2 drinks every day for the past 2+ weeks).  From my own experience with alcoholism, I believe the disease is very subtle in that it often takes years (or decades) to progress to the point where the individual's behavior begins to cross the line from \"socially acceptable\" into problematic. This can make identifying addiction problems in their early stages difficult. \n\nI plan on having a discussion with him tonight about all my concerns, but it's helpful (and cathartic) for me to get these feelings out in writing as well, which is probably the main reason for me posting. For instance, when I think of my own drinking, I am not sure what - if anything - would have gotten me to stop until I reached my own rock bottom. When I was simply habitually drinking, nothing would have gotten me to stop, so in some ways I feel like the disease needs to run its course until the alcoholic discovers what is really going on, and comes to some sort of epiphany.\n\nBut that was my own experience, and I'm not sure if everyone has the chance to come to that epiphany. And aside from that, and because his drinking is not yet extreme, I also wonder if I am somehow projecting my own disease onto him and seeing problematic behavior where it doesn't exist. \n\nHas anyone else been in a situation like this? How did it progress over time and how did you handle it? I sometimes feel like I am on \"the other side\" after entering recovery and am unable to see these issues clearly. On the other hand, maybe I am actually seeing everything incredibly clearly and I just need to be prepared. ",

   "selftext": "Some background for context on my situation. I went to rehab on my 21st birthday in June of 2012. After rehab I stayed sober for just over 5 years, but stopped participating in recovery after about 2 years. I was very bad off on \u201cspice\u201d when I went to rehab, because I was on probation and couldn\u2019t smoke weed. In August 2017 I decided that I should give social drinking a try, and quickly began smoking weed as it was always my favorite. In anticipation of graduating college I stopped smoking weed at the beginning of April so that I would be prepared to apply for jobs. I found that my anxiety skyrocketed, and I foolishly reached for the bottle in response to try and cope. My family has a history of alcoholism so I know how stupid this was, but I couldn\u2019t cope. I ended up holding it in the road and graduating Magna Cum Laude, but now I feel utterly lost. The alcohol I used to cope with the stress of my last few months of school is overtaking my life. I have been drinking more than 750ml of liquor a day, and it is starting to affect my relationships. I\u2019m too scared to stop because of the anxiety it creates, and some symptoms of withdrawal. I guess I\u2019m just looking for the answer I already know is correct. Go to detox, and seek out a recovery community. I just feel so much guilt over having to put the people I care about through this all over again. \n\nTL;DR: Drinking half a handle a day, feel like shit, feel guilty about it, know I should get sober, and just needed somewhere to share my feelings\n\nThanks for reading",

   "selftext": "[Before &amp; After!!](https://imgur.com/gallery/2cIgVxN)\n\nWords cannot describe how insurmountable getting to a year sober seemed only 365 short days ago. On May 15th, 2017, I was so scared to stop drinking that I took a Xanax to calm my nerves. On May 16th, I awoke sober, ready to confront my vices and commit to giving sobriety a whole-hearted attempt. I had NO idea what was in store. The first week I had two full blown panic attacks, but I did not drink or smoke or pop a pill to escape it. I sat and cried and hyperventilated until the worst was over. I had felt my feelings to their full extent and survived?!? That was new for me. \n\nA few weeks later, I dumped my open bottles down the drain, flushed my stash, and gave everything else away. I started putting more obstacles between myself and the first drink. At first I didn\u2019t really understand why *I* had to be sober. I hated being 24 and unable to party \u201cnormally\u201d like everyone else. Why did I always have to take things too far? Why did I want to escape myself so badly? Why didn\u2019t I care about myself or what could happen to me? Why me?? \n\nI made a list of things I will never have to experience again by not drinking. No more hangovers, no more waking up in strangers beds, no more ruined friendships, no more driving drunk, no more mixing drugs/alcohol... I rattled off two pages worth of \u2018never agains\u2019 and would refer back to it if I had a craving. \n\nFinally around 60 days sober things started to click. I realized I didn\u2019t *have* to be sober, I get to *choose* to be sober. I get to experience the full spectrum of life. I get to do the deep work on myself. I get to feel all of my feelings and notice all of life\u2019s miracles, things I never felt or noticed before, but were there all along. Trudging through the motions of life was no longer an option. Some days were better than others, but honestly my worst day sober will always truly be better than my \u201cbest\u201d day drinking/drugging. \n\nOne of the most surprising things of early sobriety was hearing stories of nights out from my friends where they\u2019d recall me being passed out or like I wasn\u2019t even there, when my memories are of me being social and fun. Weird right? There were times in the early days when I would look in the mirror and barely recognize myself. I was slowly unbecoming everything I wasn\u2019t, yet not fully stepped back into myself. \n\nEach day has started with the same promise to myself. I promise to do whatever it takes to stay sober today. Some days were easier than others. Some days I\u2019d eat ice cream and go to bed at 8pm. Other days I\u2019d be at a music festival and think \u201cno one would even care if you drank right now\u201d, except I realized that in fact, I cared. I cared about myself now. I couldn\u2019t escape my own actions anymore. I used to joke that my moral compass was broken, when in fact it was there all along. I can no longer act recklessly, cheat, steal or lie, because I have to live with myself full well knowing exactly what I am doing. Before it didn\u2019t matter what I did because there was always an exit strategy, an escape route away from myself. When that stopped working, I was forced to figure something else out. That something else has been kindness and compassion towards myself and others. To practice mindfulness, gratitude, love and care. \n\nSobriety has allowed me to get into the drivers seat of my life and take control of my future. Stopping self medicating was only the beginning to so many other changes internal and external. Everything inside me is different. The way I view the world, myself, my circumstances, my past, present and future is through a lens of love and acceptance. I never thought in a million years sobriety would ever be for me. I loved my vices like I love my closest friends, but sometimes when you close one door, a world full of opportunity is waiting for you. I know this year has set the foundation for a long, healthy and beautiful life ahead of me. Sobriety is the gift that I give myself daily, and the gift that truly keeps on giving. \n\nIf you\u2019re just starting off fighting the good fight, KEEP GOING. Even if you slip and fall, brush yourself off, figure out what you\u2019ve learned and carry the fuck on, warrior! We choose to live the way others won\u2019t, so that we can live the way that other can\u2019t. And that is living a life full of intention, purpose, passion, creativity, love and kindness. The world needs more people who are awakened in their lives. I love you SD. Without all of your stories and vulnerability I would not be here writing these words today. Thank you for being here and showing me that I am worth it, and that I\u2019ll never be alone in this journey. Here\u2019s to the next 365. \u263a\ufe0f",

Just spewing some thoughts because I\u2019m trying to get back to where I was before I let myself relapse and this withdrawal period is testing my sanity. \n\nSo it\u2019s been 3 sober days since Sunday; that was the night I decided to throw my sobriety to the wind and seek out my most toxic drinking friend and completely destroy myself on a bottle of absolut with him at his house. \n\nI knew as soon as I woke on Monday morning that this particular hangover was different. My state at the time could only be identified by myself and by my SO as glaring evidence of the scary problem I have. My old hangovers were just that- hangovers. That was before I became honest with myself and with the people closest to me about how important it is that I no longer drink. Now? No. \n\nSince becoming sober, I've noticed something happens during the times I managed to talk myself into believing in the idea of moderation. As soon as I let my guard down and have that first drink, my inner alcoholic becomes so frantic to get loaded that I end up nearly killing myself with alcohol poisoning. My brain starts running entirely on this \"now or never, all or nothing\" kind of vibe. And I can't control it. \n\nThis hangover has been so persistent and sinister. I miss my sober brain so much. I just want to be a few weeks sober again. It's been three days and I'm still so exhausted, bloated, and totally worthless. I still feel almost more hungover three days later, today, than I used to feel the morning after drinking. The blood in my vomit Monday morning was enough. Feeling afraid of losing my job was enough. My SO's face when he got ready for work that morning, avoiding eye contact and conversation with me was enough. But I guess if I'm being real with myself, I'm thankful for it all. I need these reminders to kick me in the head. I didn't need to relapse. And I do get the chance to prove to myself I can do better this time. I'm just ready to be free of this horrible withdrawal. This state of being has already stolen way too much of my time. \n",

   "selftext": "Hi everyone- my fianc\u00e9 was a self proclaimed porn addict.  He told me about his issue when we first started dating when he was having problems when we were intimidate.  It took a lot of effort, but he allegedly worked through it at that time (over the course of 1-1.5 years). That was over three years ago and without going into details, I am 100% certain he had turned back to porn.  We have had some stressful times over the last year and I\u2019m sure this has been a contributing factor.\n\nI\u2019ve tried approaching him on several occasions with a sincere heart asking if the addiction has reemerged and he just becomes enraged.  He says he is no longer watching porn, but even if he is, that it is his decision.   He says it is possible for someone with an addiction to do these things in moderation.  I have never heard of an alcoholic being able to drink in moderation, so I have to assume a porn addiction is like any other addiction.  He says that as long as it is not affecting the relationship it is okay, but frankly having sex once a week and sometimes less is a problem for me, so I think the porn consumption does negatively affect the relationship.  And him continuing to lie about it really negatively affects the relationship.  \n\nFrom guys who have been through this addiction,  how would you recommend I handle it/ help to support him when he is lying to me and ultimately himself?  Thanks everyone and best of luck to you!",

   "selftext": "About 4 months ago my SO of 7 years and friend of 13 had, had enough of my bullshit and proceeded to leave me over the phone the following day after some terrible shit I had done; I wondered the streets drunkenly in subzero temp and nearly ended up freezing to death. It's also safe to say I was an alcoholic. After some very horrible weeks I wanted to get professional help because I felt as though I would kill myself and I just couldn't handle losing the most important person in my life.  I'd been diagnosed with BPD approximately a months later with her there with me, we had the overwhelming hit of, \"this explains so much\".  At the time she had still been trying to be supportive and there for me but, after a little while that changed. She eventually said it was too much and that it was far too conflicting for her to be around me and wanted time to heal. Although I'd struggled with the notion of loss of contact with her, I knew how much this illness had hurt and affected her so bad, that I wanted to do it for her. I really loved her and she was in every way my best friend. Several months had gone by and it wasn't easy for me, but I was making centimeters of progress. I wanted to get better. She'd been growing angry in the time we were separate and said we could be friends once I'd gotten better. Then one day she had entirely ghosted me off of every social media platform we shared. I never contacted her the whole time she'd asked me and I've been confused and hurt ever since. She had seen me at my buddy's birthday party and completely cold shouldered me. It's been in the back burner and I breakdown everyday because of it. She knows how much those actions would destroy me and what could happen afterwards. Sadly, I completely understand why. I've been sober for several weeks now and I've come to the cold realization that most people who end up with people diagnosed with BPD do, you can't be with them. I know that my love for her is real and I miss her so much, but I know she can't believe a word I say and even if I talk to her she would dismiss it as me trying to manipulate her. It's pathetic that it could be another shitty part of this mental illness but I sincerely can't deal with it. If the person who was going to be with me for the rest of my life, said they cared about me so much right up until the last time we spoke and was my best friend that I could confide everything in, now wants nothing to do with me, what hope do I have? I don't blame her for wanting to distance herself from me, why believe a monster? I despise this horrid illness and I'm so tired of chipping away at a mountain of misery. Even now I'm aware that I'm looking at this black &amp; white and I can't stand it! Sorry for the really long post but I just don't know what to do.\n\nTL;DR \\- Best friend/exSO hates me because of BPD symptoms she dealt with for 7 years, you can't love people with BPD and will she ever care again.

Why am I doing this to myself?' And then I remember why. I don't want to be an alcoholic for the rest of my life. I don't want to die. I just want the anxiety to go away. \n\nI used to drink at night more than I drank in the day. In the day, I had a glass here and there and I kept a small bottle in my handbag. At night, though, I drank and drank and drank until I blacked out. It was a way for me to escape. I didn't have to face myself. I didn't have to think. Thinking? Didn't exist for me the way it exists for everybody else. My thoughts were 'when can I get blind drunk?' 'Will these 4 bottles last me tonight?' 'I don't have a problem.

   "selftext": "This is not new information. Both her and my father quit drinking shortly after my youngest sibling was born about 24 years ago. About a year ago, my father was able to finally able to retire and in his retirement decided that a drink here and there wasn't a big deal, and to him, it wasn't. However my mother also got in on the fun. That started off fine at first. A drink with dinner here, a nightcap there. Then, unbeknownst to the rest of the family it got worse. \n\nMuch worse.\n\nShe began having a drink every day. Not always with my father. Then twice a day. Then more. Hiding alcohol. Sneaking shots in the bathroom. You know. Alcoholic shit.\n\nMy mother also has depression and is on medication for it. THESE THINGS DO NOT MIX WELL.\n\nAbout 6 weeks ago, my pregnant wife and I went over to my parents house for Saturday dinner, as per usual. When we arrived my mother was on the floor of the kitchen uncontrollably sobbing. My father, standing awkwardly next to her, one hand on her shoulder. He does not do comforting well.\n\nAt this point none of us know about the drinking. We believe this episode to be an adverse effect of her new depression medication. \n\nIt was not. About an hour later when I get her to stop apologizing for \"being stupid\" and \"a bad mother\" she reveals that she had been drinking and was currently very drunk. \n\nShe tells me that she just wants to drink herself to death.\n\nAt this point I just want to get her to bed so she can sober up and, after another very stressful hour or so, we succeed. I tell my father that he can not drink around her anymore and that she needs to get therapy. Right stat now.\n\nI then go about my life, because I do not live at home, have a full time job, my own life and bills to pay and a child on the way, I cannot also be a shrink.\n\nThings return to some level of normalcy, and, to my great shame, I do not follow up with either of my parents on the therapy. I do not think she has seen a therapist yet or even looked for one.\n\nToday I get a text from my father.\n\nHey buddy. Bad news. Your mom just came of shit faced. Call me when you can please.\n\nI am at work god dammit.\n\nI wait the half hour to finish my day and then call him.\n\nApparently my mother went to work this morning for about 20 minutes, made some excuse to leave, went to the liquor store for a bottle of the good stuff and sat in a park for 6 hours putting it down. We found out because a teacher friend of the family had to bring my niece home from school and we she got home, found my mother in the driveway, passed out in the car.They got her in the house and to my knowledge she is now in bed. \n\nMy father and I believe she needs to go to rehab of some kind and he has good health insurance from his old job that we believe will cover it. At least most of it.\n\nSo. My question is, what do I do? What can I do? Did I just need to vent and this helped a bit by itself? How do I not be furious and feel betrayed all the time that now that my life is barely together I have to be her parent as well?",

I made my lawyer make the return of my full bar (with the wine, probably a few grand worth of  booze) a condition of the divorce, though for some reason he seemed to think injecting \"I NEED MY BOOZE BACK\" into my divorce proceedings was a bad idea. Weird.  Although I've cut back substantially lately (handle every other day or less to handle and change a week) tonight I've reached an impasse. \n\nMy most recent handle (Seagrams) died an untimely death. I've been drinking enough that I shouldn't drive to the liquor store to buy more and I don't really feel like berating some uber driver into delivering booze.\n\nThen I remembered. Gaga's bar! My great-grandmother died 20 odd years ago in her 90s. Her husband, my alcoholic great grandfather, died decades before. Through a variety of subsequent deaths, my particular branch of the family ended up with most of the stuff. Including the sole inheritance I claimed- their bar. \n\nThe bar, which is a pretty cool piece of antique furniture (think Mad Men office bar), is fully stocked. Whiskey (Scotch, bourbon, rye), gin, vodka, tequila, rum, bitters, liqueurs, etc. Everything you'd need to make most cocktails. My Aunt used to tell me how her grandfather taught her to make old fashioneds for him when she was five at it (parenting goals!).\n\nThere's just one problem. My great-grandfather, who bought all of this booze, died more than 40 years ago. He bought all of this booze, because my great-grandmother didn't drink. I just checked the only unopened bottle and it's from 1962. Older than me. Not a single one of these bottles has a label on it that I've seen in stores in my lifetime.  I'd guess none is younger than 50. These are actually kind of a fun conversation piece usually. \n\nI've got playoff basketball to watch tonight CA, and I need to drink.

   "selftext": "I share my story in the hopes it will give someone the hope and strength they need to have the same experience I had to recover from alcoholism.  \nI was a nervous kid with lots of anxieties and adhd. I was off the walls and my head would never stop talking to me, I always seemed to overthink stuff. I never really felt like I was part of the group, like I was always on the outside looking in, even though I had friends.  I was never comfortable in my own skin. When I found booze I knew I found what was missing, looking back I was instantly addicted. I loved it, it made me feel like I could be the person I thought I wanted to be. I turned my life over to booze at the age of 13. Everything came second to booze. I chose a career where I could drink everyday working night shift as a waiter in restaurants. I had a shit tonne of fun and I was right in the middle of the action, I had arrived, I felt not only a part of, but almost like a leader of the party crew we had. Little did I know alcohol is a progressive disease and always gets worse, never better. My grandpa always said do something you love for a career, well I loved booze so I became a bartender... Lol.. (probably not what he meant) I ended up getting into cocaine which led me to my first treatment center. Funny thing is I wanted to quit coke so I could keep drinking, I never wanted to quit drinking, how could I ever have fun again without booze, life would be boring and mundane.... Shit was I wrong. Left that treatment center to drink the first night out. Then I moved towns and cocaine wasn't easy to find. I would come home after work and drink a 26er (750ml) of vodka by myself, pass out and wake up and puke a little bit..... Amazingly I actually thought I was doing good because I wasn't doing coke. My alcoholism progressed and I discovered the morning drink which was the death of me. I would drink the morning drink, trigger my allergy and keep drinking. In the end, after 20 yrs of hardcore drinking I had progressed to drinking around the clock, 4 or 5 day blackouts and I kept ending up on the hospital for medical detox as I was scared I would get seizures and die... It happens!.. Another treatment center only to drink the first day I got out again. In and out of AA for years, coming back over 30 times!... I was a hopeless alcoholic. I did want to drink but I couldn't imagine a life without it. How would I have the confidence to pick up women? To hang out with friends and be funny and the life of the party? How would I live life? I always had alcohol as a crutch to get me through the hard stuff in life.... Finally my family didn't want to talk to me anymore, not cus I was a bad drunk but they just couldn't stand by and watch me die, or come get their baby from the hospital shaking and on deaths door.... Again and again..... Finally my last drunk was a 4 day blackout, I knew I was going to die a lonely painful alcoholic death. I know to the core of my being that no matter what I do, I can not stop myself from picking up that first drink! I stood at the turning point, I was either going to commit suicide or completely turn my life over to a God I don't even think exists. I said to myself well if there is a God, I'm going to find out.... I got on my knees and I prayed, not like before but I honestly meant it and was willing to believe (there's no atheists when the plane is going down) I prayed to \"God\" and said I don't care what you would have me be, I completely give myself to you. You can have all of me and I meant it. I felt a weird feeling, like a 100 pound weight was taken from my shoulders. I was sick of following all the opinions and advice in AA, there is so much conflicting advice it's brutal. I said this time, I am doing it exactly how the first 100 men and women did it, if it isn't in the big book, I'm not doing it, nothing more, nothing less. It really worked back then, not now with all the treatment center bullshit. I studied that book like my life depended on it. I got a sponsor, I made a daily plan. Wake up, pray, make bed, red daily reflections, go to moon meeting, go to gym, read big nook, then night meeting, pray and go to bed. I did a meeting or 2 a day for the first year. I did my steps in the first 3 weeks, which is exactly how they are supposed to be done. I did them right out of the big book with the help of the Joe and Charlie speaker tapes... They are so amazing. They explain the book better than I've ever heard, I finally understood what to do... Today I am 9 yrs sober and I still call Joe and Charlie my program sponsors. I completely gave myself to AA even though I didn't believe in God and I hated AA and all those \"religious people\" and lame losers.... I found an amazing life. I made friends. I got involved with young people groups and we would go to dances and roundups, and bowling and kareoke and camping etc etc, I was the life of the sober party! I felt comfortable in my own skin! With the help of AA and \"God\" I walked through all those fears and lived life on life's terms and I thrived! ...... I started sponsoring people and they started getting sober. I ran Joe and Charlie step groups and helped others through the steps. I had a home group that I contributed to and ran the newcomers meeting for them before the main meeting. Today my life is honestly beyond my wildest dreams. When I sobered up I just wanted a little apartment and that would be great. I went back to school multiple times for different things, I learned how to be a mechanic and fix up jetskis and motorbikes, something I always wanted. I worked on boats and got other professional designations through school. I got jobs in top management for hospitality. Today I run my own successful business. I am happily married and have a dog and young daughter that makes me happier than I ever imagined I could be. I have a bunch of jetskis, boat, motorbike, etc. I own my own house on a large property. My life is amazing and I owe it all to AA...... If it weren't for AA I would be dead. I was a hopeless alcohol doomed to an alcoholic death but I was plucked from my own insanity by a power greater than me and have recovered from that seemingly hopeless state of mind and body.......i truly hope you all find your way. When. I tried to sober up without AA, sobriety was always something to endure, or fight through, and was very painful, with AA it made it so sobriety was something to be celebrated and enjoyed...  Here's a link to those tapes, pm me you email address if you want the sheets they talk about..... \nhttp://silkworth.net/pages/freestuff.php",

I have realized lately that I just replaced alcohol with weed (though I was doing it before I stopped drinking). \n\nFor a long time it was the only thing that helped me sleep without crazy side effects the next day. Now, it doesn\u2019t help me sleep like it used to, and I have to do more because of my tolerance level going up. I feel so cloudy headed all the time, I haven\u2019t felt clear headed in a couple years.

Just for clarification, I don\u2019t try to apply anywhere while high, but I seem to be cloudy now even when I\u2019m not actively stoned. \n\nToday, I decided enough was enough and I threw away my stash. I am really happy I did that, but I\u2019m pretty scared. I know I\u2019ll be okay, but it\u2019s been a little while since I\u2019ve been completely sober, which means I have to feel the bad feelings now. I have to live instead of accepting mediocrity because I\u2019m buzzing. \n\nPart of the reason I\u2019m anxious is that people are very dismissive of weed. In fact, when I\u2019ve told some people that I wanted to stop, they get confused. I think they think I\u2019m overreacting and being dramatic. I know I\u2019m psychologically dependent on it right now though and I\u2019m not happy. Spending a lot of days crying, and I never feel very good physically. Has anyone else run into this dismissiveness? How do you handle it? \n\nThanks for reading. I\u2019m really glad there are people out there that also want to stop. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit: I do have depression, and I\u2019m on medication for it.

I'm afraid this post isn't as positive as I'd like it to be. I don't want to give up \\- I committed to, at the very least, 30 days \\- but I'm not sure where I go from there once I get to that point. But first I have to GET to that point. If I can't do what I said I would do, then I have no business even THINKING about moderating. I know, I know. I KNOW. I'm pissed at myself for even thinking about it. But that's the thing. I need to make this post, I need to share this struggle. I could shame myself for wanting to try moderating but that ain't gonna stop my stupid mind from trying to entertain the idea, so I need to acknowledge my thoughts and deal with them one way or another.\n\nFor those of you only a few weeks in and feeling great, GOOD for you. I am so happy for you, and I don't want to diminish that at all \\- I am just being honest when I say, that has not been the case for me. I don't feel great. The positive posts encouraged me, but now, for MY OWN personal experience, I feel like I got my hopes up too much seeing all the positivity in this sub. Not to make excuses. I should have known this wouldn't be easy. I mean \\- I DID know. I just didn't think it'd be this damn hard, either.\n\nThe first few days were hard, then they got easier. The irritability I had last time was mild \\- until about a week ago. I had prepared myself for it to be bad the first two weeks like before, only to have things be just fine the first two weeks, and then feel absolutely full of rage and irritation and... emptiness. \n\nI didn't think I had a pink cloud at all until now, looking back and realizing how decent and hopeful I felt around day 6\\-7 through about day 11. Then I just... crashed. And ever since then, I've been feeling myself just getting emotionally weaker.\n\nThis is longer than I've gone in at least three years. Twenty\\-one days is HUGE for me. And I keep telling myself all the reasons. Weight loss. Not chugging water. No more shameful liquor store stops. More money in the wallet. More focus. More self\\-confidence. Feeling emotions normally again. Better personal hygiene. No puffy red face. So on. Because the self that decided to go for 30 days knows all these things. I have to do it for me.\n\nBut I ALSO knew I couldn't do it if I said I was going to stop drinking \"forever.\" So I set a smaller goal instead, but one that, judging by so many of the positive posts here, I thought would be long enough to show me that sobriety was better. That I wouldn't want to go back to drinking \\- at least not quite this bad.\n\nSaying \"30 days\" \\(or x number of days\\) was the only way this was ever going to work. If I say \"just today,\" then I manage today but drink again tomorrow. For me, \"just one day\" means one day. Repeating that day after day just doesn't seem to stick. I needed to commit to something longer. But now I feel like saying I'd do 30 days before is what's fucking me now. Now, because I said 30 days, my stupid mind is already planning to drink after it's been 30 days. \n\nBecause if I can do 30 days, I can do 6 days for the rest of my life, right? Only drink on Saturdays? Nah, I don't want to only drink 1 or 2 a night, it's not worth it. I want to drink 7 or 10 on a Saturday night. A little soft\\-reset in between work weeks just to get some goddamn RELIEF from this constant tension, anger, and emptiness.\n\nI know. It's only for a couple hours, then it just turns into tiredness and passing out. But I'm not gonna sit here and pretend drinking never did anything for me. If that was true, I wouldn't have done it so much. It DID help me relax. It let me put the stress on pause for a little bit so that the next day. Lower my stress capacity enough so that I don't feel like I'm going to overflow the next day. Yes, I self\\-medicated.\n\nAnd between the day I first had a problem with alcohol \\(which was not the first time I drank, just the first time I understood what everyone was talking about, \"everyone\" being people who like alcohol a little too much, \"everyone\" being partiers and binge\\-drinkers and alcoholics\\)... between then and now, WHILE I was drinking, I got and held down a good full\\-time job, thrived at said job \\(my boss loves me\\), moved out of my parents' place and into an apartment, moved again into a different apartment this time on my own, got a dog, wrote the first and second drafts of three \\(3\\) novels in a series each of which are between 100k\\-150k words... I DID STUFF. I was productive, and fuck me, but I truly believe that part of it was because I was \"coping\" with alcohol.\n\nI'm not saying that it was a healthy coping mechanism. But it WAS a coping mechanism, nonetheless, and it did for me what coping mechanisms tend to do and helped me cope.\n\nI've been doing what I can to form my own coping mechanisms. Got a gym membership. Spend more time in the sun outside. Writing at coffee shops. Staying out of my apartment. Today I visited my parents. I've been doing my best, but if \"normal\" coping isn't going to help soon, I don't know how long I can keep this up.\n\nHaving said all that about the good that happened while I was drinking \\(not because of it \\- most likely just in spite of it, but still\\)... For my own sake, and for the sake of anyone else reading who's struggling, I would love to be able to say I have another, longer list of the BAD things that happened during my years of drinking. If you don't count things that don't actually affect my productivity and overall quality of life \\(such as mildly\\-inconvenient stops at the liquor store and overall less cash that doesn't really put me in any financial danger\\), it all comes down to one thing: health. In 6 years I've gained over 70 lbs, from drinking and from binge\\-eating WHILE drinking. I worry about my health, my low energy due to the weight gain and drinking, and obviously the state of my liver because that thing takes the brunt of alcohol abuse, don't it?\n\nThat said, if I got tests run and found out my liver was perfectly normal, and if I was able to stop binge\\-eating while binge\\-drinking, and exercise and lose weight \\(or at least not gain any more\\), I don't know for sure if I'd really want to have stopped drinking. I TELL myself that there are all kinds of good reasons to stop, but outside of the weight gain, are there really? Is my life really a net loss since I started drinking? I have a good job, my own place, dog, I still write and do things that are fulfilling to me. So why I can't I have Saturdays? Why did I have to be an alcoholic? Can I control this disease and still drink once a week? It's not fair that other people get to have a nice buzz and relax and I can't do it without getting addicted and gaining 70 pounds?\n\nI know the novels, the successful job, the place to live, etc. didn't happen because I was drinking. But drinking didn't keep me from doing those things either. It didn't ruin my life. It didn't ruin much at all.\n\nI don't know what I'm asking, here. Please don't do the \"Do you want to quit or not\" or the \"Are you an alcoholic\" or any other smart questions that are supposed to make a point. Believe me, I'm already asking myself all of them, and self isn't listening. I don't know how to move forward. I know I'll make 30 days but frankly, I can't wait until those 30 days are over. And nobody in my life is saying how much better I seem. Certainly not me \\(because I don't seem better, and I don't feel better\\), and not my family, and not anyone at work either. \n\nNobody is saying how I \"look so good lately, are you losing weight?\" and I don't \"seem happier\" and I certainly don't \"glow.\"\n\nUgh, sorry for this. I feel like there's more I have to say, and I really wanted to end this on a hopeful note, but I don't think I can right now. At least I have 10 days I've still committed to sobriety to figure this out. There's a part of me still hoping I'll find a way to maintain abstinence beyond this, or, if it's possible, very strict 2\\-4 days per month moderation policy. I say this fully knowing how that turns out for most people, but maybe I need to understand for myself. Maybe I need to learn the hard way. Or maybe this is the lizard brain trying to justify the inevitable relapse.\n\nThis is it, isn't it? I've seen folks say the relapse starts long before you actually drink. Am I already in the beginning stage of relapse? Is it too late to turn it around? Do I even want to turn it around? I don't know what to think right now.\n\nI do know this much: I will not drink with you today. If nothing else... if nothing else at all comes of this post... I will not drink with you today.",

On the ride over my partner said, \"rain and snow never stopped me from getting a drink, why should this stop me from going to a meeting?\"  He was relating his reply to his wife who had suggested he stay home.  And this time of year it didn't get dark until the trip home, but I always wanted to start a piece of writing with that cliche. *Bucket list checked off*.\n\nLast week we had not finished with step five, so we jumped back in about half way through.  The way this meeting works is that if at some point in the reading something strikes someone, they wait for the paragraph to end and then knock on the desk \\(it's a GED classroom by day\\) and speak on how it relates to them.   Sometimes we will go on a ride where one share spurs another and it's a while before we get back to the reading.  That happened last week, but there's no rush...\n\npreachybit/ the thing about step 5 is that it can bring us out of our isolation \\- we can let the secrets that kept us trapped in a spiral of self loathing go and begin the process of breaking out of that self fulfilling spiral of shame that gave us reasons to drink.  **In many ways just saying, \"my name is slipacre and I am an alcoholic\" is a 5th step** \\(miniaturized and in need of fleshing out sooner or later\\)  but it does shine light into what is/was a pretty dark closet for a lot of us./preachybit\n\nA fifth step meeting sometimes brings out details \\- one man was saying how he looked forward to this meeting because he could 'spill his guts', and then he said, \"I know something about that, one time I was in a fight and the other guy had this really sharp knife and he sliced my belly open and I was standing there holding my intestines in.\"  He paused, \"I'm lucky to be alive. And to have found this place.\" He meant AA not prison, but he has said in the past that if he hadn't been arrested and he'd kept doing what he was doing, he would not be alive.\n\npreachybit2/**for all you binge drinkers out there \\-** this is the kind of thing that can happen in an instant \\- he certainly did not see this coming \\- there was no time to react, to think, to reason.  Alcohol was involved, massive amounts, and it took him to the corner of Wrong Place and Wrong Time.  For whatever reason binge drinkers tend to go there too often. /preachybit2\n\nAfter his share we went back to the reading \\- towards the end of the step it says \" The  dammed\\-up  emotions  of   years  break out of  their confinement, and miraculously vanish as soon as they are exposed. As the pain subsides, a healing tranquillity takes its place.\"  **My secrets kept me in a prison just as nasty as the one I visited last night, my guilt and shame were sadistic guards that kept me chained to the bottle, in solitary.**  Today I am free, on a lifetime parole perhaps, but free and it all started by saying \"I am an alcoholic.\" letting go of the debate as to whether I was a level 2 'problem drinker, or whatever \\- I  drank too much, it got me in trouble, brought me shame and it had to stop.  Admitting  it was the key to doing something about it.\n\nThe ride home furthered lucky to be alive, the suicidal deer were elsewhere last night passing up patches of fog and low visibility from which they could have blindsided us. \\(and I drove with extra caution\\)  Just another thing to have gratitude for.\n\npreachybit3/right about now the members of this group are waking up, in prison.  If you are reading this, you likely are not. **Put that on your gratitude list**.

She\u2019s divorced from my father n law and he\u2019s remarried, her family lives across the country, so taking care of her falls on her children. My wife and brother n law always fill this role, but my wife works full-time and my brother n laws wife is \u201cforbidding\u201d him from seeing his mom because she\u2019s a crazy cunt. So seeing as nobody else is available I\u2019m filling the role for the time being. Unlike my brother n laws wife I believe you should love family unconditionally. This woman gave birth to my wife, who provided me with 2 wonderful children so I feel morally obligated to help her. She\u2019s a great person sober and I love her very much. \n\nAll that being said I am new to this situation and wanted some advice on how to handle this. My wife pretty much just checks in on her, makes sure she\u2019s alive, and tries to make her drink some water. I\u2019ve been doing that plus making her small things to eat. I also took her car battery out last night because she has a ton of spare keys (wife takes her keys when she drinks so she has spares hidden everywhere). I know she\u2019ll get an Uber to the liquor store, but at least this way she\u2019s off the road. She does have major withdraw symptoms though, and she\u2019s had seizures after a binge in the past. This kind of worries me because she can\u2019t afford to pay someone to watch over her, and I certainly don\u2019t have time to do that between school and kids. I know she tends to buy wine coolers to help wean off but is that really safe? I\u2019m so lost here...

But then came the horrors of blackouts, hangovers, embarrassing behavior, and general life malaise.\n\nIt was a lose-lose. So that's why I'm here with all of you! Couldn't be happier about it.",

   "selftext": "Thought for the Day\n\n\nA lot of well meaning people treat an alcoholic like the priest and the Levite. They pass by on the other side by scorning him and telling him what a low person he is, with no willpower. Whereas, he really has fallen for alcohol, in the same way as the man in the story fell among robbers. And the member of A.A. who is working with others is like the Good Samaritan. Am I moved with compassion? Do I take care of another alcoholic whenever I can?\n\nMeditation for the Day\n\n\nI must constantly live in preparation for something better to come. All of life is a preparation for some thing better. I must anticipate the morning to come. I must feel, in the night of sorrow, that understanding joy that tells of confident expectation of better things to come. \"Sorrow may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" Know that God has something better in store for you, as long as you are making yourself ready for it. All your existence in this world is a training for a better life to come.\n\nPrayer for the Day\n\n\nI pray that when life is over, I will return to an eternal, spaceless life with God. I pray that I may make this life a preparation for a better life to come.",

Next thing I recall was leaving a liquor store sometime in the evening. Thing is I don't drink, anymore (not an alcoholic or anything, just a social drinker who no longer has friends). This last week has been a blur. I've had quite bad headaches that feel like my head is going to explode, vision in my left eye is mostly blurry with some brief moments of \"clearer\" vision, and by that I mean it's not quite as blurry but vision in that eyr looks like a fun house mirror. Ive been pretty nauseous this last week, throwing up here and there. I've uncharacteristically (I'd like to think lol) been a bit of a dick the lest few days from  a couple of texts I've received in response to texts I dint remember sending. Pressure headaches that feel worse today than yesterday . Don't think I've been sleeping well but I do know that I'm really tured all the time. I taped a piece of gause over my left eye and that seems to help a bit with my balance. Sorry for any formatting or grammar mistakes and lack of direction of my post, I've been typing this up for a good two hours or so trying toconcentrate and  think of all the things that haven't been nkrmal this week.

   "selftext": "It's been pretty stressful lately. I'm super busy, working full-time and going to school. Plus, my school and work are tied in together, so if I think about skipping a day of school, they'll find out at work and I'll get in trouble. This means that work dictates approximately 100% of my life during the work week. I have to get up for school, then have a 2-hour break between them, barely enough time to drive home, kick my shoes off, sit for a moment before putting shoes back on and driving to work. When I get home, I have to go straight to bed to do it all over again. This has led to some weird reckless behavior in rebellion of this. Right now, I'm fighting the temptation to drive 20 minutes to buy a new video game and hit up a drive-thru before going into work.\n\nPlus, a few more of my classmates just got fired last week. We started with 16 people last year, now we're down to 7. One of the last people to get fired came to work smelling of whiskey and tested for narcotics. I've tried to let my classmates know that I'm a recovering alcoholic and they can come to me for help, but it seems like everyone says they're doing fine right up until they get fired. This all puts a little bit more stress in our already stretched out systems. I find myself thinking about drinking and smoking weed now more than ever before since I quit.\n\nBut in spite of all this, I am doing well. Here's a few vital statistics on my life:\n\n* Currently 7 1/2 years sober\n\n* Happily married to a woman who understands my sobriety and supports me fully\n\n* Almost at the halfway point of my 2-year degree with a 4.0 GPA\n\n* Have a rock solid reputation at my job, considered one of the best people in our class of interns\n\n* Making more money than I ever have in my life\n\n* Keeping up on housework and chores on my days off\n\n* Able to have guilt-free splurges like a new Lego model even though I'm 35 years old\n\n* Once I get this degree, I'll be hired on fully at work and if all goes well, I'll be set for life with a job that pays well and even has a pension\n\nIt's been a couple of stressful weeks with everything going on, and it's still going to be rather stressful for a while. I just needed to stop and take a moment to relax and acknowledge all the things that I'm doing well. I absolutely would not have made it this far if I was still drinking, and I know that I can stay sober and graduate.\n\nThanks for listening. I'd love to hear about your successes too. No matter how small, it helps to take a moment and track just how well we are doing in life. IWNDWYT",

I eventually turned into the guy that always blacked out and eventually became very aggressive. I never went to jail or got a dui or lost my job because of my drinking. I thought I was good at being a professional alcoholic. Then my mom suddenly is in the hospital. She doesn't make it and dies in hospice care at age 53. My drinking turned very dark. You could almost say I was playing chicken with a higher power. I always had a sharp tongue and could be flirtatious with women. That eventually lead to an ultimatum, get sober or lose you family. I checked myself into rehab but quickly left to do outpatient rehab because I wasn't in trouble with the law like almost all the kids I was there with and  I do mean kids. These young men and women were almost all full blown heroin addicts. It still shocking to think about what we have done to the generation after mine. Anyway a few weeks of outpatient and I was ready to get back to my life and my job. 2 years later almost to the day and I'm struggling. I've had this feeling before but not this overpowering. I feel like I've falling behind so much in life I'll never catch up. I'm a veteran I served from 2000 to 2005. I was 22 when I got out and enrolled in college full time. Back then the VA was a mess. I went a whole semester without a check. I had bills to pay and I had a family to take care of. I quit and I got a job that I've been at ever since. I drank away 12 years of my life and at 35 I feel like everything I've done has left me looking like a failure. You see you don't have to lose ANYTHING to still fuck up your life with booze. I want to go back to school but I don't know where to start or even if that will really help me. 2 years sober and I've  never been this lost. Sorry hopefully I'm better tomorrow. IWNDWYT ",

I always get back up but there comes a point where I am sick and tired of falling into the same trap over and over again.

   "selftext": "TL;DR: I'm just a guy who wants change, and will get it; not for myself (because I'm honestly not that great), but for those who truly deserve it. \n\nI'm 29, I've got two daughters who have done more for me than they will ever know, and I am completely lost in life, and struggling daily to keep me head above the water which is depression, trying to suck me down.\n\nI was raised by the most amazing woman who shielded me from my alcoholic, drug addict, dad. I was brought up having to put on a tough, nothing ever gets to me, face to protect her. That's plagued me into adulthood since I've never been comfortable talking about myself or my feeling.\n\nMy personal communication skills being absolutely nil, and the only relationships I knew were two people scrambling to cover up the truth, I slowly decayed my marriage to my high school sweet heart. Breaking her heart, and destroying myself in the process. Since then I've had few, brief, episodes of happiness or contentment since then, but more often than not I'm struggling to keep my head above water, while showing a happy smiling face to the world.\n\nI have, and continue to with some, struggled with alcohol, relationships, school, my career, and more than anything myself. I am finally realizing the damage inadvertently done to me, and I had done to myself, as an adolescent. I am learning who I am, what I care about, and what I want, at nearly the age of thirty. \n\nI struggle daily with depression, anxiety, inferiority, and my own stupid pride. But I've finally realized (against said pride) that I cannot do this on my own. I was able to get out of bed, see my doctor and behavioral health... I have medication now and an appointment with a therapist. I've started reading probably the most relatable and insightful book, which I'm lucky to have stumbled upon, and I may possibly see light at the end of this tunnel. \n\nIt's not that my depression is so intolerable, it's looking back on how terrible it has been, and seeing the intolerable path of the future without change. I do not feel different, I still, just last night, went over messages from the worst night of my life (Halloween, 5 years ago) again and again and cried my eyes out. I still listened to music that is horrible for me, and I still struggled to get out of bed this morning. What I have decided is to say f*** my feelings. I owe it to my children, my mother who tried so hard to protect me, and the friends I've slowly lost as I've sunk farther and farther, to get out there and change myself \n\nI will tear down this demon that has worked so hard to replace me. Rip up the vine and take root. I will not let myself succumb to this and die. Moving forward as the shell, the embodiment of depression made manifest. \n\nThis scares the ever loving sh*t out of me. But that's alright, that's just a feeling and I've decided to give a giant middle finger to my feelings, so I'll move forward regardless. The worst that could happen is nothing, which is my life right now, so I've truly got nothing to lose. \n",

I\u2019ve not reset it as I didn\u2019t want to get the \u2018fuckit ive already failed\u2019 mindset when actually, yes I drank at a work night out but I then woke up, noted how it made me feel and carried on with my sobriety - Im proud of my sober time and I don\u2019t want to see it as ruined when I still have it.\n\nI\u2019m having a really shit day this is going to be a mixed up post.\n\nMy alcoholic (in denial) mum was meant to come stay at mine. We haven\u2019t really spoken since the end of jan - she\u2019s been drunk every time I call but she\u2019s been getting bad back ache and asked me if she could come to stay.  I have a sober policy here and because I suspect her back pain is alcohol related I thought time away from the bottle would maybe get her back on track?  There was a time around Christmas where when I called she would be sober and present 90% of the time,  it was amazing to have my mum back.\n\nI always get anxiety in the lead up to her coming, sometimes she lets me down. The time she was due to stay prior to Christmas she got plastered and somehow knocked her tooth out and woke up on the floor of her home the morning of the flight and of course didn\u2019t set off.  I knew something was up when I couldn\u2019t get through to her on the phone all day yesterday, sure enough when she finally picked up at about 9pm she could barely speak just made noises.  I was stupidly still hopeful she would sleep it off and come then received a call from her at 6am..she still sounded drunk but like someone who\u2019s had a skin full and woken up still drunk..she said she was up to get ready and still coming and would see me in the afternoon (she was getting a lift to airport as she lives abroad).\n\nMy partner went to get her from the airport as planned but she didn\u2019t get off the flight, he called me in a meeting to let me know.  I tried her home phone umpteen times (her mobile was off) I facebook messaged the guy she is seeing that took her there - nothing.  I checked her flight details (my login), it said she checked in..I was then in panic mode.  My partner waited about 40 mins after landing and left.  I text him to ask if he\u2019d look out for her whilst he was driving out in case she was there. Once I was out my meeting 10 mins later I called him and asked if he\u2019d seen her - he blew up at me  \u2018You what? No I\u2019m on my way home\u2019 \n\nI tried the airport who couldn\u2019t tell me anything then manically called her house over and over and over by this time it\u2019s like 3pm her flight got in at 1:45 and I\u2019m so worried - the guy she sees  answered and said she was turned away from the flight.\n\nI feel so hurt and let down but also stupid because what did I expect. My partner is ignoring me upstairs saying I asked him if he saw her with a tone, I tried to call him a few times on my way home to sort it but he ignored my calls.  Since I drank on Friday, although he didn\u2019t see me drunk and I came home at the time I said and slept in the spare room, he\u2019s spoken to me and treated me like absolute shit.  I\u2019m losing my rag - i work so hard, support him constantly with work and home stuff, do all the things around the house (diy garden washing tidying things away make beds etc etc) and I feel like I get fuck all in return.  Where\u2019s my support?  Why is even this about him? The other day whilst saying our relationship was shit cause I don\u2019t do anything for him (!) he threw it in my face that he got us a cleaner like that\u2019s how he supports me but he got a cleaner one day a week because he refused to lift a finger and I was getting so angry at working long hrs all week then spending all weekend each week cleaning the house after us both!The cleaner was the compromise!!\n\nWe are engaged and right now I feel so unsupported I\u2019m really not sure if we should even be together after this week.  I try so hard with sobriety, helping him with his work, cooking, I deal with all the bills and household stuff, I work hard all week , I literally put so much effort into placating him and into making myself a better version constantly and I feel that all he does is knock me down for it and tries to monopolise my time.  He is only happy if I am sat next to him watching tv, if I do anything else I\u2019m being neglectful.  The other day he had a strop because I wouldn\u2019t get his painkillers for him from the room next to ours when we were both in bed - he lay in pain all night to prove a point and I let him because he can\u2019t keep treating me like a second rate citizen and expect me to run around after him.  I feel like I have a sponging  teenager. I feel like I give and give and he just keeps taking.  I don\u2019t even think he\u2019d really care if I drank if I didn\u2019t speak and just sat next to him all the fucking live long day watching tv.  I\u2019m so fed up today.\n\n\nBut I won\u2019t and am not interested in drinking.\n",

   "selftext": "First of all, I would like to say that I tried (and probably failed) to make this sound like as little of a sob story as I could. I accept my life the way it is and I accept that I am the reason of my own unhappiness.\nAnyways, today I was skypeing with my mom and she very casually told me that my biological father has died. I'm not saying a father or a dad because he was never one to me. He abandoned me and my mom when I was about two years old and has never again bothered to see me, spend time with me or acknowledge my existence. I was raised by my mom and maternal grandparents; my grandfather was (and proudly continues to be) the worst imaginable male role model for a little girl (or any other being under the sun), and out of the very little respect I have for him, I won't say anything else. So, when I found out my biological father had died, I didn't feel sadness, or grief or any of the feelings I imagine people experience at the loss of a parent. Instead, all these questions came to my head: did he think about his daughter in his last minutes? A girl who was the only fatherless child in her grade in primary school and was ashamed to admit it? Did he regret not being there for a little girl who just wanted a father so much? Did he at least wish he could go back and do things differently? Months of being depressed and numb have really left me unable to put a finger on exactly what emotion I'm feeling at finding out he's dead.\nYet, at this point in life, I just can't find it in myself to hate him or to blame him for not being there for me. I don't know much about his relationship with his own father, but his mother (my paternal grandmother) was an abusive alcoholic who died before I was even born of (probably) hepatic cirrhosis, so his adolescent years must have been quite as, um, unexciting, as mine. But couldn't my father have at least tried to be there for his child? Honestly, what's worse than not even trying at all? However, I now find myself wishing he is at peace, in a better place. Whatever that better place might be, since I don't believe in god anymore. \nWeird thing is, I had thoughts about my biological father yesterday. It's just something that pops into mind from time to time, I'm sure people with absent parents can relate. Anyways, my thoughts were pretty much the same as they always are: is there any particular reason my father never wanted me? I wished I could find him, make him realize how depressed I am and shout him in the face \"Look what your absence has contributed to! You being there would have made a fucking difference!\"\nToday, I feel like I'm standing on the edge of the highest cliff in the world, and if I actually was I'd jump without a second thought.\nI really wanted to put this out there, because I have no one to talk to. I have no siblings, no friends, no pets even. I know my mom loves me, hell, she gave up her youth to raise me a respectable, decent, undepressed adult, but she thinks that depression is a choice and that I could just wish it away if I really wanted and be happy. That, of course, means that she doesn't understand me and never will, and I can't talk to her because every time I've mentioned that maybe it would have been better if I had never been born at all, she makes me feel guilty for even harbouring such thoughts.\nThe reason I'm discussing the people I hail from with strangers on the internet, is because I hope that other people might have had similar experiences and would perhaps like to share. I feel that people in this subreddit are probably the only people in the world who could truly understand me.\nI'm gonna end this with a confession: no matter what I've ever said to people who have asked me about it, up until this point in my life there has not been anything I have wanted more than a loving, caring father. A father who would hold my hand and take me for a walk in a park, a father who would hate every boy I dated before meeting them, a father who would show me how to fix my bike and fill the gas tank of my car. If anyone who reads this happens to have a father that even remotely resembles the above description, please tell him you love him today.",

   "selftext": "I (so stupidly) got involved again with my ex 6 months ago, he is the one that I haven't ever been able to shake. We broke up (well, he ghosted me until I finally showed up at his house and he broke up with me THROUGH THE DOOR) because of my BPD. Cue two years of alcoholism and turmoil, finally starting to get over being without him but not over him. It took so much therapy, and I still barely made it out. One night out of the blue he sends me a text and says he needs me, stupid me leaves the next day to attend to him (like I have always done, and mind you he has never ever done for me) and we end up hooking up. After getting back together (secretly, he would never let me tell anyone and refused to let anyone know we were seeing each other again..which was a whole new kind of torment in itself), everything besides that seemed fine. He would talk to me, tell me he missed me, hearted me (refused to say love, but I understood that after our breakup because he said I hurt him so bad), we even exchanged cute Christmas presents and spent every moment we could together before he moved to a city that was 1.5 hours away. It all seemed great, like things were finally getting to the point where I could attempt to make things up to him and show him how much he meant to me. \n\nI violated my probation and had to go to jail for 3 months. He texted me once during the time that I was incarcerated, but the one text he sent consisted of \"I miss you, I had a dream that you were with me and I woke up just wanting to hold you.\" kinds of things. This really gave me hope and I got through being in jail rather well, considering I had confided in him before I went that I felt like me going to jail was going to doom us. \n\nI get out and send him a text and all I get was \"hey what are you doing today?\" and then nothing at all. It's been almost two weeks and I have received no reply and he even blocked me on Steam (gaming app for computer). I found out that during one of our usual festivals we mutually attend that one of my good friends was sitting in his lap a lot, which bothers me because I have had conversations with he about how I feel about him. I can't even ask him about it because at first I thought I was just being jealous and paranoid, but now he won't speak to me. I am off all of my meds and am not seeing a therapist because I have no insurance, so I feel like this is killing me. I want to talk to people about it but the only people who know (roommates and sister) probably won't want to listen because they warned me about this from the start. I know they'll be there for me but I feel ashamed to even talk about it anymore. I did this to myself, I feel so stupid. I knew he was bad for my mental health and I still let him get to me. Now I am left to pick up the pieces with not even a clue of what I did wrong this time. He held me and told me he wasn't going to ghost me again, not unless I did something very bad. To my knowledge I haven't done anything, and believe me I have ran everything through my head over and over again. I feel so broken, and I just want it to stop. Sorry for formatting/the lack of proper grammar in this post, I just had to get it out and I can't stop crying. Thanks for listening, it feels better to at least get some of this out.",

This is still new to me and has only been around for a year. That\u2019s when I cut ties with my dad to let me heal and focus on myself as things got really bad with depression, anxiety attacks I almost became an alcoholic almost walked out in oncoming traffic.  Today I tried reaching out to him again and it was all the same things. Things that most people would be able to brush off but I can\u2019t. My mom left my dad as he was physically abusive to me and my sister and mentally abusive to my mom. I was 6 but took on the role to try and keep the peace and do what I could to protect my mom and let my sister have as much a normal life as she could. My dad had this special way of making my sister and I feel like we were the shityest person in the world over something that was not our fault or didn\u2019t even matter. When we would visit my dad would pass code the phones as my sister would call mom sometimes when she was sacred but would give me the code but tell me that if I were to give it to my sister it would end worse for the both of us. There was a time he picked us up for a weekend but then keep us for his summer two weeks without telling my mom. My sister had No idea and I had to make sure she didn\u2019t know as for her not to get scared but the entire trip I know mom didn\u2019t know where we were or if were safe. This led to me having trust issues and anxiety/panic attacks whenever dad would come to pick me up and because on bad advice that out therapist gave my mom. When he came to pick me up and I didn\u2019t want to go and hid in a closet I could her my mom tell him where I was and then physically remove me from my house while my mom did nothing and that\u2019s when I lost trust in everything. I learned to not feel emotions but be super observant to other people\u2019s emotions. Which is why if someone is having a bad day I start to panic thinking that I did something wrong. I have come such a long way and lost it all a year ago and worked so hard to get to where I am now. But after that call I feel like its slipping away I feel like I am unwanted and that every that is wrong or cold be wrong is all on my shoulders and I just want to crawl up in bed and let the world pass by. I don\u2019t even know if this is the right place to put this but tomorrow will come and I will go through the motions and try to find ways to get through this. If I did it before I can do it again I am just getting so tired.",

I go to my friend's bar and she makes me mocktails all night.\n\nStarted drinking again of my own volition because I put space between me and my emotional triggers. And for the most part it was fine for the first several months. I didn't over do it and I didn't behave in any unconscionable ways. I could drink casually without overdoing it.\n\nThen the big awful scary thing hit out of nowhere and I tanked all my life progress with a flurry of emails I only half-remember sending to the last person I should have ever contacted and, sober, made peace with the fact that I could never contact them again.\n\nI quit drinking because I hated the possibility of what could happen if I was inebriated. My actions could be so dark and deleterious that it didn't make drinking worth it. The catalyst for the first time was a post on social media and a text I shouldn't send. This time it was emails.

It's just a fun way to pass the time for now, though maybe someday I'll make something of it.  \n\nLooking for inspiration, I found this passage in Stephen King's *On Writing* and thought I'd share it with y'all creative types out there.  (King's been sober for almost 30 years, and IMO his recent work is some of his best; more importantly than that, he's *alive.*)\n\n&gt;\"The idea that creative endeavor and mind-altering substances are entwined is one of the great pop-intellectual myths of our time.  The four twentieth-century writers whose work is most responsible for it are probably Hemmingway, Fitzgerald, Sherwood Anderson, and the poet Dylan Thomas.  They are the writers who largely formed our vision of an existential English-speaking wasteland where people have been cut off from one another and live in an atmosphere of emotional strangulation and despair.  These concepts are very familiar to most alcoholics; the common reaction to them is amusement.  Substance-abusing writers are just substance abusers - common garden-variety drunks and druggies, in other words.  Any claims that the drugs and alcohol are necessary to dull a finer sensibility are just the usual self-serving bullshit.  I've heard alcoholic snowplow drivers make the same claim, that they drink to still the demons.  **It doesn't matter if you're James Jones, John Cheever, or a stewbum snoozing in Penn Station; for an addict, the right to the drink or drug of choice must be preserved at all costs.  Hemmingway and Fitzgerald didn't drink because they were creative, alienated, or morally weak.  They drank because it's what alkies are wired up to do.**  Creative people probably *do* run a greater risk of alcoholism and addiction than those in some other jobs, but so what?  We all look pretty much the same when we're puking in the gutter.\"",

I was the party girl, but I hated that because I never was that way before. When I met him, suddenly CRAZY behavior started coming out. I would go insane sometimes, fighting with him. I was always the fun drunk but something about him made me lose a screw. One night I became drunkenly suicidal after what was supposed to be a fun night out with him and friends. I've had several of those, all with him. I feel so bad for what I've put him through... Honestly, I was horrible. Because of that, we quit \"going out\" and binging. Now we take it easy more at home. When we have gone out, I prove to him I won't binge drink. It's manipulation so that he will think I'm fine and without a problem when I drink at home. I think, \"ok, don't get sloppy drunk. Get a little buzz, but no hangover the next morning... that way you can drink regularly at home. You need that more than a party one night\". Crazy!

I now have a glass or two of wine, but pour extra when he's not looking. I've even moved on to hard liquor.  I'm getting skilled at pretending I'm not drunk, but I am almost every single night. Last night he wasn't home \\- he hasn't been home for a week due to a business trip. I drank EVERY NIGHT, alone. Last night I got hammered. I drank a whole bottle of wine \\(I'm petite\\) and made a huge mistake that will likely ruin my relationship. I woke up the next morning and told myself I'm going to quit.

She was very violent towards me but the first person to ever show me lots of attention. She said she would turn me into a young lady both on and off the basketball court and I accepted this because I had nobody else who cared about me at all. Not even my parents who were too busy working their high level jobs and being perfect for all the neighbors. Coach was intense and scary but that made me feel like she cared and the truth is that I am not sure I will ever be able to live up to the experiences I had with her. I didn't tell anybody about us until she said I was too old for her and left me. But nobody took my word seriously back then and cancer got her many years ago so there is no way to prosecute her at this point. I know if a man did what she had done then people would have listened to me. But she always won in the end.\n\nI was skinny and athletic and naive but all of that is long gone now.\n\nI married my WIFE when we were in our early thirties through mutual friends at a lesbian bar. She never offered me the intense experiences Coach did but she seemed like she could be reliable. She put in many hours at her construction job and was laid back so I felt like she could help build an ok life and I also trusted her to not hurt me or put me through more BS. Because that's all I need, right!!!! She was boyish but was very fine with being a woman and never questioned that at all. She said she was proud to be a woman and a lesbian and loved her life as that.\n\nShe became very clingy after a few years of marriage and constantly whined when I was not around or hugging her. She started talking in this ridiculous and disgusting baby voice that humiliated me in front of everyone. Sometimes she would cry during sex and say she knew she could never be as dominant or fulfilling as Coach but she knew she was a better person and that she was the right one for me. All I have ever wanted is to finally be taken seriously and treated like a REAL woman. She was acting like a child and also made ME feel like a child who could not have a simple bad day or a moment alone or a few drinks to unwind. She wanted to \"fix\" me and impress me after everything I have been through in my life. This meant she wanted to prove she could be better than my parents by caring about me and she wanted to top everything Coach ever did.\n\nA few years ago she watched a documentary on transgender people and decided that being transgender would fix all of our problems. She felt that being a man would make her more credible and strong in my eyes. I said fine, you want to be a man....maybe you will grow the hell up and stop being pathetic and stupid and a COMPLETE child. Whatever. Do what you want to do!!!! A few years later and I picked her up from her surgery.\n\nNow life is hell. I am not attracted to men at all and I need a strong WOMAN. The truth is that she barely passes a man, nobody in public ever thinks she is a man. They all think she is a flat chested lesbian. The testosterone made her voice confuse people for a 12 year old and her emotions are so out of whack she really can't stop crying (and I thought it could not get any worse than it was before)!! The breaking point was when she woke me up in the middle of the night after I had a few bottles of wine saying she would break a piece of wood with her fist because she is a real man now and she is stronger than any Coach. I could not take it anymore. I said I don't care what you say, you are not a man, there was NEVER a man. You failed at being a woman and now you are failing even worse at being a man. Now why don't you shut up and leave me the hell alone!!!!\n\nShe said I am broken over Coach and my parents but that is okay because she is willing to step up and be the man I never had in my life. I said who do you think YOU are, I went through hell and I am a better person because of it! What have you been through? Watching September 11 on the TV? YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT FEELS TO STRUGGLE OR BE STRONG.\n\nI am now 100 pounds overweight, often drink two bottles of wine a night, smoke a pack and a half of cigarettes a day. I work in Human Resources which is beyond my own comprehension now because I can barely manage my home life and marriage. He is not my husband, there was never a man, nobody has replaced Coached or filled the void of mom and dad. Bottom line I am raising a child and a \"man\"!!!!\n\nI am not sure what to do but I am in so much pain mentally emotionally physically and everything is ruined. pLEASE HELP ME",

   "selftext": "You know, I wish I could drink like a normal person. I laughed at the thought of me EVER becoming an alcoholic. More and more I'm seeing that drinking is a problem and is affecting my life negatively. I grew up in AA. Literally, I remember being 5 years old and listening to the meeting while I colored. It felt like home. I loved the smell of coffee and cigarettes, and listening to deep conversations. I felt safe there, but never did I think I would end up in their seats. My mom and step father were and still are extremely active in the group. The thought of ME ever sitting in a meeting for myself? Yeah, that's humorous \\- but I'm seeing now that I probably need it.\n\nI began drinking socially every Friday night out with friends about a year and a half ago. Before then I could go out to bars and clubs, and have no desire to drink. I didn't understand the appeal until my first drunken night and it was over from there. I was at the time \\(now engaged and living with my fianc\u00e9\\) a single mom who needed the outlet. But I began going out more, leaving my son with babysitters. The time out got longer and how drunk I was got worse. I remember experiencing my first hangover and saying I'll never do that again. That was a lie. I was drinking to get over my narcissistic ex whom I was deeply in love with and hurt by.\n\nFast\\-foward to when I met my fianc\u00e9 a little over a year ago. I was the party girl, but I hated that because I never was that way before. When I met him, suddenly CRAZY behavior started coming out. I would go insane sometimes, fighting with him. I was always the fun drunk but something about him made me lose a screw. One night I became drunkenly suicidal after what was supposed to be a fun night out with him and friends. I've had several of those, all with him. I feel so bad for what I've put him through... Honestly, I was horrible. Because of that, we quit \"going out\" and binging. Now we take it easy more at home. When we have gone out, I prove to him I won't binge drink. It's manipulation so that he will think I'm fine and without a problem when I drink at home. I think, \"ok, don't get sloppy drunk. Get a little buzz, but no hangover the next morning... that way you can drink regularly at home. You need that more than a party one night\". Crazy! Just this past weekend we went out with friends and I watched a few of my friends get shit\\-faced. I told my fianc\u00e9, \"aren't you happy I'm not drinking like that anymore?\" It's disgusting, but I did that to get the \"free pass\" to drink more. If I'm not out of control \\(seemingly\\) then he won't be mad at me for drinking. I've even began to hide it, though. :\\(\n\nYet, my drinking at night never stopped. I now have a glass or two of wine, but pour extra when he's not looking. I've even moved on to hard liquor. I'm getting skilled at pretending I'm not drunk, but I am almost every single night. Last night he wasn't home \\- he hasn't been home for a week due to a business trip. I drank EVERY NIGHT, alone. Last night I got hammered. I drank a whole bottle of wine \\(I'm petite\\) and made a huge mistake that will likely ruin my relationship. I woke up the next morning and told myself I'm going to quit. I considered a meeting, but wouldn't want my fianc\u00e9 to know I was going, so I didn't go. I don't want to admit I have a problem. If I admit that, then I have to really quit. Does that make sense? Like I would normally be having my first drink of the night \\(9pm\\) after my son is asleep... but I'm TRYING to resist. I honestly might drink tonight.... but at least I'm admitting this. I'm afraid of quitting because I equate drinking with fun. How will I ever have fun or mask any of my emotional pain again? UGH. This sucks. I want to stop, but I can't!!!\n\nBecoming sober always sounds appealing until I want a drink.",

   "selftext": "I'm kind of shy and I've been lurking this sub for a while. I'm 30 years old, male, and I decided to divorce alcohol on May 9th. My last drink was two forties of Steel Reserve the night before. The first two days were rough but I\u2019m feeling happier, brighter, and more positive and energetic than I have in years. I joined because being part of a community of people who know what it\u2019s like will make recovery easier.\n\nI've always kind of felt awkward calling myself an \"alcoholic\" because I didn't do stereotypical \"alcoholic\" things. I never lost a job because of drinking, or a relationship, or drove drunk and I rarely blacked out (I think only twice). I've only thrown up from drinking maybe 5-10 times in ~7 years of drinking heavily. \n\nI \"quit drinking forever\" countless times, usually after a crippling hangover. After the hangover subsided in a day or two a helpful voice inside my head would talk me down from the ledge: *\"You were just being rash, I mean come on it wasn't THAT bad. You're better now and you learned your lesson about drinking too much. It was a stressful day at work and you deserve a little drink to unwind. You can always quit later.\"* The voice made compelling arguments and I fell into another cycle. \n\nOnce I start drinking the only thing that matters is getting more alcohol. Moderation goes out the window the moment I feel the alcohol kicking in.\n\nI've noticed with increasing alarm the past year that I couldn\u2019t stick to my limits anymore. I set myself the nightly limit of first half a bottle of whisky (375mL) which then became 500mL, then 583.333 (1/3rd of a handle), which then became \"anything less than a fifth\" (amazing alcoholic logic: drinking *almost* a bottle of whisky a night is okay because there\u2019s maybe half an inch left in the bottle).\n\nBesides, I\u2019m functional, right? It\u2019s not affecting my work. Except I\u2019m hungover every day but I keep allergy eyedrops in the car, putting them in at stoplights on the way into work so my bloodshot eyes are nice and clear and white by the time I\u2019m at my desk. They\u2019re still glassy and watery of course, and puffy with dark circles under them. And I can\u2019t really focus because my head is pounding and I\u2019m dehydrated and dizzy and I think I may puke at any minute and I didn\u2019t eat breakfast or sleep well. But I put a smile on and force myself to act energetic. Usually by 1-2 PM it subsides and I start feeling a bit better. By the time I get home at 4:30 I\u2019m completely dead, after working hungover and the effort of pretending to be okay for 8 hours. I fix myself a drink and eat dinner. Then another drink, and another and another until I\u2019m completely shitfaced. I make sure to go to bed with a big glass of water and if I\u2019m lucky I can get myself back to sleep when I wake up, heart racing, at 3 or 4 in the morning. \n\nThis was my daily life until last Wednesday. I was at the grocery store about to buy a box of Franzia and something just snapped and I said to myself \u201cI don\u2019t need this shit anymore\u201d and I put the box on the shelf and I haven\u2019t looked back. It wasn\u2019t dramatic, there wasn\u2019t much emotion at all. I\u2019m just tired of feeling like shit and killing my ambition and feelings and *paying for the privilege*.\n\nThis past week has been more fulfilling and I\u2019ve been more alive and happier than I can ever remember. Everyone around me has been telling me how much better I look. I\u2019m waking up to a clear head and a happy heart. Many physical aches and pains are gone, so much inflammation and water weight has resolved. My mental health has improved drastically too, I feel happy and calm instead of sad and anxious all the time. \n\nI want to grab everyone I see and shout *\u201dNOT BEING HUNGOVER AND SLEEPING WELL AND HAVING A CLEAR MIND FEELS SO GODDAMN GOOD!!!\u201d*  but that would probably be a bit much :p \n\nI can\u2019t drink in moderation so I\u2019m not drinking at all. **I\u2019m not depriving myself of anything. I\u2019m depriving alcohol of me**.\n",

Almost a year ago i came down to sunny south florida \\(ft. lauderdale\\) to go to rehab. I had just gotten my second DUI and was feeling at the end of my rope. \n\nWell, 338 days later, Im out of the halfway house, have a job i love, my own place, money in the bank, great AA friends, and my family is proud of me.\n\nMore important than all that material stuff is that today I know I have a choice. I know what to do when i feel like drinking \\(call someone, and most importantly don't drink!\\)\n\nLet me just be clear, this hasn't been easy. There have bee many ups and downs, many times when my mind was screaming for a drink so bad, times when the conditions were just right and if i hadn't had the knowledge i have, my old self would've been drunk.\n\nBut I've learned that I'm stronger than i ever thought i was. I value different things than i used to. Hell, I bought TWO plants the other day for my new place. Im happy with where I am, and Im grateful for what I have.\n\nDrinking almost killed me numerous times, and made my life into a directionless mess where chasing the next cheap drunk \\(Busch and bottle shelf whiskey was my thing\\) was all that mattered.\n\nTo hear my parents and friends tell me they're proud of me and to wake up each day without a hangover or that crushing self loathing is truly a gift for this alcoholic.\n\nLike I said, its not easy. It never will be. But if you put your head down and just focus on making it through this one day, ask for help if you need it, and reach out to someone else, and don't pick up no matter what you can do it.\n\n\\-Rob",

It literally effects nothing except our marriage (his job is going great), and I\u2019m to the point where I have to detach emotionally, or be so upset that we fight!

I love him so much, I want to be with him-we\u2019ve been together 11 years and married for 4.\n\nWhen we talk about it he agrees to counseling but it never happens, one time he went with me and then walked out right before our session started.

I was working late and he got home early...instead of doing a single thing around the house, or the badly needed grocery shopping he bought a case of IPA and 4 boxes of whippets. And then again tonight he was out with work guys at a baseball game and came home at midnight with his car music blaring, I watched him stumble and fall out of his car and then he couldn\u2019t even get his clothes off before he fell in bed.

He had quite a party first though \\- I posted this the other day, but when I went to take him to detox at noon, he ended up going to the ER instead with a BAC of .473.  He's on his 2nd day of detox and we've had a few awkward conversations.  He still hasn't acknowledged to me that he was drinking behind my back and lying about it, or apologize for anything \\(I wanted to say goodbye before detox...\\).  I've now overheard him tell the nurse and his mom and others how much and how often he was drinking and I'm so angry to find out how much he lied to me, that I want to leave him.    He did what I asked and got help, but the problem was way, way worse than I realized.  I didn't sign up for this.  I have two young kids and I don't want to be a babysitter to him anymore.  I'm so exhausted.  I just want to pack our stuff and leave.  I've got maybe 5 weeks until he comes home.  Maybe my mind will change, but I just don't see it.  I'm assuming this is a normal reaction.  He's been drinking too much since we started dating 12 years ago, but I have no idea when 'the alcoholism' began, when he started waking up and drinking vodka.  When I think of the number of conversations we've had about drinking, and honesty, and who knows what else, I just want to take all his stuff to his mom's house, contact a divorce attorney and contact a realtor.  Sorry, just need to rant. I've only been fully privy to this for 2 days and will seek help asap.    ",

   "selftext": "Hey people. I'm on my first trip to Japan. One week in to a two week stint. I'm laying in bed at the hostel at 1.14am. I just realised that I am one month sober today. \n\nThe trip has been very up and down. I find my mood fluctuates based on the smallest little things. I can be fine one moment, then a minor inconvenience can make me very irritable or anxious. I started smoking cigarettes because they are so cheap here but that only made the anxiety worse so I trashed them. Actually since I trashed the cigs my mood has been much better.\n\nI feel like maybe I've had a little breakthrough. The first few days were hellish, especially because I am in a group of five travellers, one of which is a hard drinking buddy of mine. If I had not been on antabuse, I would have caved at the very first can of Asahi in the airport vending machine. I was googling \"can you drink on Antabuse?\" for the first few days of the trip. I got mixed responses, but some stories were enough to scare me into staying sober.\n\nAnyway, I feel like I am finally getting used to not drinking. I bought a book at the airport in Australia: \"the unexpected joy of being sober\". It has been a huge encouragement. I have chaperoned my hard drinking buddy around the bars and alleyways of Kyoto, Because I was sober, I could; keep us from getting lost, keep my friend from walking into traffic and also appreciate all the amazing sights. Its nice to be present in each moment and know that I will actually remember all the sights and experiences. \n\nBut by far the best part is how happy my girlfriend is. For the first time in years we can wander into the chaotic kaleidoscope of noghtlife and she doesn't have to worry that I will become a sloppy, obnoxious lunatic. I am drinking plenty of interesting non-alcoholic drinks like yuzu soda, iced Oolong tea and delicious matcha tea. And Im saving a ton of money that I can spend on souvenirs instead. There are just so many benefits to not drinking. I am finally starting to feel like Im not missing out, but rather I am gaining so much. It's like the rose-coloured veil of alcohol has been lifted from my eyes. I am noticing how boring people are when they are drunk and how drinking glues people to particular spots instead of experiencing other things and exploring. I feel like I am much funnier and responsive in conversations when I am sober.\n\nAnyway, I know this is a massive post but I guess its my way of celebrating my one month sober and also I hope it encourages anybody who has something like a party or a holiday coming up and is anxious about being sober. It may be hard at first, but once you realise that you don't need alcohol. The grass truly is much much greener. \n\nOh and for anybody thinking about antabuse, it has worked wonders for me. Just dont take it if you really think you cant go without a drink for a good few weeks. ",

On the 6th day, I had a really strange dream. It involved my ex and lots of partying, and I woke up feeling like shit. I had this fucked up feeling of really needing something to relax, and I ended up drinking a beer. Then two. Then at night 3 more beers. I stopped there, and ended up smoking weed with a friend. Deep down I already knew that my sober streak was over. Yesterday I got crazy drunk, let another drunk friend drive my car at 7am and we bought more weed from a complete stranger who ended up going with us in the car. I have a Huge hangover today, and honestly I would do it all again. Those 5 days sober felt good, but not optimal. I felt dead inside, frustrated, overanalytical of my own thoughts and actions, bored, sad, and lonely. So very lonely. I realized that that's what I'm running away from with booze. When I'm drunk, everything is a possibility: I mighht spend the night with that girl, or that, or that other one, but the reality is that the odds of that happening are low, and regret usually comes the next morning. I spend copious amounts of money when I go out. \n\nAnyway, today I had the opportunity to go out with some friends again. I wont do it. I'd get very drunk again. It would happen on saturday, too. So atleast now I'm conscious of this cycle and am breaking it right now, even if the thought of going out is terribly appealing. \n\nSorry for the long post, but I really had to get this out of my head.

I wish it didn't- especially since I'm fully aware that my disappointment is coming from the romanticized memory of that awesome first summer I had when i moved here (right after I started dating an alcoholic and picked up the habit, but before I spiraled out of control and gained 65lbs). Our days were filled with river time, 12 packs and blunts. We hiked, we went fishing, we stargazed. We had great beer (I live in the land of microbreweries). We had great times. \n\n\n\nBut then I completely lost control, finished my seasonal job last October, and haven't even truly looked for work since. Because it's a small town and wherever I work I am bound to eventually run into old coworkers or friends- people that knew me when I was slim and fit and active and HAPPY. Since the end of that job last year my days have been filled with nothing but depression, shame and regret for the path I went down and how I fucked myself over royally. \n\n\nBut now that relationship with an alcoholic is over, and I have an opportunity to turn a new leaf and start my life again. It's just the thought of being unable to enjoy a cold beer by the river is depressing me more. \n\n\nI know this isn't the kind of post that makes anyone happy or encouraged, and I know that this FOMO will pass, but I just needed to vent.

Come Friday night, there he goes again. Sunday morning, he's hungover and having diarrhea. And this is his routine every week for the past 5 years. We go visit our parents, he gets drunk again. The last vacation we spent together he was drinking every day and we had financial problems afterwards \\(from his spending on alcohol\\).

   "selftext": "Okay so here\u2019s the deal.\n\nI have been dating a guy for about a year and a few months. He\u2019s a really special, fine guy. He has lots of talents and is very charming and supportive and loving. However, he has severe mental health and addiction issues. \n\nWe moved very quickly into a serious relationship after we both got sober a month or so into our relationship.  We\u2019d been really open with each other about our codependent tendencies and trying to be better together. He\u2019s seen all these benefits to getting sober, but recently his mental health has taken a turn for the worst. \n\nHe is an admitted workaholic, and as he\u2019s tried to create boundaries between him and his work, he\u2019s basically had a mental breakdown. Like, couldn\u2019t stand he was in so much emotional anguish. I took him to the emergency room and he was transferred to a shithole behavioral health center for a week until he was no longer suicidal. \n\nHe came back from the facility optimistic but hadn\u2019t really received significant assistance, except that they got him in with a weekly psychiatrist and psychologist. \n\nFast forward to this last weekend:\n\nI visited my mom for Mother\u2019s Day (five hours away). I felt like I hadn\u2019t been able to leave town for a while because of my dude\u2019s anxiety, and on Sunday morning he just stopped texting me. I called him, he answered, and told me he doesn\u2019t want to do it anymore. That he couldn\u2019t. He was crying and angry and downright sounded delusional. I wouldn\u2019t wish that phone call on anyone. I tried to keep him on the line and make him promise to me that he wouldn\u2019t hurt himself, and he just told me he thought he needed to take a nap and promised me he wasn\u2019t lying. \n\nThankfully I did not trust him at his word. I called a friend who was close by to go to his house, and another friend who called a police wellness check on him and called an attorney for an involuntary hospital admission if he refused to get help. The friend who headed to his house found him with his pills out about to take them. They talked until his mother made it up to his house and took him to his psychologist, who referred him to a nicer facility where he is now. He\u2019s now stabilized but will probably be there for a while. \n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019m watching his dogs (who I also love but are a lot to handle), and developed a flea infestation, so I had to stay with a friend for a night and bomb everything and take a day from work to clean. I drove three hours to see him last night for an hour of visitation, and I\u2019ve been staying with his mom (who is wonderful) every night. \n\nI feel responsible for him because everyone in his life has told him that I saved him\u2014not just from his suicide attempts, but by intervening in his alcoholism.\n\nI\u2019m scared that I got myself in too deep with a person I thought I could fix because of things that happened to me in my childhood. I\u2019m so scared that he\u2019s going to get out again prematurely and I\u2019ll have to get him to a hospital again, or worse, find him dead. \n\nWhen he\u2019s feeling good, he\u2019s wonderful. No one deserves to feel the kind of anguish he felt on Sunday night when he tried to kill himself. I\u2019m just afraid I\u2019m not strong enough to love him through this, and if I step out of the situation I\u2019m afraid he will not make it. I should say\u2014he\u2019s feeling better at the moment, and I\u2019m very hopeful he\u2019ll recover. But I don\u2019t know if I want to take the chance that he won\u2019t. I don\u2019t know that I want to be around if this treatment doesn\u2019t work. This has all been so painful and I feel like an awful person for even thinking of giving up on him.\n\nI\u2019m trying to get in with a counselor but the place that I found that takes my insurance can\u2019t schedule me for two more weeks. I can\u2019t talk to my family because I feel like they expect me to be okay always. A lot of my friends have been asking where I\u2019ve been lately, and I can\u2019t tell them. They think I\u2019m an asshole for dropping out on them but I feel like I\u2019m struggling just to keep everything going. I feel like I\u2019m dysfunctional at work because I\u2019m so distracted. \n\nEverything everything everything hurts right now. I lost my dad a few years back and this feels like the shock of that loss but protracted because I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to lose him or not. I don\u2019t want to hurt myself but I kinda feel the impulse to run away even though I know that\u2019s not an option.\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend tried to commit suicide and I\u2019ve been in the position of directing him to be admitted.\nFeeling crushed under the tremendous weight of keeping someone else going. Having trouble completing everyday things for myself. Also, my apartment developed a flea infestation and I can\u2019t stop vacuuming.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n",

I started going to AA again, and while I've enjoyed some meetings and met some good people, last night I had an annoying encounter with an old fellow at the end of the meeting. I shared about my early sobriety, how I'm dealing with resentments, and my history with alcoholic family members and old crises. I recently found out my father has been 8 months sober (we haven't been close since I started trying to stop 3 years ago, but touched base when I called home for Mothers Day). That among a few other moments and realizations made Monday a successful Day 1. Anyhow, a fellow came up to me after the meeting and asked sharply \"What step are you on?\" I said \"well, 3, and I'm redoing my step 4 tomo...\" \"Do you have a sponsor?\" he interupted. \"Only a temporary one ri\" I said. \"YOU NEED A SPONSOR WHO'LL KICK YOU IN THE ASS SO YOU'LL STAY SOBER\". I was just shocked. Having alcoholics kick me in the butt growing up is a big reason why I developed a drinking problem. \n\nI got really angry, waved him off, and wanted to go straight to the liquor store, but I decided to keep it cool and came home first to relax and read some of the stuff in this group again.

I heard this and instead of finding one ounce of it funny, I cried all the way to the bar.\n\nYou see, 'I was them' too.  My life was in a downward spiral after 18 years of daily drinking.  My son was too much of a challenge, I was a few months separated from my husband who almost killed me by choking me when I pushed on his shoulder and asked him to roll over because he was snoring (he was/is an alcoholic as well and was not only drunk but had taken ambien, which I had no idea... not that it would have changed my actions), I was becoming increasingly paranoid about my job because my drinking was interfering with my ability to think far too much and I basically wanted to die.  EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.  I drove from work to the bar and thought about and looked for opportunities to kill myself where it looked like an accident (you know, more insurance money for the kids that way).\n\nI pretty much drove buzzed or drunk all of the time with the exception of leaving work.  I was usually fairly 'not drunk' by the time I got off of work.  I used to pray to be pulled over and arrested for a DUI.  I thought that might help me quit drinking.  It never happened, in fact, I was renting the house I did because it was only 800 steps to the bar (1200ish home, thanks fitbit) and that limited my driving a bit in the evenings.\n\nIt just got worse and worse.  I knew I was an alcoholic for years but my downward spiral was taking away everything but the drink for me.  Then things started to happen...\n\nI heard this recording on the radio, a friend of mine passed from liver cancer (absolutely alcohol related), another person I knew who was only in his early 30's died from this disease, I found out my brother had come home from treatment a few months before.  I didn't even know he had gone.  My kids no longer wanted to be home and stayed at their friend's houses, I did things like sleep and pee on the front porch bench (often) because I couldn't figure out how to get in the house, you know... stuff like that.\n\nThen one day, I sent my brother a text.  It said \"I want to quit drinking but I don't know how\".  He immediately texted me back and wanted to meet after work.  I said no because I knew that would interfere with the start of my drinking time.  He texted me back and said we would meet for lunch.  I went and only pushed my food around my plate a bit.  I only ate about once per day at that point and it was in the evening after I had a few power drinks and had gotten rid of the nausea I felt all day everyday at work.  \n\nSomehow it was decided that he would take me to treatment.  A week and a half later he arrived to pick me up at 9 am to go.  Of course, I was already drunk at the bar at that point but he figured it out and came and got me and I got in the car with a full drink and we headed out for the 4 hour drive.  It took another bottle to get me there, but I'm happy to say it was the last bottle I drank.\n\nI was desperate to get sober.  I did it all, I worked hard, I felt great and then on the day I woke up to leave treatment, my first thought was 'thank God I'm leaving so I can have a drink now'... That thought came out of nowhere and those thoughts still hit me but I just don't take that first drink.\n\nMy life is so much better now,  I am happy, I own a home, have a nice car, pay all of my bills on time and still have a bit of of cash left over to do whatever I want with.  I've had a few promotions at my job and I'm getting married to yet another alcoholic in a couple of weeks.  The difference this time, is that he has been sober for 14 years!\n\nMy life is so much better than it was on October 26th, 2012 but I know in my heart of hearts that one drink would destroy all of that.  I still think about the 'I am them' lady all of these years later and I often say it as well when the situation is right (kind of like there by the Grace of God go I).\n\nThank you kind stranger for your part in my sobriety and decision to get sober.  I pray your life is what you want it to be as well!",

   "selftext": "I share my story in the hopes it will give someone the hope and strength they need to have the same experience I had to recover from alcoholism.  \nI was a nervous kid with lots of anxieties and adhd. I was off the walls and my head would never stop talking to me, I always seemed to overthink stuff. I never really felt like I was part of the group, like I was always on the outside looking in, even though I had friends.  I was never comfortable in my own skin. When I found booze I knew I found what was missing, looking back I was instantly addicted. I loved it, it made me feel like I could be the person I thought I wanted to be. I turned my life over to booze at the age of 13. Everything came second to booze. I chose a career where I could drink everyday working night shift as a waiter in restaurants. I had a shit tonne of fun and I was right in the middle of the action, I had arrived, I felt not only a part of, but almost like a leader of the party crew we had. Little did I know alcohol is a progressive disease and always gets worse, never better. My grandpa always said do something you love for a career, well I loved booze so I became a bartender... Lol.. (probably not what he meant) I ended up getting into cocaine which led me to my first treatment center. Funny thing is I wanted to quit coke so I could keep drinking, I never wanted to quit drinking, how could I ever have fun again without booze, life would be boring and mundane.... Shit was I wrong. Left that treatment center to drink the first night out. Then I moved towns and cocaine wasn't easy to find. I would come home after work and drink a 26er (750ml) of vodka by myself, pass out and wake up and puke a little bit..... Amazingly I actually thought I was doing good because I wasn't doing coke. My alcoholism progressed and I discovered the morning drink which was the death of me. I would drink the morning drink, trigger my allergy and keep drinking. In the end, after 20 yrs of hardcore drinking I had progressed to drinking around the clock, 4 or 5 day blackouts and I kept ending up on the hospital for medical detox as I was scared I would get seizures and die... It happens!.. Another treatment center only to drink the first day I got out again. In and out of AA for years, coming back over 30 times!... I was a hopeless alcoholic. I did want to drink but I couldn't imagine a life without it. How would I have the confidence to pick up women? To hang out with friends and be funny and the life of the party? How would I live life? I always had alcohol as a crutch to get me through the hard stuff in life.... Finally my family didn't want to talk to me anymore, not cus I was a bad drunk but they just couldn't stand by and watch me die, or come get their baby from the hospital shaking and on deaths door.... Again and again..... Finally my last drunk was a 4 day blackout, I knew I was going to die a lonely painful alcoholic death. I know to the core of my being that no matter what I do, I can not stop myself from picking up that first drink! I stood at the turning point, I was either going to commit suicide or completely turn my life over to a God I don't even think exists. I said to myself well if there is a God, I'm going to find out.... I got on my knees and I prayed, not like before but I honestly meant it and was willing to believe (there's no atheists when the plane is going down) I prayed to \"God\" and said I don't care what you would have me be, I completely give myself to you. You can have all of me and I meant it. I felt a weird feeling, like a 100 pound weight was taken from my shoulders. I was sick of following all the opinions and advice in AA, there is so much conflicting advice it's brutal. I said this time, I am doing it exactly how the first 100 men and women did it, if it isn't in the big book, I'm not doing it, nothing more, nothing less. It really worked back then, not now with all the treatment center bullshit. I studied that book like my life depended on it. I got a sponsor, I made a daily plan. Wake up, pray, make bed, red daily reflections, go to moon meeting, go to gym, read big nook, then night meeting, pray and go to bed. I did a meeting or 2 a day for the first year. I did my steps in the first 3 weeks, which is exactly how they are supposed to be done. I did them right out of the big book with the help of the Joe and Charlie speaker tapes... They are so amazing. They explain the book better than I've ever heard, I finally understood what to do... Today I am 9 yrs sober and I still call Joe and Charlie my program sponsors. I completely gave myself to AA even though I didn't believe in God and I hated AA and all those \"religious people\" and lame losers.... I found an amazing life. I made friends. I got involved with young people groups and we would go to dances and roundups, and bowling and kareoke and camping etc etc, I was the life of the sober party! I felt comfortable in my own skin! With the help of AA and \"God\" I walked through all those fears and lived life on life's terms and I thrived! ...... I started sponsoring people and they started getting sober. I ran Joe and Charlie step groups and helped others through the steps. I had a home group that I contributed to and ran the newcomers meeting for them before the main meeting. Today my life is honestly beyond my wildest dreams. When I sobered up I just wanted a little apartment and that would be great. I went back to school multiple times for different things, I learned how to be a mechanic and fix up jetskis and motorbikes, something I always wanted. I worked on boats and got other professional designations through school. I got jobs in top management for hospitality. Today I run my own successful business. I am happily married and have a dog and young daughter that makes me happier than I ever imagined I could be. I have a bunch of jetskis, boat, motorbike, etc. I own my own house on a large property. My life is amazing and I owe it all to AA...... If it weren't for AA I would be dead. I was a hopeless alcohol doomed to an alcoholic death but I was plucked from my own insanity by a power greater than me and have recovered from that seemingly hopeless state of mind and body.......i truly hope you all find your way. When. I tried to sober up without AA, sobriety was always something to endure, or fight through, and was very painful, with AA it made it so sobriety was something to be celebrated and enjoyed",

   "selftext": "Hello SD, Happy Friday! Like the title says \"How do I celebrate 6 months\"?\nJust a little backstory... I am an alcoholic, there is a lot of reasons as to why I quit drinking. It was one day I didn't want to drink, and the next day I walked into AA to see if they could help me stay sober. \nI had nothing... my clothes were kept at a buddys in town. My electronics were kept at my moms 45 mins away. I slept in a laundry mat or a park. A week after being sober my mom took me in full time. I had a job close to hers at a liquor store and we worked almost the same hours. Things worked out, eventually 2 months into sobriety I got a full time job closer to my moms house. I worked very hard to save my money and in only a month and a half I was ready to put down rent and a security deposit. I have been on my own for 2 months now. i'm very comfortable being by myself, and true to my sobriety. I have spent a lot of my money earned on getting started... things for the apartment, rent, bills, security deposits on bills, food, ect...\n\nI paid all upcoming bills yesterday and rent will be paid with my next check. I have some extra money, I dont want to spend a lot but I feel like I should do something nice for myself. My 6th month of sobriety is next Saturday, I haven't \"celebrated\" any months prior, but obviously this one is a huge milestone for me. \n\nAny ideas would be awesome SD or just hearing what you've done to celebrate would a) be fun to read and b) maybe point me in the right direction. Thanks for reading   \n\n",

   "selftext": "I'm a 22 year old white male who is 5'5\" and weighs 168 lbs. Taking no meds. I've been getting some heart palpitations as of late. They come out of no where for no reason. The first incident came a couple days ago when I was sitting on a sofa chair for quite a while. Suddenly my heart started fluttering and I have a loss of breath, slight dizziness. \n\nThe symptoms wouldn't go away so I visited the campus doctors. She said it was caused by my anxiety, which I find skeptical because I don't feel anxious but maybe I've suppressed it. It makes sense considering my situation. My a college senior whose about to graduate in a couple days, I don't know if I'll have a job afterwards and my most likely prospect is super shit. I've made no close friends for the past 4 years and I've been depressed. \n\nBut then I got another incident of palpitations while I was sleeping, same symptoms and it woke me up. The subsided faster this time, and I wasn't too worried about them. That incident reminded me of the time I had high cholesterol as a kid. I'm fat and I've struggled with my weight my entire life, but only do I eye realize that the 1 time incident I had breathing problems as a kid was actually heart palpitations? \n\nNow I just got back from running 20 minutes straight at the gym, like I usually do. This has been the first time however, since these heart palpitations started and I noticed that my heart beating much more strongly after the exercise than usual. I felt some heart beats skip and a feeling akin to heart burn. Some moments I had to stop and literally catch my breath. It sucks feeling that I'm about to keel over and die at 22. So now I'm starting to question whether it's just anxiety or something physiological. My diet hasn't been great as of late for the last 3 days or so, but it has been FAAAR shitter before and I didn't have these palpitations then. \n\nTonight is Friday and I usually drink 4 beers tonight and I really really really want to. But I'm also a bit nervous about these palpitations. Should I abstain from alcohol completely? Note that I really really want to drink something. Can I have at least two bottles? Or am I just being anxious? I must admit my hands are trembling a bit as I type this and I am short of breath. Should I stop exercising? ",

   "selftext": "First time poster, I think. Long time lurker. Hangxiety is really kicking my ass today and I kept asking myself, when am I going to take the plunge and admit that I'm an alcoholic? On the drive home from school I was going over all the ways that I've hurt myself by drinking. The first words that really resonated with me were  \"I've had enough.\"\n\nWays I've hurt myself:    \nI keep breaking things that I own and treasure.   \nMy eyelids are swelling every day now and it's making me look old.    \nI embarrass myself when I'm blackout in public.   \nMy skin is getting this dry leathery appearance.   \nVeins appearing on my face.   \nI'm not focusing on school or doing homework.   \nNeglecting friendships when I'm too hung over to talk to anyone.   \nWeight gain - I weigh 40 lbs more than I've ever weighed in my life.   \nMy hamster doesn't like me when I drink.   \nMessy house.   \nI may not have enough money for rent this month.   \nBut I don't know because in my depressive alcoholic state, I don't check my account.   \nI missed my 10 year high school reunion because I was too embarrassed about my lifestyle.   \nI say stupid things in front of my fiance and don't remember them.   \nBlack eyes, twice.\nMajor injury to my head from falling off skateboard.    \nPermanent scars from falling off skateboard.  \n   \n    \nWhat I plan to gain!     \n    \nI'm going to have money!     \nI will lose my gut!    \nI'll have time to take care of my life and my baby hamster!    \nSo much money!    \nWhich means road trips!    \nAnxiety and depression will be gone!!    \nMy car will be beautiful!    \nI'll finally be able to buy clothes that I love!    \nI going to remember people and events more!    \nI can go be a waitress this summer and I won't have to worry about embarrassing myself in front of coworkers!    \nI'll be able to finish all the projects I've piled up!    \nNo more feeling sick all the time!!    \nNo more hiding my drinking from my fiance!    \nI'm going to be a total babe!    \n    \nMore to come! But I'm just thankful that the way to fix literally everything wrong on my life relies on ONE thing, and all I have to do is NOT do something! Wild! \n\nThank you for reading.",

   "selftext": "I am 30 years old and have a history of drinking very heavily. I have blacked out countless times. I have driven drunk countless times and several times not even remembering the drive home or the end of the night at which point I decided to leave wherever I was. I have done many embarrassing things while drunk such as making out with a girl that I would not have otherwise chosen in a very public popular hometown bar, falling asleep at a bar and being kicked out for trying to take off my shoes because my feet were swelling up, cheating on my girlfriend by going to a strip club and getting a blow job from the stripper during a private dance, passing out at a country concert and getting wheeled out by the paramedics in front of my girlfriend and her family, passing out on the floor at my parents house and waking up in a puddle of urine only to have my mother\u2019s heart broken when she found out what happened later, blowing-out the tires on my truck when I smashed into a curb in a parking lot while driving recklessly, showing up to work so hungover I was running to the bathroom every 20 minutes to puke and reeking of alcohol still, etc. the list goes on...passing out on the couch at parties, missing the ball drop on New Years, hitting on coworkers that are friends but have boyfriends already, hooking up with the wrong people and then creating more awkwardness for myself later, posting embarrassing videos to Snapchat that I will later regret cause I just look stupid and wasted...on and on it goes. \n\nI have taken many breaks from alcohol of course. A week here a month there. Usually after something really bad happens... but I always say, ok I\u2019ll never do that again. I\u2019ll just stop drinking once I\u2019ve had my fill and I\u2019ll uber home. It starts slow usually. A few glasses of wine a night. A bottle of wine a few nights a week just to relax after a hard stressful day. To forget how bored I am of life. Or how pathetic my behavior has been. To forget how disappointed I am in myself. Sometimes it seems like I have it under control for months and months at a time. Nothing too bad happening. Only mild hangovers. And then one night I just feel too good about myself and I want to celebrate. Maybe someone strokes my ego and I feel like I deserve to live it up! I am thirsty, and after all I haven\u2019t gone hard in a while so fuck it. I go hard. I am a bottomless pit. I have an unquenchable thirst for more. I tell myself that the bartender must love me right now for the bill I\u2019m racking up. I am egotistical and cocky. Throwing caution to the wind. Autopilot. The judicial system in my brain is switched off and I act before I think. I don\u2019t think I just do things impulsively. God have mercy!! Drink after drink. Sometimes I am horrified looking back at how much I had. Nobody seems to notice either! I hold my liquor very well all the way up until the last few that just shut me down. 5 or 6 hours later I am waking up early in the morning for water and getting small fragmented flashbacks of the night before. I already know I am going to be riddled with guilt and shame once the rest of the booze are processed by my liver and kidneys. Never! Never again I say!!! \n\nI last had a drink about 9 days ago. It was more than a drink; it was nearly an entire bottle of Cazadores tequila. I wanted to get away so I decided to go camping. I went out by myself to the beach. A solo camping trip. I knew I wouldn\u2019t need to drive once I was at the campsite since I had everything I needed out there. There weren\u2019t many other campers there so I basically had the place to myself. I started with a few beers early on. Eventually I switched to the grapefruit and tequila. (Much more tequila than grapefruit.) I sat by the fire and I got shit faced by myself in the woods by the beach. The next day I was terribly hungover. Perhaps even poisoned. I threw up I think seven times and couldn\u2019t hold food down for very long. I was even laughing at how ridiculous of a person I am choosing to be. I have been listening to a lot of Jordan Peterson lately and I am really trying to apply his ideas to my life. I know it is not enough to just think about it, I have to stay committed to sobriety. \n\nI have been sober for 9 days now and have been running and working out almost everyday. I have also been eating really well. Low carb and healthy lean fats and veggies. I feel great. I look healthy and I feel healthy. My thinking feels clear and sharp and fast. I have been keeping busy, catching up on audibles, getting things done, taking care of business. I don\u2019t want this healthy feeling to go away and so the few times I have been tempted to go out for a beer this past week, I chose not to. I choose a big healthy meal instead. Sometimes I can\u2019t get to sleep until 3 in the morning, but fuck it. Being a little tired the next day is still better than the alternative that I just described above. If you are reading this and you are like me, just know you will be happy you didn\u2019t drink today. It\u2019s Friday. You might feel lame for staying in. That\u2019s ok. Tomorrow will come. Little by little you will accomplish your goals. You will be better. If you\u2019re feeling like you need an escape, don\u2019t. Stay and fight. Don\u2019t choose weakness. Get angry. Get edgy. Feel frustration. Be ok with the suffering. That\u2019s ok. Go be better. Go do better. Go be harder. \n\nGodspeed. \ud83e\udd19",

   "selftext": "Woohoo! I made a post recently enough about considering whether or not to drink at my upcoming secondary school graduation, and the occasion passed just last night - and sober too! It wasn't easy, I won't lie. After the ceremony we were told to get dressed in the school classrooms, and the drinking began then. Everyone whipped out bottles of vodka and cheap bottles of wine and began to neck them together. It was a bit uncomfortable and isolating at that point, being awkwardly ready to leave but everyone still pre-drinking and dancing around made me feel like I stood out a lot, but I know nobody paid any heed realistically. Usually I would be the \"life of the party\" in those moments amongst my old friends outside of school, and when I don't have many friends in my school, I wanted desperately to join in and almost prove myself to them that I was fun and bubbly too, yada, yada.\nThe night itself was enlightening in so many ways. Before leaving the school, we were invited to chat with teachers and get some food, take some photos, and all that. I finally introduced my favourite teacher to my wonderful boyfriend, and I was so, so proud to tell her we wouldn't be drinking. It was refreshing, and motivating, and made it really felt worth it. \nWhen we reached the pub I spoke a while to my French teacher. Usually I would be very shy around her, and I know that if I was drinking around her I would definitely be thinking to myself \"god she probably just thinks I am really drunk and acting stupid\". I hate that feeling when I'm drunk talking to somebody sober, or less drunk than me - thinking that they are cringing at me and judging me. It's always especially worse when paired with the \"I know I am drunk but I mean this\" ramble.\nThe amount of money that we saved too was so exciting! Pubs are still expensive but we spend like 7 euro between us over the course of like 3 hours - which would usually easily be ten fold if we were having alcohol. \nAt the moment we have about 3 bottles of cider and a bottle of wine in the fridge, so we have been looking forward to getting those out of the way. I thought I would be excited to come home, crack open a cider and watch some Bobs Burgers, but when we got home I wasn\u2019t mad for it really! We went through two cans of Outcider together but I had under half of one can in total I\u2019d say in total. I haven\u2019t ever been big into the taste of alcohol, so that\u2019s been helpful. It\u2019s actually been really exciting to be reluctant to drink the wine, considering I don\u2019t really like the taste, I only ever liked the effect.\nI\u2019m looking forward to having it all out of the house so that I can add my flair at last! It\u2019s been scary to think about it being a permanent, strict thing for me. I have thought about keeping it to \u201cno drinking if there is a risk of getting drunk/tipsy\u201d but I fear that that is a very fine line for me. We will see. For now however, I am definitely delighted about this achievement!",

   "selftext": "So, recently I have decided that I need to quit drinking due to medical reasons which I won't go to in this post.  Let me just say that alcohol has never really been a problem with me in the usual sense that it is for what one thinks of as an \"alcoholic\".  I have never lost a job, ruined relationships, ruined other aspects of my life as a drinker or anything of that nature.  I can go periods of time without drinking, and am able to restrain myself from drinking in excess when I absolutely need to.\n\nHowever, the main reason I am dreading the idea of quitting is the comfort alcohol provides me in social situations.  This can be at parties, receptions and events where small talk with strangers is expected and my social anxiety/introverted tendencies tend to be more heightened.  Alcohol definitely makes that more bearable and makes me more able to participate and feel engaged in the conversations that I would ordinarily not have much to contribute to or care about.\n\nIn addition, drinking is a past time that I has made it easier to make friends and interact with them throughout my adult life.  This includes college where I lived in a fraternity house for three years.  This also includes get together with old friends I don't see anymore but there is always drinking to help bring us together and make our time together more enjoyable.  Hell, without \"liquid courage\", I would have never had the courage to ask out my now wife.  \n\nWithout drinking, I just find social occasions a lot more unbearable.  I don't want to quit drinking, but as I said above, I need to for health reasons.  I wanted to know if anyone else has had similar experiences as I have had who has social anxiety, and if so, are there any strategies that you might recommend?  Thanks!",

My best friend of ten years, my cuddle buddy, my emotional support, my absolute rock in life, had developed a blood clot that caused paralysis to his back legs and excruciating pain. He had masses around his heart that suggested a defect that would cause another clot. No treatment. No cure. Within three hours, he was gone.\n\nMy husband and I are shattered. We are not well mentally, don't really have friends or a good support network, and often relied on our cat to comfort us. He slept with me every night, when my husband passed out on the couch. I can't describe to you how painful this has been. \n\nWe buried him Wednesday. My husband said he would be to bed late because he wanted to stay up and clean. This usually means get pretty drunk and clear out the trash lair a little bit. I hoped that for once he would keep his word and come to bed soon. He did not of course. He's an active alcoholic facing trauma. Of course he's going to drink, even if I need him sober. I wasn't too disappointed, I knew better than to really hope. I've been working hard on detaching. \n\nToday while preparing to clean out the litter box, I noticed a bottle of liquor on top of a tall corner cabinet in our kitchen. My husband exclusively drinks cheap beer. I got a step ladder to double check, and it's a bottle of Remy Martin fine champagne cognac. Weird. Then I notice it's got sharpie all over it. On the label it says the name of our cat and the date he died. Okay, not too surprising. Drinking is a pretty big cultural thing for my husband so I expected him to have his version of a private wake. But also . . . only about a third of the bottle is missing, and where the liquid hits, there's a black line across. Like it was being tracked or measured out. And then I notice that the top is sealed. With epoxy. He poured epoxy over the top of it so it can't be opened. \n\n\n . . . . .\n\n\nAnd then I came over to the computer to write about this because what . . . . . what??? I'm not going to ask him, probably, because detachment. Asking him about alcohol or recovery just results in lies or arguments. I'm seriously sort of bewildered right now. I know at the end of the day it doesn't matter what rituals he assigns to drinking to make himself feel better or justify it or whatever, but something about this is just so strange. I welcome any comments or possible explanations regarding his behavior. \n\nI don't welcome anyone trying to tell me I'm being dramatic over the death of my cat. He was young and it was a horrible death. Also I literally don't have any friends, so he was it. I'm feeling pretty alone right now.  ",

   "selftext": "Hey all.\n\nIt's been 12 days since I stopped, and a while since the shakes stopped. I quit cold May 6th, tried to taper it off but you can't ween down from a liter of vodka a night quick enough.\n\nI'm a small dude, 5'7\". Gained weight from the drink. Lost 4 pounds already from not drinking and walking.\n\nI started because I was like I am now. I am, and was, abjectly lonely. I had a rough childhood to put it lightly, and it left me broken socially. I am very successful financially, educated, I am told intelligent, dedicated, hardworking... But I don't have anyone. No family (foster kid), no friends. Met no one in college. I haven't felt the touch of another human for years...\n\nAnd so I started drinking, and drinking, and drinking daily from my 21st to now, being 24. I am always a happy drunk, which is why I loved it. I felt warm, released, and loved, or what I think it is to be loved. I felt complete. And the next day, when I woke up and shambled off to work, I felt miserable until I got that jump in my chest that meant it was finally time to go home and start all over again. \n\nI never thought I would be an alcoholic. But it is what it is. And I need to stop. So I did. Idk what made me think I needed to stop. Maybe I will be figuring that out with all this time I have. Been reading a lot of books on my backlog, something I couldn't do when drunk.\n\nI apologize if you got to this point and felt your time was wasted. I just wanted to reach out to someone. Maybe just to put something out there in this big empty world, make a little wave, see what comes back.\n\nThanks.",

   "selftext": "Let me start off by saying I\u2019m 14 yrs old and my sister was sent to foster care because of what I\u2019m about to get in to. The court is involved as well as cps. I\u2019m able to get into foster care but I\u2019m hesitant. If you just want to know what he did without long explanations I made a short summary below.\n\nSHORT SUMMARY.\nMy father has sexually assaulted me. He kissed me several times putting his tongue in my mouth, touched my buttocks with the intention of having sex, slapped my buttocks, and did other things like pulling my underwear up to see it. I told my mom but she doesn\u2019t want to kick him out even though my sister left to foster care because of him. I\u2019m thinking about leaving to foster care but I don\u2019t know if it will turn out okay. I love my pets, I love my mom (dispite what she\u2019s doing), I\u2019m nervous about what will happen when I\u2019m out of the system, and lastly what if foster care is worse then the situation I\u2019m in now? I\u2019m really considering leaving but these things are holding me back. Advice would be appreciated. Thank you. I\u2019ll update if I can.\n\nBelow are details to my situation. They are quite long though. And they are listed in chronological order.\n \nThe beginning.\nIt all started when I was 5 to 7 years old. My biological father inappropriately kissed me. It wasn\u2019t even a kiss. He.. made out with me. I was uncomfortable. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t tell my mom or say \u201cstop.\u201d But I just kinda backed up and away from him. This happened twice and I just thought \u201cwell this is what parents do.\u201d\n\nThe worst thing that he ever did.\nI always used to sleep in my parents bedroom because I was afraid of the dark. (I slept in their bed until I was 11. I know that\u2019s awhile) almost every other day they would have sex where I was around them. That was a poor choice in my opinion. I believe that\u2019s what caused me to begin understanding what sex was even when I was 3-4. In my parents defense they did try many times to take me out of the bedroom when I was sleeping there but I was so afraid of the dark I would go back. I never brought it up to them that I could hear them. So when I was 7 to 8 I was sleeping unlike  usual I was sleeping between my parents. My father was drunk. In his words he \u201cthought I was Mom.\u201d I woke up to him slowly placing his hand down from my lower back to my buttocks. This was the most traumatic. Because I don\u2019t know if his penis touched me or not. It was unusually smooth compared to the texture of a hand. I was so scared..I realized if I didn\u2019t act he might continue further. He was behind me so I ended up kicking him of me multiple times with a lot of force. I also made a complaining/angry sound. (Like the one you hear from a kid who doesn\u2019t get the toy they want but they don\u2019t actually scream.) he then took whatever it was out from my underwear/pants. This is what caused me to be extremely uncomfortable kissing, hugging, and sitting around him for years to come. The next morning he said \u201c*my name* I\u2019m sorry I-uhh thought you were Mom. I was- drunk.\u201d My Mom was present. She either heard me kick and complain or he told her. (I don\u2019t know if he downplayed it or not.)\n\nHe continued.\nYes I understand that parents/family from other countries do other things like for ex a mom telling her older daughter \u201cyou look so sexy in that dress!\u201d (Or lightly) \u201cthe boys are gonna be all over you!\u201d or (in some cases) hit each others butts?? (That is just weird I don\u2019t know why. Kind of like how coaches dismiss their team.) anyway I was never introduced/seen this in my family. Until.. one day. (Bear in mind I didn\u2019t know the difference between leggings and tights when I was 10-11. Stupid I know. But these particular tights were very thick winter tights for cold days with dresses. So they actually covered a lot more then you\u2019d expect.) one day I decided to wear just these tights around the house. When I came to get dinner nobody minded. Until my slightly drunk father saw me.. jokingly he made a disappointed sound like \u201cehh!\u201d And slapped my buttocks. I was taken aback by this. I literally hissed and yelled at him \u201cHEY!\u201d With an angry expression. This definitely means a hard no. He backed off and ignored it.\n\nLastly this year.\nMy sister is in foster care because she said my dad used to kiss her inappropriately. But she left mostly because of my parents alcoholism. I read the accusations. I wanted to believe \u201cmy dad was just joking around and he didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t Mom\u201d I lied to myself so much that I believed it. Till now.\nA few months ago he did it again. Not as bad but this just made me realized. This is fucked up. What happened was not a joke or mistake. He did this on purpose. One day DURNING HIS COURTCASE AGAINST MY SISTER. I was behind my mom sitting on the couch watching tv. He walked up behind me and lifted my underwear up to see it. I was shocked. I quickly turned around and shot him an angry look. I walked around to sit on the closest couch beside my mom.\n\nMy mom isn\u2019t ignorant to all this..\nOn April 19 this year I told my mom. This was 2 weeks after he looked at my underwear. I told her everything. I cried a lot. And I was worried she would not believe me. She did. She was super supportive. I trusted her... and not a day later I realized she still wants to be with him.. I brought it up one day in the car. \u201cWhat are we gonna do now? I don\u2019t want him to pick me up. He makes me super uncomfortable.\u201d My mom said \u201cI\u2019ll tell him to leave you alone. It\u2019s going to take time!\u201d I said \u201cBut Mom  it\u2019s hard to do. I feel like I\u2019m betraying *insert my sisters name* for not doing anything..\u201d my mom then said \u201c *insert my name*! It\u2019s going to take awhile!.. you can move out when you 18.\u201d I took a while to get it out. \u201cWhat do you mean 18.. I can\u2019t wait that long. I can\u2019t stay like this! I told you because I don\u2019t want to go to fostercare!\u201d My Mom: \u201cWHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO. I HAVE A JOB. YOUR FATHER HAS EVERYTHING UNDER HIS NAME.\u201d Me: \u201cHOW LONG IS IT GOING TO TAKE? I CAN\u2019T WAIT ANY LONGER. I FEEL UNSAFE AROUND HIM. HE DROVE AWAY *my sister* AND *my brother* DO YOU CARE?\u201d My mom \u201cthen what.. WHAT DO WE DO. If they know he\u2019s going to jail!\u201d Me \u201cthen I won\u2019t say anything! Why can\u2019t you just tell him to move out! We can\u2019t just have him here!\u201d My mom \u201cHE WILL BECOME HOMELESS.\u201d Me \u201cYOU\u2019RE ASKING ME TO WAIT 4 YEARS TO BECOME COMFORTABLE? I FEEL LIKE YOU DONT CARE. CAN JUST GO TO FOSTER CARE AND WAIT UNTIL HE MOVES OUT AND EVERYTHING IS SOLVED.\u201d My Mom \u201cthen what are you supposed to tell cps huh?\u201d Me \u201cMom.. I can\u2019t wait anymore I don\u2019t think it can last two more weeks.\u201d My mom \u201cokay. I\u2019ll tell him to move out on Sunday. OKAY. Don\u2019t push me! I only learned yesterday!\u201d It didn\u2019t happen.. then a week later she told my dad and we all \u2018talked\u2019. He denied everything. He pitied himself. He mocked me jokingly.\n\nMy mom now is on his side. Here\u2019s her excuses.\nI talked to my mom 1 week ago. She convinced me that \u201cwhen you leave foster care at 18 then what? They [refering to my sisters foster parents] won\u2019t help you! Their job IS DONE.\u201d I\u2019m scared that when I leave I won\u2019t know what to do. She also said \u201che said it was a mistake. He comes from a different country.\u201d I told her \u201cparents don\u2019t do that. No country EVER treats their kids this way\u201d my mom also said \u201cIt happened a long time ago. You may remember it differently.\u201d I said \u201cI remember it clearly. I always told myself it was normal but it\u2019s not.\u201d My Mom \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell him no?\u201d Me \u201cI didn\u2019t say no because my actions clearly showed that his actions made me unhappy.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going on now?\nI\u2019m still with my parents. My dad hasn\u2019t left. I try bringing it up but my mom either changes the subject constantly, gets irritated and defends my dad, or shakes her head and leaves. The only change is that I try to avoid my dad as much as possible and respond to him only if I feel like there\u2019s no other choice. I also keep my responses short. He tries to interact with me even though I only respond coldly. But I feel it\u2019s important to say the only things keeping me back from leaving is my pets (they are my family I love them.), my mom (I love my mom. When I\u2019m around her she feels like how a parent should be like. Loving, caring, funny, supportive, etc. I really up til this point feel like she has been what a parent should be.), my future (I feel like when I\u2019m out of foster care. There\u2019s nobody who\u2019s gonna support me.), the people (will the people be better or worse), school and friends, (my friends treat me like family. They are just amazing human beings with big hearts.), my other family (great people. especially my grandfather who I just met. My grandma.. she\u2019s a wonderful person. My other grandmother is also amazing.)",

   "selftext": "It\u2019s been recommended I come here a few times so I thought I\u2019d give it a shot. I\u2019m writing about my relationship with my husband. It sounds like here you would call him my \u201cqualifier.\u201d We have been together 5 years. When we were first together I noticed that he drank some wine every night-maybe a bottle. While I\u2019ve dealt with my own addiction issues in the past, but have been sober for the vast majority of the last 10 years, I\u2019ve never really been a drinker and no one in my family drinks much, so I feel like I don\u2019t have a concept of what is a normal amount/frequency to drink. I know a lot of people drink a bit every day and are just fine- not alcoholics, no life destroying problems. So while I didn\u2019t see any problems with my husband\u2019s drinking at first, over time it\u2019s become apparent that he has a problem. About 3 years ago my husband started bringing wine with him to work (as a lawyer) and I noticed he was drinking in the morning and more after work. It was concerning. Almost 2 years ago he quit his job and we moved so that he could focus on trying to be a writer. It was supposed to make him happy, but he seems miserable most of the time. \n\nHe is now drinking from the moment he wakes up until when he goes to bed or passes out. He has only come to bed with me maybe 10-15 times total in the last 2 years. It\u2019s lonely. He stays up drinking and writing and doing coke. He drinks about 4 bottles of wine a day. I never know or can tell when or if he\u2019s drunk or sober or just buzzed. He sleeps so little I think it\u2019s possible he is never actually sober. He is angry a lot of the time. He says the meanest things to me and then acts like he doesn\u2019t even remember saying it (and maybe he doesn\u2019t). He doesn\u2019t work (a real job in which he makes money). He doesn\u2019t pick up around the house. He barely takes our dog out when I\u2019m at work during the day. She still has to use a potty pad at 11 months old. \n\nHe has passed out and fallen while standing up multiple times, sustaining likely concussions, and the last time he gashed his head open and was unconscious for 5 minutes while I tried to stop the bleeding. Aside from these incidents, which he blames on blood sugar fluctuations (he\u2019s also a type 1 diabetic), he hasn\u2019t suffered any consequences. Given that I support us financially, he doesn\u2019t drive so he won\u2019t get a DUI, he denies that drinking affects his diabetes (when his doctors have told him it does), etc. I don\u2019t see how he hits rock bottom.  I know I had to suffer some major consequences before I had the will and desire to stop using. I worry about him all the time. I know I enable him by supporting him and his habits financially. He\u2019s not a child so it\u2019s hard to say \u201cno you can\u2019t do that\u201d or \u201cno I won\u2019t pay for that.\u201d That\u2019s not how a marriage works. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m asking but I don\u2019t know how to handle this. I\u2019m not his keeper but I care about him and want to help and keep him safe. I feel like I\u2019m watching him kill himself slowly every day. I want to try and go to an alanon meeting but he would freak if he found out. He doesn\u2019t think he has a problem. Any thoughts or suggestions are welcome. Thank you for taking the time to read this if you got this far. ",

He mocked me jokingly.\n\nMy mom now is on his side. Here\u2019s her excuses.\nI talked to my mom 1 week ago. She convinced me that \u201cwhen you leave foster care at 18 then what? They [refering to my sisters foster parents] won\u2019t help you! Their job IS DONE.\u201d I\u2019m scared that when I leave I won\u2019t know what to do. She also said \u201che said it was a mistake. He comes from a different country.\u201d I told her \u201cparents don\u2019t do that. No country EVER treats their kids this way\u201d my mom also said \u201cIt happened a long time ago. You may remember it differently.\u201d I said \u201cI remember it clearly. I always told myself it was normal but it\u2019s not.\u201d My Mom \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell him no?\u201d Me \u201cI didn\u2019t say no because my actions clearly showed that his actions made me unhappy.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going on now?\nI\u2019m still with my parents. My dad hasn\u2019t left. I try bringing it up but my mom either changes the subject constantly, gets irritated and defends my dad, or shakes her head and leaves. The only change is that I try to avoid my dad as much as possible and respond to him only if I feel like there\u2019s no other choice. I also keep my responses short. He tries to interact with me even though I only respond coldly. But I feel it\u2019s important to say the only things keeping me back from leaving is my pets (they are my family I love them.), my mom (I love my mom. When I\u2019m around her she feels like how a parent should be like. Loving, caring, funny, supportive, etc. I really up til this point feel like she has been what a parent should be.), my future (I feel like when I\u2019m out of foster care. There\u2019s nobody who\u2019s gonna support me.), the people (will the people be better or worse), school and friends, (my friends treat me like family. They are just amazing human beings with big hearts.), my other family (great people. especially my grandfather who I just met. My grandma.. she\u2019s a wonderful person. My other grandmother is also amazing.)\n\nUPDATES:\nmy sister contacted my social worker and she will get back to me on Wednesday as she is taking a vacation. I chose 2 people who may be able to foster me. One friend is  asking her mom. Wish me luck guys. &lt;3\n\nI\u2019m currently in a foster home with my sister. They\u2019re super nice people I\u2019ve been here for about a week.",

   "selftext": "I'm running out of places to turn these days. I've tried therapy, medications, and everything else out there, but none of it has worked. I've never tried using this before for help, but I figured I would give it a try. Maybe the concept of being able to interact with people that have been there before will help. \n\nI've been severely depressed for about 6 years now. It's been an up-and-down experience with many lows, and I'm at one of those low points again. I just feel like a complete shell of the person I used to be. It's been so long that I kind of forget who that person even was. There are a lot of awful memories that I think are contributing to this that I need to get out of my system, so I just kind of need to vent those out. Maybe it'll help. \n\nWhen it started 6 years ago, it was when I started to feel the side effects of brain injuries I had playing football. I had 5 concussions in a 4 year span, and it wasn't until college that I started feeling the side effects of it all. Constant headaches, memory loss, severe mood swings - it's been horrible. Simple autonomous actions have now become a chore at times. The headaches and mood swings have prevented me from doing the things I used to love. The memory loss has been the worst of it all though. This past year, I completely forgot when my own birthday was. A few months ago, I was on a vacation with a few friends, and woke up one morning and completely forgot where I was. I laid in bed for and hour panicking, not knowing what to do. I've always been reading reports on the effects of CTE - and the amount of times it has driven someone to committ suicide - and what it does to people, and I'm scared shitless that I'm going to end up like that one day. \n\nThen the sexual problems began happening. During college, I was drugged and raped by a person who I considered to be a friend. It was the worst experience of my life. I woke up completely naked, handcuffed by my ankles and wrists to bedposts. I was blindfolded and gagged, burned with cigarettes, hit in the face repeatedly, beaten with paddles and belts, clawed at with fingernails, forced to have sex multiple times...I was tied up for close to 6 hours. The worst part of it all was the entire thing was photographed - she had a Polaroid camera and was taking pictures of everything as she did it all. After it was all over and I was finally unbound, I found all of the pictures she took. It was mortifying to look at. The worst one of them all was a bird's eye view of me completely naked and tied up, blindfolded and gagged, bruises everywhere. I took the picture and burned it when I finally got home, thinking it would help, telling myself I would never let someone do that to me ever again, but it only got worse. \n\nI never wish something like that happening to anyone, ever, regardless of who you are and what you've been through. Being a male and having something like that happen to you is such a difficult experience. Trying to talk to people about it is the worst. I tried to be open with a few people about It - some of them just laughed at my \"submissiveness\", others told me to just \"man up and stop being a pussy\".  I didn't know what to do about it or who to go to for help because no one could. I couldn't sleep for months. The nightmares were regular, reliving it all as it happened over and over again. I tried drinking it away, but just ended up turning into an alcoholic. The alcohol didn't mix well with the medication either. One night, right when my senior year started, I got really drunk, snapped, and tried to kill myself because I couldn't deal with it anymore. Almost jumped to my death, but I stopped last minute and pulled myself back. \n\nI was a mess. I turned into a complete shut-in, blocked everyone out of my life, nearly failed out of school as I kept drinking my life away.  After about a month or so of feeling sorry for myself, I finally sobered up and worked towards getting my life together. Stopped the drinking, stopped the medication, started taking better care of myself. It paid off though. I graduated on time (by the skin on my teeth), managed to get a job after graduation, and moved out to bumblefuck to start my life on my own. I finally thought I was turning a corner in my life. Thinking that an opportunity to be on my own and find myself again would be the thing that would help the most.\n\nUntil I realized I was more alone out there than ever before. I've never been one to be good at making friends on my own, so there were a lot of days of doing nothing and talking to no one; just working, coming home, smoking weed and playing Xbox, going to bed, and repeating. It was like living in a shitty version of Groundhog Day except there were no other cast members, only me. That's when the depression started coming back again.  I felt agitated by anything and everything. I would go days without eating or talking to anyone. The drinking got really bad again. There were days at work where I would have mental breakdowns and have to leave the office for hours to regain my composure. So I decided to try a therapist again. I don't know if it was just the therapist I was going to or what, but it wasn't helping at all. I just felt like it was going in circles and talking for the sake of talking. \n\nDespite it all, I made an effort to try and put myself out there and get back into the dating world, thinking it would help to have someone to be close to. I met this one girl at a wedding. She was awesome. Spending time with her was the most fun I've had in years. I was so proud of myself for getting back out there and having it pay off. After the wedding we continued to talk, and eventually I went to visit her on my own. Spent the weekend with her, took her out to dinner, had an absolute blast. For the first time in a really long time, I was really happy. After the weekend I left and went back home, kept talking to her after the fact, thinking things were going great. Until shit started to hit the fan again. \n\nA few days after I left her place, she went and accused me of raping her. It was a Thursday while I was at work when she texted me about it, completely laying into me. I was in a meeting when it happened, I remember having to get up out of the meeting because it completely sucked all of the life out of me and I couldn't focus. I didn't know what to do. The instant I got the text, it kept triggering the memories of when it happened to me, and I couldnt bear to live with the fact that I made someone else feel the way that I felt that one night. As I left work, I stopped at a gun store on my way home and bought a pistol, thinking it would finally be over soon enough. \n\nWhen morning finally came around, I couldn't bear it anymore and tried to shoot myself, but the gun jammed in my hand when I tried. I cried hysterically for hours, just sitting there not knowing what to do. After I was able to get the bullet out of the gun, I put it down on my table, and just laid there on my couch staring at it, thinking about how it had failed me, how I had failed myself. I didn't move for 4 straight days, just laying there. Eventually, I composed myself enough to call her and tell her about what happened, to try and apologize. Only to find out that the accusations were false ones. I was devastated. I didn't know what to think. Why would someone go so far out of their way to ruin someone's life like that? All I ever wanted was for her to feel happy and safe, and she went and did that? How? Why? I kept trying to talk to her and understand why she went and did that, but she blocked my number and all communications with me.\n\nBeing on my own in the middle of nowhere, I didn't know who to talk to. I was so alone, scared of being out there solo out of fear of what I would do to myself next. After I sobered up, I decided to make the day-long drive across the country to be back with my family and friends. It was a sobering experience being home and finally opening up to some people about what happened. To finally have a supporting cast to help get me through it. I came to the realization that I needed to be around these people in my life. After a week of being home, I drove back out to bumblefuck, quit my job out there, and moved back home to try and find a job there and be close to my supporting cast thinking it would help. \n\nA few months later here I am, feeling like I'm falling into that same dark place yet again as I sit here at 2 AM in my parent's basement unable to sleep. Unemployed, lonely, depressed, losing friends, losing sleep, dealing with the headaches and everything else, contemplating whether or not it worth it to keep falling back into this trap and pull myself out over and over again. I'm really scared. I'm so fucking scared and I don't know what to do.",

It was quiet for all of two hours when I could actually get some sleep. \n\nThese people have lived beside me for nearly 5 years now. I don't know how I've stuck it for so long. Things have been especially bad in recent weeks though as the teenage son of the alcoholic/asshole mother now smokes very strong cannabis. As do his friends. And it's illegal here in the UK. So they smoke this crap a lot and the smell wafts right into my house. It contaminates the clothes that are hanging outside to dry. It wafts in through the windows and stinks the place out. It's ridiculous. These people are unapproachable as I've had run\\-ins with them before, due to nuisance noise. I dared to complain to them one night last year at 4am because of the disruption and I got called some disgusting things in return. They simply do not care. Calling the police in the past has been useless as after they leave, I get more abuse. \n\nNow a friend of theirs recently got out of prison for attempted murder and keeps hanging around their house. He scares me. So it's bad. I'm due to see a local councillor with another pissed off neighbour to make a formal complaint and hopefully get the ball rolling to get them evicted. We are housing executive tenants and they are private renting. The housing exec can't do anything because of this. It's frustrating to say the least. Just for once I hope things go our way. I house\\-share with my dad who's in his late 60s and is struggling to cope with this also. He's lived in this house for 45 years, and I for most of my 38. \n\nI just absolutely hate these people for what they're putting us through. The lack of sleep, the harassment, intimidation et al. We just want it to stop. ",

Probably under the legal limit, but still.  I don't know though, I don't feel that bad about it.  I guess, now that I'm reflecting on it I think it was a bad choice.  I kind of feel like, \"I didn't even get drunk.  It's not like I did anything wrong.\"  But I also feel like it's a gateway that will lead me right back to drinking a bottle of whiskey a night.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this?  I don't plan on drinking tomorrow or in the near future, but I am only 3 weeks sober from having drunk a 1/2  bottle to a bottle a night for about 3 years.  Am I lying to myself thinking that this isn't a big deal?\n\nEdit: The worst part is, right before I went to bed I looked in my bathroom mirror and, for the first time since  I stopped drinking I really looked at myself, and I almost didn't recognize myself.  I have had a puffy face for years and tonight I actually looked totally different.  No puffiness, no redness.  I looked pretty great.  I can't stress how much of a change it was.  And it made me sad that I made a mistake by drinking.  It made me realize I need to keep up being sober because I am actually seeing results.  Maybe cutting ~1500 cal. out of my day will make me lose some weight as well.",

It was like I was thrown in a river the moment I was born and with every year I was abused as a child and  with every trauma I suffered, that river got swifter and more treacherous, always leading towards a huge waterfall that spilled into an abyss.\n\nBecause I was born to a \"broken\" mother, \\(she was schizophrenic and chose to self medicate with alcohol\\), who married a Vietnam veteran with PTSD who also self medicated with alcohol, I didn't learn to swim nor was I given a boat or a life raft.....I had to dog paddle, half drowning,  taking on gulps of water along the way.\n\nBy the time I was in my mid 30's, I was diagnosed for the first time as bipolar, suffering from PTSD from my childhood abuse and that stemming from my first marriage, and was self medicating with alcohol. By the time I was in my 40's,  I was diagnosed with epilepsy. I was a danger to myself: someone who refused to treat ANY of their physical or mental illnesses.\n\nI will not go into the destruction of my life for it is a common theme for folks who suffer from mental illness and alcoholism as a result of self medicating said mental illnesses.  190 days ago I stopped that barreling down the river towards the abyss and reached out for the shore.

Well, since I went on my hiatus, this particular friend hasn't been very accepting or nice about it. Reading between the lines, I believe he's unhappy he's lost a main drinking partner.

Well, since I quit drinking, he doesn't even invite me out anymore. I invited myself to the bar after work and had some coffee and soda water, and he spoke appreciation for the gesture, but almost seemed annoyed.

I would wake up feeling like shit and regret would seep from my pores as I struggled to recover, mostly from self-loathing.\n Formerly, I didn't know how to explain to my alcoholic friends that they were aiding in hurting my relationship, and that we could still have fun hanging out during the day, alcohol-free, and help me avoid the unpleasantries of justifying my behavior to my partner.

I smoked daily back when I was 18 to 20 years old.  I thought I was doing great.  My grades in school were excellent.  My drinking wasn't out of control yet.  Yet suddenly out of what seemed to be nowhere I started experiencing uncued panic attacks.  At the time I assumed it was solely due to stress as my grandfather died and my dad suffered a heart attack a couple of months apart and I just couldn't deal.  I accidentally just started smoking less, but I have been smoking on and off since then.  Occasionally I would get a panic attack while high, but I thought I was just being weak or overdramatic.\n\nAt the current moment, I have noticed myself having problems with derealization, constant spiraling negative thoughts, panic attacks, and just generally poor mental health.  Once again I was about to blame it on the stress of moving, getting a new job, learning a new language, and my whole life being turned upside down.  But then I took a minute and though about it: I had actually experienced way MORE stress in the last couple of years before moving.  I had to deal with my dad dying, helping my mom get her life back together, and changing jobs and locations repeatedly.  And I handled it spectacularly and rarely felt anxious, even if I argued with my mom, even if everything looked bleak.  At that time, I was not drinking or smoking or engaging in hardly any unhealthy behaviors whatsoever except maybe having weird sleep patterns due to working at night.  Now, yeah I am kinda stressed, but no one died and my life is pretty on track.  Yet I feel like I am losing my mind.  The only difference is now I vape sometimes and I had been vaping for the last few months.  It has to be the combination of both weed and stress that makes me start to experience psychotic symptoms.\n\nI haven't vaped in about 2 weeks now.  The final straw was when I went on a camping trip and didn't enjoy it.  I love nature, and I was in a beautiful place, and it still sucked.  I made the mistake of smoking while hiking to the campsite, and I couldn't stop worrying the whole time \\(granted I did have some valid reason to worry, we were lost, but I shouldn't have been THAT worried\\).  Then I vaped at the campsite, and instead of being able to relax and enjoy it, I started spacing out so I didn't even feel like I was in that beautiful place and worrying again about if some wild boar would come out of the forest and kill me.  What should have been a relaxing weekend just turned into a bunch of stress.  I hated it so much I wished I was at work the whole time because that would have been more pleasureable.  No thanks.\n\nAnyway, thanks for listening to my story.  I hope I can help be supportive to you all on your mission to quit smoking/vaping/dabbing.",

   "selftext": "I don\u2019t know exactly when I started to feel this way but I know it\u2019s been a feeling that feels like I have forever. \n\nMy mom was, and still is, an alcoholic growing up. She left after my dad finally forced her out when I was about 10. My dads no good either honestly though, he is very emotionally detached and isn\u2019t that caring of an individual. He\u2019d rather sit in front of his computer or TV and spend hours binge watching that instead of interacting with me. \n\nI have two siblings, and my dad seemed to always favor them over me. We would constantly get into fights, and he would call me lazy and fat and a slob. Granted my room is and was always dirty, I\u2019m so depressed all the time that I have no energy to keep it clean. \n\nI told me sister I had wanted to kill myself at around age 5, she warned my parents and they did nothing. I was bullied all the way up until highschool, freshman year, and because of this I was emotionally and mentally stunted in learning and social skills. It wasn\u2019t until 7th grade that I learned basic multiplication skills on my own. \n\nTowards the middle of high school was the worst period for me, me and my dad fought probably weekly and I was practically living with my boyfriend at the time. It was about that time that I was sent to the mental hospital because of my severe depression, I had tried to take my life. It obviously didn\u2019t work and I was brought there.\n\nIt was one of the worst experiences of my life. All the other patients had anger issues, I felt very out of place and as if I was punished for feeling a certain way. I was never seen by a therapist, and I remember just sleeping the entire day feeling like I was crazy and wanting to kill myself even more. \n\nOnce I got out nothing got better, my and my boyfriend ended up splitting up because of my best friend meddling in our relationship with things I confided to her confidentiality. Mostly my insecurities because he wasn\u2019t as loving as I had hoped, and he confessed that he was thinking about cheating on me with one of my close friends. My best friend and my ex ended up getting together (shocker), and since I was so desperate to cling onto any type of normalcy I was following my ex around like a puppy, not knowing what to do. This ended up with they bullying me for the remainder of my high school career, and I got suspended multiple times for finally retaliating against their abuse. \n\nEver since I was 16 and had a job my dad tried to provide nothing but the bare minimum. Bread, eggs, and milk. I have 1 pair of leggings and I wear them all the time, having to stitch them up when they rip because I cannot afford new ones. Hygiene products and makeup were also my responsibility. \n\nOnce I got out nothing got better, I\u2019ve so far ended up with three jobs that treated me like shit, making me cry in their stores in front of customers. My last was the most heartbreaking, as I was working for Petsmart and cared deeply about the animals. \n\nThis company does not, they treated them very poorly, and neglected them when they could. I remember bringing so much stuff for the animals, making sure none of them were sick and caring for their every need. My coworkers didn\u2019t care as much, and neither did my boss. Eventually when we lost over 3 grand in fish they tried to blame it on me, leading to me quitting (the filter broke and I warned them not to leave them overnight, the cold water would kill them. They didn\u2019t listen). I eventually left that job with a very socially inept parrot, that I couldn\u2019t bare leaving for an incompetent customer to purchase. She is still with me and her and my pet chinchilla are the reasons why I don\u2019t just off myself, knowing that no one would take care of them. \n\nDuring my time there my very old car had broke down. My dad convinced me that I shouldn\u2019t put money into it and that I should purchase his truck instead. I gave him 3,000 in bonds (that was supposed to go towards colllege). It was very nice, when I got it. I realized that my dad didn\u2019t drive it too often, and once I started driving, it broke down. Now it needs around 2 grand in repairs, and I get paid 12$ an hour at a job I hate. The gas on the car weekly is around 60$. Usually a day I make around 150 calls, and routinely get yelled at by my boss over petty things. \n\nRecently I had to go to the dentist and get my teeth looked at, I was having severe pain in my tooth, which seemed like I cracked it. I have a severe cavity, another to go, and she hasn\u2019t even looked at my other side of my mouth. About 250$ a tooth. Not including expenses on my animals. \n\nI\u2019ve lost so many people in the past few months. My godmother passed recently and unexpectedly. I have her name as my middle name. She would without a doubt send multiple cards in the mail every holiday and like the utter piece of shit that I am I never responded to any of them. I was so caught up that I didn\u2019t appreciate her, and it\u2019s one of my biggest regrets. My uncle passed away this past March due to ALS, he has a hyper aggressive strain that took him with a year. He was big and burly and within a couple of months he became a withering old man. I never had the time to connect with him, and I also regret this. My grandma, my last living grand parent, has a slow acting form of lung cancer and is dying slowly before me, and my best friend almost passed due to an over dose. She no longer speaks to me since I forced her into the ER due to her overdosing and being suicidal. \n\nI never have any interest in anything, the only things that give me joy are driving and smoking cigarettes. Which isn\u2019t viable because my car is so broken. It\u2019s hard most days to get out of bed, meaning I\u2019m late almost all the time; another reason for my boss to yell. \n\nI don\u2019t really have many friends. I have a very hard time trusting people, and becoming too attached when I do get a friend. So I tend to keep my distance.\n\nI would like to be a regular teen, going to college and enjoying my life but I can\u2019t do any of that. I\u2019m also broke, and paying for things this postponing my education. All of my class mates have left for college, leaving me here to work and slave away at a job I hate. I\u2019ve gained so much weight and just feel like killing myself almost all the time. I don\u2019t know what to do at this point. I can\u2019t do this anymore mentally or physically. I\u2019m desperate for affection, care, and understanding but I seem to be unlovable.\n\nEdit: This afternoon I got my truck back, and they somehow broke it even more. So it does get worse I suppose.

   "selftext": "So I met my boyfriend 2 years ago, I liked to drink and party as well so that's what we would do up until he started selling drugs and getting drunk constantly, started saying horrible things while drunk, destroyed my moms basement, etc. I decided to leave him as I didnt want that kind of lifestyle and to be around drugs. 5 months later he got a job and we got back together, still drinking. Things were good at first until he started getting more aggressive. He was arrested for apparently throwing me around outside a 7/11, we were both blacked out dont remember anything. He also resisted arrest and hit a police officer. Basically after that he would get really drunk and say horrible mean things to me and push me around, throw my stuff around. I try tell him the next day he gets angry and tells at me. Jump to now, I've got control on my drinking, I'm going to college, im seeing mental health to better myself and he still drinks every couple days and is mean to me, very mean. The things he says are horrible and hurt my self esteem.. he had a knife in his hand last night and threatened to hurt him self if I leave. I'm only 20, hes 26.. this isn't the life I want for myself and I'm tired of having to take responsibility in the relationship, and I'm tired of getting treated so poorly. I'm afraid one day he will get violent again, even though it's just pushing I hate it and his drinking is driving me crazy. How do I leave someone so dependent on me? He says all hes gonna do is drink his life away, or he'd have nothing without me if I leave him and I have too big of a heart to let someone else hurt... please help me. ",

What\u2019s so wrong with feeling good? It\u2019s not like I was doing anything to hurt others while on pills. In fact, everyone liked me better on them.

She said my germaphobia is out of control, as I saw ants crawling on the thing the fork was on, and I told her I didn't want to eat using the fork that she had on the dirty counter (which was full of weird..stains that..its hard to explain the stains.. but they stick up..) and there were ants crawling on it and my mom threw the ants away.\n\nShe's mad that I didn't eat with the fork she had set on the counter full of dirty stains and a wet paper towel she was using to wipe it off and there's ants crawling all over it,\n\nand then she talked to me in the other room and I walked in and she was still talking, and I told her what I tell her every time of \"my health teacher told me not to talk over the food cuz then you might spit in it while talking accidentally\" and my mom said \"NOTHING!!!!\" and I said what did you say? and she angerly said \"NOTHING\"\n\nand now the thing is gonna happen again where my dad calls and she tells him that I was being a pain and then my dad gets home at 11:30pm and assumes it was because I was drinking (I had no beer at all today, I had literally two beers yesterday) and every time I talk to my psychologist about anything, he just wants to link everything I say to my dad being worried about me being an alcoholic (which it ends up He just doesn't want to pay money for me to get beer.  He always looks and glares for the cheapest stuff at price chopper and he gets really angry if I drink more than one beer at the bar cuz he says it costs a lot and he only gets me a 12 pack once every friday, in exchange for something I can't mention here.)\n\nand someone on Reddit messaged me 23 hours ago asking me for.. idk if I'm allowed to say it.. but nsfw lewd pics and his posts are all serious so I guess people are just trying to troll me on here\n\nAlso I keep worrying because someone said about me: \"I was basing it off of his use of language, phrasing, past posts, and the fact that anime and videogames seemed to play a large part in his life. Most ppl who were into anim and videogames as teens aren't still obsessed with it at 30. Just my opinion though. Not saying there is anything wrong with it but i'd say its not the norm.\"\n\nWHY is it so bad that I like anime and video games\n\nWhy do people think I'm obsessed with video games and anime!!?!?!\n\nI never beat a Final Fantasy game before, I never beat a Zelda game before, I never beat Chrono Trigger or Chrono Cross before, I literally have not beaten a video game in the past (I'm bad with time so I probably shouldn't guess how many years) years, except for a few Kingdom Hearts games (I'm in the middle of playing Kingdom Hearts 2 for the first time.)\n\nI'm not that obsessed with anime.. ok I guess I am... well I am.. cuz someone on reddit said I am so I must be..  But I mean..  I only watch anime that were on Toonami, and mainstream stuff that people online talk about, like Mob Psycho 100 and Osomatsu-san and Gintama.\n\nAnd my bro yesterday I HAD SO MUCH ANXIETY.  He kept walking past me grunting and he always says stuff REALLY REALLY quietly especially when he says negative stuff, and I think he kept saying \"I'm ignoring you [my name] because I'm acting ridiculous\"\n\nall I did was tell my mom that everyone on this message board talked about a new OVA to Mob Psycho 100 so I wanted to show the family more Mob Psycho 100.\n\nI watched the third dubbed episode of Mob Psycho 100 and my mom said \"That opening took way too long\" and I got covered in sweat and tried to tell her that on the message board I go to, someone said in the thread about the newest OVA, that they were happy to hear the opening song, so people on the internet do like the opening song and I like it too and I just wanted to hear it after reading that on the message board I go to.\n\nMY GOSH every time I watch anime with the family\n\nlike it goes so slow and my bro keeps looking down at his phone, literally missing the best looking scenes, then taking a very quick glance afterwards at a not-as-good-looking scene and then forces out awkward compliments.\n\nAnd then in the car, he said the song that's playing is \"Daft Punk is playing at my house\" or whatever, and I looked at him (cuz I was thinking in my head \"He isn't really saying that, right...?  HE ALREADY told me about this song before but he thinks I'm so dumb that I don't remember) and he asked if I knew who Daft Punk was and he said he's the one that made the anime music videos he directly said.\n\nI was the one that gave him the Intersteller 5555 DVD for his birthday or christmas or something years ago.  I know what Daft Punk is!  I imagine stuff about my \"Hamster Rivals\"/\"Ham Ham Rivals\" series to a Daft Song remix.\n\nIts like when my bro's ex-girlfriend said \"Hey [my name] I'm getting my hair colored Magenta (or some other color, I forget, this was a few years ago when his ex-girlfriend was here) and she showed me the color on her phone.  But I know what color that is!\n\nOne time, my bro's ex-girlfriend, the one who once came down in the basement holding an almost empty bottle of liquor and told me \"In your brothers eyes and mine, we see you as younger and more immature than even your 3 year old niece.\"\n\nwell the first week she stayed at this house (before she left it like 3 years ago, so this was like 7 years ago) she said \"I'm going to bed at 11:30pm, [my name], like a NORMAL person, because I'm the only person that lives in REALITY in this house.\" and then she laughed at me (like the time when my bro and his ex-girlfriend went in the car, and she joked about me \"doing nothing at my house\" and she laughed before they both drove away to meet their friends.)\n\nand anyways I especially wanted to say my mom keeps sniffing her nose.  I know she only does it cuz every time she keeps doing it I ask if she wants a tissue and she was probably trying to harass me.  Then she blew her nose and I thought \"ok I can play Kingdom Hearts 2 in peace\" but then she sniffed her nose AGAIN later on.\n\nI'm a really shy nerd that doesn't speak up irl at all and I have no friends irl literally at all (one time I hung out with my bro's ex-girlfirend and my bro and his friends at a campfire, and when we came back, my bro's ex-girlfriend said \"I HOPE YOU REALIZE [my name] that you were making everyone feel incredibly awkward and nervous the whole time.\" I did not say a word at the campfire though (besides maybe saying hi whats up to the people there at first.)\n\nMy bro had me hang out with him and his current girlfriend recently, like 3 years ago, and his friend asked \"What's wrong with him?  Did his mom just die or something??\" about me.  My bro lied and said I was drunk or something (I didn't drink at all) to them.\n\nand now I'm online and I hope people will remember me when I die from my old Pok\u00e9mon fangames that I made back in 6th grade and my other old fangames and that people will finally play my old fangames that I always wish someone would play (I was gonna link to a wikia page I made that talks about all of the old fangames I made and has screenshots and stuff, but then I worry about this thread getting deleted for advertising or something)\n\nanyways idk what to do, I'm just here and my body physically hurts cuz I keep hearing my mom downstairs and I'm worried she'll make me look bad to my dad again, and ANY time I complain to my Psychologist, he just says \"Well your dad [who drinks over 3 cups of scotch every day btw] was worried about you being an alcoholic and I myself get loopy after just 3 beers, I wouldn't be able to ever have more than 3 beers, drinking a beer kills your brain cells, and the reason why you're frustrated about your mom being noisy is because 4 days ago you drank beer and you can still feel irritable from drinking beer for the days afterward\" but I only drink beers on friday and saturday (again I didn't drink any beer yet today, though.)\n\nand anyways aah idk how to end what I say sometimes.\n\nAH I JUST heard my mom make a weird moan noise now.  I guess she was yawning.  Wait no now I hear her walking around.\n\nI WOULD NOT CARE at all about hearing her walk around\n\nOH... SSSSSSSS I JUST HEARD HER MAKE THAT NOISE AGAIN that sounds like a yawn.\n\nIt reminds me of when she'd say I can lay down next to her in her bed, but she'd keep moving her legs around and making weird noises\n\nSHE KEEPS MAKING WEIRD NOISES AND WALKING AROUND\n\nok so I was gonna say\n\nARGH NOW I HEARD HER SLAM THE FRIDGE DOOR CLOSE\n\nARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI WOULD NOT CARE AT ALL\n\n....DUDE I SERIOUSLY JUST HEARD IT AGAIN\n\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH\n\nAERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH\n\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH  I CAN'T STAND IT RIGHT NOW now I'm covered in sweat AAAAAAAAAAAAARGH DUDE NOW I'M HEARING HER WALK AROUND\n\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH\n\nrainbow dots are spinning around in my vision right now\n\nI WISH IT WOULD STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI never even cared at all, but my mom and dad kept complaining whenever I go up and down the stairs into different rooms to different things, they keep asking what I\"m doing and then they keep commenting over and over that \"I must be wondering around because I'm bored and have nothing better to do\" like I have no life, when I DID have a reason to go to the rooms I was going to.\n\nThen they complained once about me \"walking too loud in the kitchen.\"\n\nso whenever I hear my mom walking around downstairs in the kitchen, a part of me REALLY WONDERS REALLY REALLY HARD if she is trying as hard as possible to walk on the floor to make noise just to be a hyprocrit cuz I get in trouble if they hear me walking around in the kitchen, but she always does it and it sounds like she has boots on or something.\n\nAnd you know...whats...um also bad...  My dad..once played a video on his phone last weekend during Toonami and talked during it once and\n\nLITERALLY I WOULD NOT CARE AT ALL\n\nbut whenever I came downstairs during Fun Friday to tell my mom that they're playing really cool Japanese anime music and video game music in The Weeabootique micspam server I'm playing on, my dad (while drinking his scotch) ALWAYS pauses the movie he's playing,\n\nand dude MY DAD REALLY GETS FRUSTERATED any time I tell my mom ANYTHING during the movie.  He pauses it and keeps looking at me and asking what is it and saying I'm being a bother and he threatens me telling me to just Go to bed.\n\nThe only show I care about watching is Toonami\n\nI never ever cared about if they talk or watch videos or play music while I watch it,\n\nbut whenever I tell my mom something simple during a movie, my dad seriously gets super extremly annoyed and pauses the movie and yells \"WHAT!?!?!?!?  WHAT IS IT.  You're interrupting us.  You're interrupting the movie.  We just want to watch this movie (or netflix series or whatever.)\"  But whenever Toonami is on, my dad just sits in the recliner with his scotch and stares at his phone playing music videos on it extremely loudly.\n\nAnd lately whenever he asks something, I answer and I try to answer loud cuz he's kinda deaf, and then he says \"DID YOU HEAR ME!?!?\" getting mad cuz I didn't answer loud enough.  But once, I told him to please take better care of the PS4 controllers her uses for netflix, since the holes were all clogged and gross and the touchpads don't work on any of them anymore, and he just looked at me and then looked back, not saying a single word.  There's other times he did that too, but I forget the examples.\n\n=(",

   "selftext": "Well, hmm... it is hard to even know how to start this.\n\nSince my last post where I lost my job and ended up detoxing in a motel room with my dog I had a little over two months sober. Being that I didn't have a job and had been looking I planned to go visit my mom over a weekend while I waited on prospects to come around. I have always wanted to live near mountains and got into a tiff with my GF of 4 years about her not wanting to move as I had a job offer waiting for me in North Carolina.\n\nI said from the git-go I was not a city person and only wanted to be in Chicago one, or two years tops. That was the agreement. She said she couldn't trust me yet... I totally get that now but at the time I asked how long would be long enough if it wasn't two months? If after a year I asked would she be willing? She couldn't promise anything.\n\nSo, I left that Friday night instead of Saturday morning. I said \"fuck it then\" and got a pint of vodka and subsequently got charged with a DUI... So I am no longer the shining example of a functional alcoholic (though, we all know that is a complete oxymoron).\n\nI can't express in words how ashamed of this I am, but I know some of you maybe understand. I don't care about putting myself at risk, but I could have hurt someone. My SO also broke up with me that day after a 12 hour stay in solitary at the local drunk tank.\n\nSo, fast forward a couple of weeks and I have an awesome mountain job that starts in a couple days. I have my stuff here in a hotel room I have been at a few days while I apartment shopped (I am really starting to hate hotel rooms), and I have an apartment lined up for Monday as a place to stay within bicycle distance of the job.\n\nHowever. Pain. Just solid fucking pain. I think I have done the best that I can for myself with all that has happened, but I am just so damn lonely and in despair that I messed so much up from a one night mistake. I felt I was getting through things. Then I lost the love of my life.\n\nThe self hatred is right in my face right now and I can't convince that demon to go away. I had to stay with my alcoholic father for a couple of days and that was torture. He would get so annoyingly drunk where he was repeating himself over and over. I just tried to get out of the house for walks.\n\nTo top it all off, my ex-SO and I have been talking and she sent me some Al-Anon posts... While looking through the forum I found her own posts and read about her experiences. So, today has been a total head-trip where I am obsessing over the posts she made, the text messages we have had back and forth since the DUI happened, and just generally trying to convince myself I am not insane (it's not working) and just trying to stay away from going out and getting something to drink to numb myself from all this.\n\nI have been thinking through everything I have put her through just sitting in a hotel room for three days. Realizing that there is nothing I can do to win her back besides remain sober and that is a crapshoot. I have friends I could call, but I don't want to put this on them.\n\nOH! and I just found out one of those friends just started going through radiation treatment for suspected lymphoma.\n\nI have no clue what I did to piss off whatever god or gods are out there this much to end up with these genetics, but... Gah! I guess it could always be worse. Time to try out AA again I suppose. I spent a lot of the day re-reading stuff from the big book (as well as Al-Anon stuff) and I have a meeting lined up for tomorrow.\n\nAnyways, if you made it this far thanks for listening and I hope you are all having a good weekend.\n\nI will do my best to remain in a state of IWNDWYT tonight and continue my new four day streak.",

   "selftext": "One of the most surprising parts of sobriety for me has been speaking to people on the phone with greater ease and frequency than before.\n\nWhen I was growing up in the '80s and '90s, phoning a friend was an essential part of my social life. I didn't need an excuse or reason; I just called. In high school, I'd talk for an hour or more with friends and girlfriends. This continued on into college, though with a bit less frequency as services like AIM and email became viable alternatives to phone communication. \n\nGradually, everyone got cell phones and dropped their landline service. Soon, my phone conversations were reduced to a minimum. I'd speak to my parents on the phone, but only after arranging a time in advance. When my parents called me without warning, my heart skipped a beat \u2014 I expected to hear that someone had died. On the rare occasions a friend would call me at random, it would annoy me. Couldn't they tell me what they wanted beforehand?\n\nAs my alcoholism deepened, avoiding phone calls became a convenient way to mask my addiction. Though I sent countless ill-advised emails and texts while drunk, I usually had the sense to avoid responding to messages until I'd sobered up the next day. Text messages and emails are, by definition, pre-meditated: I could edit what I wrote. If I typed something that didn't look good, I could delete it and start over. This wasn't possible in person or on the phone. Then it wasn't difficult to tell that I was loaded.\n\nI got sober and, some months later, found a sponsor in AA. He suggested that I do three things: meet him weekly to study the Big Book and work through the steps, attend 90 meetings in 90 days, and speak to three alcoholics in person or on the phone each day, excluding him. The first two suggestions I've readily adhered to. The third, though, has been much more difficult.\n\nI've been shy about exchanging numbers with other men at AA meetings, even though this is encouraged. When I do manage to get someone's number, I think about calling but often decide against it. Here's what goes through my head: He's going to think it's weird. He's going to be busy. There are going to be awkward pauses. The call will be abbreviated. Even though he says to call him anytime, he doesn't really mean it. It's an intrusion, after all. I'm interrupting him. And on and on.\n\nBut when I've worked up the courage to call someone, I've found that, almost without exception, he's been happy to hear from me. Sometimes he says he'll call me back, and he does. Often he has five, 10, or 15 minutes right then to chat. There are awkward pauses, but they aren't so bad. I often feel so much better after talking to him \u2014 as if it were a meeting in miniature.\n\nToday, I spoke to my sponsor about this subject \u2014 on the phone, natch. \"When you call someone you're helping him, too,\" he said. I hadn't thought of that \u2014 but it's true.\n\nI realize now that so much of my fear of speaking on the phone had little to do with the inefficiencies of the medium \u2014 but rather my lifelong shyness. One of the myths of sobriety is that it does away with your shortcomings; in fact, it reveals them for the world to see. I've always cared far too much about what other people have thought about me. My fear of calling people is just an expression of that. And it's something that I'm going to need more time to get used to. \n\nBut I'm going to try. And I'm going to not drink for the rest of today. ",

For the past 3 years or so I stopped for the most part and if I do drink I only have 1-2 drinks.\n\nWhy? Mostly because of the negative health effects of alcohol:\n\n* Drinking causes your skin to dry out, which makes you look older. /r/skincareaddiction \n\n* Excessive drinking can lead to burst capillaries on your face, especially your nose which is unsightly.\n\n* It\u2019s liquid calories, which means that it can make it easier to gain weight/fat\n\n* [I sleep terribly after 1-2 drinks, I always wake up at like 2-3am and can\u2019t fall back asleep again, which makes me tired for most of the next day.\n\n* Having a low tolerance is super cheap.\n\n* It lowers testosterone, which has lots of negative side effects\n\nI guess those are the big reasons.

   "selftext": "I've fucked. I've fucked up everything.\n\nI'll give some back story so you guys understand more.\n\nMy mom had multiple personality disorder. My dad was a drug addict and alcoholic. Since the age of 2 when my dad got busted with drugs at his friends, my grandma took me and i grew up with her until i was about 11. Throughout this time i saw my mom off and on in a group home and talked to my dad over the phone while he was in jail. When i was about 7\\-8 i got to start going to my dads apartment for the weekend sometimes when he wanted me. Often when i went to stay with him he was drunk. He would let me play on the computer and i wouldn't see him but for a few hours each weekend because he would either have his friends over getting plastered or he would be asleep. When i was around 11 i moved in with him and my step mom. My step mom sexually molested me. I didn't know that at the time, but now that i've gotten older i know. My step mom was very controlling, never letting me hangout with anyone and when i did have a girlfriend it was hell. She physically abused my dad, and they both were always fighting daily. \n\nEven then through out this time i would see my mom off and on when she either escaped her group home or i would get to visit her or her me. So, as i grew older i would see my mom around once every few months. I wasn't attached to her but i did get use to seeing her sometimes. It was nice. She may not have been mentally stable but i loved her nonetheless. So until i was 16 i saw her maybe 20\\-30 times.  Now when i was 16 she left. Completely. She moved to another state to live with her brother and didn't tell me. Never said goodbye or anything. That was devastating as i felt like somehow she left because of me, she didn't want me. Throughout this whole time in my life i used video games as a my fall back. I knew that my video games wouldn't leave me. \n\nWhen i was 18 I joined the military. I was only in for around 2 years because during that duration i tried committing suicide and was admitted for 3 weeks to a mental hospital. I was honorably discharged for weight gain, which happened after that when i started on my medicine. I met my wife in that time and we got married. We have been married for 5 years now. I can say they definitely have not been easy for either of us. We got full custody of our now 5 year old who we will be adopting and she had our youngest. After she had our youngest she had PPD. I did not help her like i should have through that and now she resents me for that. I understand that, and yes i know it was my fault i blame myself. Through our marriage we have had trust issues, and a lot of no communication. Mostly me though. She has gone to school and gotten her masters. I have not gone to school yet and stay at home with our kids for the last 3 years. I have lost both of my parents in the last 4 years. My mom to overdose and my dad to cancer. Both of which i didnt see before they passed since i joined the military and came here. \n\nIf we go to now, i have 2 loving kids and a wife who hates me for the way i've treated her and neglected her. At this point i have had severe depression disorder for the past 5 years. Lately i've had a very bad emotions problem. To the point that i can't control my emotions. I'll be nice for a few minutes and then turn around and be angry for no reason. I can't handle it anymore and it has taken a big toll on my wife. She has lost herself and so have I. Neither of us know who we are and she doesn't want me anymore. She has made that very clear. Throughout our marriage she has always thrown it at me that she is successful and I have done nothing with my life. She always strives to make sure I know that she's better then me. I told her i wanted a divorce so she can get away from me and fix herself the way she wants, which is exploring others. I can't deal with this while we are married, and will probably make it worse for her, so it's best if i exit myself from this marriage for my sake and our kids. Also i'm starting school in 2 months as well to better myself and for my kids.\n\nI go to the VA for therapy but now will be starting therapy once a week. \n\nWhat is wrong with me? Be very blunt please because i need to know what the fuck is wrong with me?",

I haven't even physically touched a girl since then. To be honest I haven't even had sex yet and the only thing I ever think about is what's wrong with me without hope of an answer. The thought \"I want to just disappear with the flick of a switch\" keeps echoing in my mind constantly, everyday.\nI'd attempted suicide by grabbing a bunch of pills from the medicine cabinet when I was 18 but ever since then I've only had thoughts of doing it as I've realized the repercussions of committing such an act. I've got a normal life with a part time job whilst studying my bachelor degree, however I still live with my family, which makes it even harder for me to actually go through with the act. \nSeeing their faces everyday just reminds me of the pain and suffering they would go through if I ever committed suicide; not just them, but my many friends as well. I don't know why I can't find someone to be with, I've been told by my female friends that I'm super nice and am good looking as well but every girl I ever meet just ends up friend-zoning me or just plainly has no interest in me. I just don't know what's wrong with me. The emptiness just grows.\nI inherited an addictive personality from my late alcoholic grandpa and have been abusing drugs and alcohol to cope with my depressive feelings since I turned 15. Sometimes I feel like weed is the only thing that's kept me sane and level headed whilst dealing with the demons in my head. Then other days I feel like it's the fuel to my depressive fire. I've been cutting down on all substances a lot lately and am planning to stop completely soon, but the emptiness just grows deeper in me and I just feel so trapped. No matter what I do in life, nothing feels fulfilling, it feels like I never accomplish anything. \nI just want my existence to disappear and for it to be like I was never even here. That way I'd be wholeheartedly happy to leave this earth.",

So I've been drinking pretty regularly for the last couple of years. But only recently I have noticed I cant go more than around 3 days without having a binge night. I cant not drink for more than a week even if I tell myself that I wont. I dont think I get withdrawals or anything but after going for a few days straight without drinking, I find myself feeling 'deserving' of having a binge and go buy myself a bottle of wine or drink from my homebrew. Is this a warning sign that I should drastically limit my intake or am I a long way from hurting myself and others so I can keep drinking? I do my drinking mostly by myself mind you. ",

I am fortunate to have been able to stop everything and advance my career\n\nI currently have a friend who is an opiate and cocaine addict.  She has a 9 year old daughter. CPS got involved with her life. She has been clean from coke and opiates for almost a month but she told me it's only due to drug tests and the day shes done she will do coke and pills. She also told me she has no desire to ever get a job (shes 26) and wants to be an escort for her whole life. She does not hide this from her daughter. She lost her house, car and everything and lives with her mom currently. She is prescribed xanax so shes taking as many of them as she can and someone's gabapentin bc it doesn't show on drug tests, drinking, and ordered kratom. She also said her therapy said she can start methadone since shes having a hard time so her plan is to do methadone until she can do drugs. So cps is going to close her case soon and nothing has been accomplished.  She will remain a prostitute and drug addict and keep her child. I feel like shit bc I can't help her or get her to see that her behavior is not healthy.  \nShe goes to treatment and it seems likeal it is doing is teaching her how to manipulate  her family more. They tell her she shouldn't work(which to her is an excuse to prostitute) they tell her to get on methadone (which to her is ok bc its prescribed) and she is using all the terms they teach her as excuses for what she does.  I feel like treatment is making it worse. Her mom asks me what to do. I would have kicked her out and let her hit rock bottom.. it worked for me.

I am not giving her shit\nHow do you get through to someone who sits there and tells u this is not a problem.

Sometimes functioning well, sometimes not.  I stopped because I wasn't feeling well, even when sober, and I took a good look at my life and physical environment and saw it was stagnant, dirty, and in disrepair.  For those of you who are seriously considering stopping, here's some benefits you'll experience right away, like starting within the first few days:\n\n1. No more crippling hangovers.  \n2. No more of those not-so-crippling, yet day-ruining hangovers.  You know what I mean.\n3. You'll be able to drive whenever you want to.  So go get that milk shake.\n4. You'll be clear-headed during an emergency involving your family and friends.  This could actually save a loved-one's life.\n5. Lots more spare time.  Like hours of it.  Weekends actually feel like two whole days.\n6. Cleaner, safer surroundings.  Many of us report the happy urge to clean and work on stuff.\n7. No more feelings of shame when taking the recycling back, or rolling the bin out for pickup. This is one of those crappy weekly rituals where many of us came face-to-face with the hard truth of our alcohol dependency.  Look at all the damn bottles and cans.  Ho-ly shit.  \n8. If you're taking any medications that forbid drinking, quitting alcohol will remove the possibility of having a seriously bad alcohol-related reaction.  In fact, your medications may work better.  There's a reason they put \u201cdon't drink alcohol\u201d on the bottle.\n9. Better digestion!  Good times in the bathroom, guaranteed.  \n10. If you're counting calories, you can subtract all of those empty alcohol calories and enjoy fulfilling meals and desserts.\n11. Within the first few days of not drinking, your insulin resistance, cholesterol, and blood pressure begin to drop.  By the end of a month, they've dropped significantly. https://www.metro.news/lab-why-you-should-try-going-dry/1059965/\n12. Your risk of cancer drops.  By the end of one month, two factors that promote cancer growths have declined significantly, like by 41 and 74 percent.  See the link above.\n\nThere are additional immediate benefits that can be added to this list, I'm sure.  I'd be interested to hear them, because they are so encouraging. There are also great long-term benefits to quitting drinking, of course, but I wanted to offer something helpful to those starting out, and also for those who are considering it.  I never thought I'd make a month, let alone 9 months.  It gets easier, as long as you put your sobriety first.  ",

Kill 2 birds with 1 stone, right? Well, the reverse is true, too: Kill both lungs and liver when I indulge one bad habit! Anyways, I even KNOW whilst driving to the restaurant that this type of thing is likely to happen. So, I settle my bill, seek out a pack of cigarettes, and hell, while I'm here I might as well pickup a couple tallboys! I mean, I'd regret not doing it when I'm having a cigarette. Oh, and yeah, once I have a cigarette I quickly realize I didn't want it the way I thought I did. Sigh. And, the thought of being alone in my home makes me keep in this cycle, induling all these bad habits. \n\nI think I need to hit the gym for a couple hours every weekend, to kill the time and get healthier. I need to lose 30 lbs to look my best and hopefully meet a nice, cute 30\\-something woman. I dream of people saying how thin I look, and that I beat drinking. It really would be something, and, having abs again? Like I was 20? I really took life for granted, and all the attention I received. Now? I'm like a bloated caricature of my past. I don't like me as much, sigh. IWDWYT ",

She has passed out smoking -woke up with her bed burning.  She has drank antifreeze.  She has been arrested numerous times.  The list goes on and on.  The latest -she was hospitalized she has been too many times to count. They actually had to put her in a comma to detox her.  My mom said the first thing she did when she got home was drink. Her first night home I guess she was stumbling through her apartment complex in the rain- someone found her fallen in the parking lot- passed out and bleeding - she uses a walker she is only 52 years old.  I remember a long time ago an addiction counselor saying to me - \" at some point this thing goes too far- and there is no turning back\"  I hate to believe that is true - but you know even if my sister could come back from the addiction she has destroyed so much of her life she really has nothing to come back to. Those of us that stopped drinking before it ever got even close to that bad - are so lucky so blessed BUT.... it is also easy to believe- well maybe I could drink again I am no way near as bad as some folks - like my sister.  However I am convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that when I had that moment of clarity and decided my drinking was getting out of control and I was so scared of where it could go - I believe my sister had that same moment of clarity but she made a different decision - that is the only difference between her and I - I MADE a different decision!  I am so grateful - the best decision I have ever made.  I never want to doubt or forget where it could have gone!  Sober on folks it is a really good decision!",

   "selftext": "TL;DR: I deserve the ultimatum, but my fucked up paradox of a brain wants me to reach for the booze.\n\nI fucked up four days ago and drank. A lot. Long story short I ended up where I so often do when I drink excessively: self-harming and borderline suicidal. The police were involved. Mental health services were (and still are) involved. What a mess I made.\n\nNow, I recently moved back in with family as I have ongoing issues with my mental health (patiently waiting in NHS queue to see a specialist psychiatrist for nearly a year now) and I was unable to sustain my independence. Fine. In fact, great! I was relieved; it felt like a new start. A deus ex fucking machina into the tragic trainwreck of a story that was my life.\n\nAnd I was doing *so* well. I made my bed, did my own washing and drank tea. I was going on lovely walks to see lovely fields and lovely sheep. I was waiting patiently for the mental health services I was under in my previous city to transfer me to a Care Coordinator nearer to my parents house. I slashed every tie, blocked every enabling friend on my phone and welcomed my new quiet country life with open arms and sensible footwear.\n\nFast forward to now, and still no contact from the mental health services. I chase them up: \"you've already been transferred to Bum-Fuck-Nowhere\". I ring Bum-Fuck-Nowhere: \"sorry, no record of that - you need to go back to your GP and get a referral. Can take up to six weeks.\"\n\nSo, by this point - about a week ago - I'm still waiting but think, \"no big deal, I'm doing alright. I'm sober and healthy and things are looking up!\" And I decide that, yes, I will go and visit my mate at the weekend. Two hours into the drive, I've rationalised having 'one or two'. For old times sake.\n\nNow, that night (nor the following) wasn't awful. I had fun, in fact. I felt a little bit like me again. But oh god the guilt. The shame. And when I arrived back at my parents I just knew they knew, y'know? But we are English and we do not talk about what we are feeling so they said nothing, and I said nothing. We watched Westworld in stone-cold, British-y silence.\n\nThe next day: the same, and I'm pretending everything's cool and normal and that they don't have a fuck-up alcoholic nutter for a daughter. My mum's doing a poor job of the same. My dad is fucking Vulcan in his stoicism. Inevitably he blows up. But he does it at her and I can hear every single horrible word through the bedroom floor. It got heated. I felt like a scared little girl again.\n\nSo, I grabbed my purse and went and bought a bottle of gin and two cans of cider. (Let's see little girls drink like this, ha!) I drank one can on the drive back from the supermarket (ha!), the other in the park (ha! ha!) then I went up to my bedroom and pounded the gin until I forgot that any other person existed to get mad at me.\n\nToday, my mum - a woman who so rarely loses her temper, who loves her children fiercely, who would probably kill a bitch that ever hurt me - told me straight up: \"This is your last chance. I can't take it anymore. You do this again, *I'm out.*\"\n\nIt was like a cold splash of sulphuric acid on my face. It was like missing the bottom step and falling into an off-key howling abyss. Fuck, man. \n\nNow I'm struggling, *really* struggling with every single negative feeling, the instinct to just grab a cold one or ten. The little devil on my shoulder is saying, \"well, old chap, she and the world clearly hate you, so I say have at it.\"\n\nSo, I welcome it all: advice, random tangents, jokes about produce (clean), distraction with magic. Anything. I've got to get through tonight. I will not drink with you today.",

Things are going so much better; I talked with my doctor and told her the extent of my drinking and she helped me come up with a treatment plan that includes AA, medication (Antabuse), and therapy. I\u2019m going to meetings whenever I can, taking the meds daily (they work, I highly recommend anyone thinking about it to give it a shot), and therapy begins Wednesday. \n\nI have not yet made peace with my alcoholism, but I have acknowledged her. \n\nOriginally, it was unclear whether or not my partner of 2.75 years and I were going to stay together, but things are getting better with that and we\u2019re going to stay together; he\u2019s finally talking to me and looking me in the eyes again, holding my hand again and giving me affection. \n\nI thanked the teachers at my children\u2019s school who took my keys away when I arrived drunk to pick them up. They were very sweet about it. \n\nI talked to all of the people who I called that day in a drunken stupor and explained to them what happened. I\u2019ve made peace with my family. \n\nEveryone is being so supportive and my kids are happy. I\u2019m happy and humbled. \n\nI\u2019ve been working out a lot and eating healthily and have lost 7 lbs! I got my teeth cleaned and hosted a slumber party for my daughter this weekend; her first slumber party ever. It was a success. :)\n\nI have three interviews this week for what sound like really great jobs and I have a really good feeling about one in particular where I will potentially earn twice my regular salary. \n\nThings are going good. \n\nBUT, I\u2019m getting that itch, that urge to self destruct/sabotage that has been the precursor to every relapse in the past. Whenever things go right in my life, and I\u2019m doing well, I get anxious and instinctually run right to behavior that derails any potential success and brings me chaos. Normally the method of delivery is alcohol. \n\nBut, I\u2019m not drinking with you guys today, or tomorrow, or anytime in the future, so I\u2019m going to have to turn my back on chaos.

   "selftext": "Serious question.\n\nI split a house that is owned by our grandfather. My brother drinks daily. He is a functioning alcoholic, however it impedes into my life. I've addressed the issue many times with him and my family but nobody wants to do a single thing about it, except me. I confronted him again today about it and he told me I have to deal with it. I have my business here in this house, I cannot just leave.\n\nI'm the younger brother in this situation and he tries to belittle me anytime I bring up the issue. He turns it around on me and talks about my personal life and tries to use a thousand personal attacks instead of dealing with the issue. He's told me he will not move out and he will not stop drinking. Therefore, what am I left to do? Nothing? It angers me to no end. It's completely ruined our relationship as brothers and honestly I want nothing to do with him anymore. However, I do not have an answer to this problem. The family has tried before in the past but has since given up on trying to deal with the issue. We're both in our 30's. Like I said, I run my business out of the garage and cannot just up and leave.\n\nMy grandfather came to the house once to deal with the issue, during one of his binges. My grandpa is older and realized he could not handle the situation himself, so he handed it off to my dad, who is too passive to deal with the issue as well. It continues to fall on me. I am not in the legal right to kick him out of the house, but is there something I can do? If my dad has the power in the situation and I decided to kick him out and do what I can to discuss with my dad, does that seem too harsh? What would you do? Have any of you been in a situation like this before? Am I just stuck?\n\nMy business is my life and I don't make enough to move into another place as we live in an expensive area. I've considered getting a different job and selling all my equipment and company in order to move into a different situation, basically giving up my LIFE in order to get away from him. I'm just so lost and feel trapped. Any words of advice would be extremely helpful. Thank you",

   "selftext": "Al-anon - \nI\u2019m an adult woman in my 30s with two younger siblings, also adults. We have always lived in the same city with my father, but in the last few years have been relocating to different states. I\u2019m in the process of moving ~400 miles away for work. I have a wonderful husband, 3 year old daughter, and I\u2019m pregnant and due in August. My father has been an alcoholic certainly for the last 10 years, and potentially longer. We have never been close. My parents divorced when I was 15, and before that we were always afraid of my dad because of his explosive temper. I\u2019m sure he has some personality and mental health diagnoses, but has not been evaluated. He was in a construction accident when we were kids, and is a below the knee amputee. He does not work and lives on the settlement from that accident. \n\nIn 2016, his second wife - who was kind of holding things together for him - left him and filed a PPO (totally understandable, I don\u2019t blame her).  He did a brief stint in in-patient rehab on the insistence of his sister and friends, checked out ama, and got a DUI. He is now living by himself and has very limited contact with anyone. (He has 5 sisters also living in town.)\n\nWe find it nearly impossible to address his drinking with him as he will simply lie about it and is an unreliable narrator. He plays any support people off of each other (e.g. telling me my aunt has dementia because she caught him in a lie - telling my aunt I\u2019m an unfeeling bitch who never calls- etc.) at this point I\u2019m not sure if he even understands he\u2019s lying. \n\nThe most recent problem is that my brother is visiting from out of town and went to stay with my dad for a few nights. He called me frantic to say that there are dead animals in the barn that were in my dad\u2019s care. My dad gave him a bullshit story about parasite infection and the state coming out to take air samples. Utter rubbish.  He has contacted a friend in the police, and it is being looked into. If I had to guess, I would say that they were neglected because my father was in a bender and forgot them. \n\nI had gotten him to surrender dogs to me before that I put in a rescue, but I didn\u2019t even realize he had more animals. \n\nI\u2019m sick for the animals, I\u2019m sick that my dad is so sick this could happen, I\u2019m sick I\u2019m not a better daughter who could have stopped this, and I\u2019m also sick because I\u2019m not more interested in stepping in and helping. I\u2019m exhausted with it, and I have my own young family to worry about.  \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? Absolution? Steps forward?",

They are similar, but mom doesn't drink. But when dad gets home drunk, he just starts shitting on everyone, literally.Always talks how we aren't doing anything, they do everything and that we don't deserve anything. Altough dad never beated my ass up, unlike mother who beated her children. Lica got most beaten out of us. \nAlso they are opssesed with money. Once I said them I tryed with like 2 times and they tought that I am drugie and addict. They acted like it is fucking heroin or some shit. They probably thought I am a dealer. \n\n\nI have two sisters, one 6 years older(let's call her Lica) and second one 8 years older(Lana) then me. Before Lana left for collage, I had awful relationship with Lica. Lana and me had amazing relationship and I always enjoyed spending time with her. \n\nAnd I, I am the guy who likes to play games,go in gym, have probably just one good friend, sometimes get out on saturdays, occasionally smoke pot and in last 6 month rarely drink. In last few months I noticed sympthoms of derealization and depersonalization. \n\nSo, eversince my sister left for collage, our relationship has changed. I had perfect relationship with her and after she left for collage she wasn't coming back home for months despite that she was 30 km away from home. And than relationship with Lica was improving to the point where I enjoy spending time with Lica more than Lana because Lana treats me like 7 years ago when she left for collage. Lica knows when I am in mood far talk and when ain't. I mean she is like my mom. \n\nThe problem that I have is that Lana is constantly jumping on my head and around me, and I don't like shit like that because when I want to interact with her she is on her phone not caring what I talk. And now an hour ago I felt like they set me up to tell my dad how I punched her. She started jiggling me, and I was okay with that for first few times, she continued with that and I started being defensive and trying to get mom and Lana away from me.So i pushed her on her bed, nothing serious, she again is jiggling me, and I don't like that and I said that to her but she continued. I started running from my bedroom towards the kitchen and she started screaming and then slapped me, ripped my t-shirt, and proceeded to dad who is in living room that I kicked her, beated, and other shit and she was also screaming and then slapped me again infront of parents. They were saying how my behavior is unacceptable, how games are ruining my mind and other things.They sent me to the psychologist because they thought I am crazy or some shit like that. Psychologist tought that problem was me smoking weed(even tough I smoked couple times back then). \n\nI mean I am little bit asocial, but that is because I don't have reason why should I spend time with parents, because they will always prise themselves, we can never watch something together, always dad has to decide what is gonna be on TV. \nIn primary school, I liked being more in school despite hating school then home, because that is when mom found out that dad is cheating on her and that is when they fought. That is time when he started being dad, until than he just didn't care about us, all thing were left on mom's shoulders.\n\nI think I'm gonna leave when I finish high school or after collage probably Canada or some place like that far away from this shit.\nIf somebody reads this, any help would be massive for me.\nTL:DR-Dad prick, mom prick, boring sister and stupid problems.

Little did I know, he drinks about a case a day. So I relapsed, and they drove me to the hotel at 5 pm. \n\nThat was in February, and I've done a pretty good job of not drinking to excess, and not drinking but a few days a week. I've been wanting to quit again, but there was always that false sense of security that I could keep myself from drinking too much.\n\nYesterday, we went to my father-in-law's wedding. He told me to bring some beer, so I did. It was a beautiful ceremony. We got their early, and I started right when I got there. After everything was done, my wife wanted to know if we could go to her mom's for a dip in the pool. I said yes. I had timed my drinking and reasoned I was safe to drive and within the legal limit.\n\nThe drive to my mother-in-law's house was uneventful, but we did pass 3 or 4 people pulled over. The first thing my mother-in-law said was to ask me if I was buzzed. Now, she was pretty drunk when we got there, but it got me thinking. What if I was buzzed? Would I have really known or admitted it? Ive always prided myself on the fact that I don't drink and drive and NEVER with the kids in car. I mulled over that for a while, how one day I might be handed a few beers, then have to leave. A DUI would effectively end my career for a good while.\n\nThat night ( my wife talked me into staying the night ), I drank the beer I had and was content. My wife rarely drinks, but she got into her mom's bar and kept bringing mixed drinks, and I noticed as the night went on she was hammered.\n\nMy mother-in-law and her husband got home and they were hammered. This morning he bragged about how he drove home like a champ. The icing on the cake was when I decided to lay down, I find my mother-in-law wandering around her bedroom naked ( and she is NOT a bad looking woman ) and then wants to talk to me. My wife, was changing and started talking to her mom so she was naked as well. They were being loud, and the kids were stirring, so I got them both to bed finally, after they woke the kids up from laughing. And no, the kids didn't see them because they were in her bedroom. This morning, the deck by the pool was surrounded with beer cans, a liquor bottle, and 2 bottles of wine.\n\nI want to point out that we aren't trashy people. All of us have good jobs and careers. I actually had fun yesterday, and so did she. I've been wanting to quit again since I started, and the sheer ridiculousness of the day has pushed me to that point. \n\nI've put on 30 pounds since February, and was trying to lose 15 then. I hate waking up after a night of drinking. I've gotten to where I feel guilty if I just have one drink. My blood pressure is high, and the alcohol doesn't only cause it, but the weight gain makes it worse.\n\nPlease pray for me. I know I can do this, but this sub makes it so much easier. Also, how do I reset my badge?",

All of her drinking bull shit and everything just made me feel weak as there was nothing I could do to stop her and I guess all of this just got to me. my mum would have these nights about 5 times a year where she would drink too much or the drink would affect her in a weird way and she would start doing and saying horrible things. when I was 10 she kicked my older brother out for trying to get her to stop drinking (my older brother and I where the first people to notice and do anything, everyone else did nothing until she slit her wrist), my brother lived at my grans for 9 months on the other side of the uk. another time she kicked my brother out for the same thing and he ended up sofa surfing but one night he had no where to stay and her almost froze to death in a blizzard when he was sleeping on a bench. I can go on and on; tell you about how I started crying in a year 7 music lesson because the night before my mum got really drunk in front of one of my friends. then my parents made us move to the other side of england where I have no friends and everyone treats me like shit because I am \u201cposh\u201d. people take my stuff and attack me for no reason and I am scared of going to a teacher to get help about that as it will only make it worse.\n\nfirst thing is actually killing myself, probably with an exit bag, but this is the least favourable option. \n\nsecond thing is telling the councillor at school. I dont know if I should do this one and I can give a few reasons why. reason 1, if I say I am suicidal then they she has to tell my parents and my parents will freak and take all of my stuff away. reason 2. people will treat me different. \n\nyou are probably still thinking option 2 and so am I but it is scary and I really don\u2019t know if I should. what if it goes around school, it would only give the bullies a reason to pick on me and in that case option 2 is terrible. please can someone advise me on what to do.

I didn\u00b4t trust anyone (my bf cheated on me several times, my friends didn\u00b4t support me, at work my boss and colleagues took advance of my \u201cniceness\u201d) and I was blaming all of them for my pain.\n\nOne year and a half ago my bf broke up with me, my friends from the new city stopped talking to me (and viceversa), being completely alone but for my friends back in my home city.\n\nAnd guess what, those friends are all gamers, so playing several hours a day with them while speaking in teamspeak become all my life. I had everything I need not to feel like crap.\n\nIn the last few months I set several goals to improve myself, and I didn\u00b4t last more than a week for any of those because the only thing I that I *really* wanted was coming home and play (with everything that comes with it like a lot of coke zero, carb based dinner and a lot of smoking).\nI kind of gave up on making any improvement, I just assumed that I\u00b4m that shitty and I should be content with what I have. Until two days ago, which by some random act, youtube took me to Game Quitters channel (thanks Cam Adair) and realized that I\u00b4ve been moving my problems for one addiction to another for years (Alcoholism --&gt; TV shows --&gt; Love Dependency --&gt; Buying stuff --&gt; Videogames) and every time I went to a therapist I solved the addiction without coming back to the root of the problem (self-love, care and taking action to get what I want in life).\n\nI\u00b4ve got a history of addictions, and while I don\u00b4t believe in \u201cAddictive personalities\u201d, in my case there is a pattern to avoid confronting my problems getting attached to addictive stuff. And because of that I know that I lack of self-control and moderation, therefore I need to cut off with gaming the hard way. That\u00b4s why I\u00b4m selling my PC (Instead I\u00b4ll buy a Surface, because I still need a PC for work), accounts and consoles.\n\nBut I\u00b4m scared as hell. Without a social net, having no hobbies and previous failures it\u00b4s going to be difficult. I\u00b4m not a social person and expert procrastinator and I fear the most being rejected. Anyway, I\u00b4ll do my best trying to get myself out of my own misery and I hope you guys will be supportive in the weeks to come and I would love to share the beginning of my new life with you.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read :)\n\n**UPDATE (04/06/2018)**\n\nWell, I sold my computer, with all the gaming accounts associated. Since then I have been numb, spending most of the time watching TV shows (which it should be the next thing to address I guess) and not going out. I know I should replace gaming with a lot of different activities to fulfill the void, but it is harder than I though. \n\nI have been really close to purchase a second hand Xbox a couple of times, and I still don\u00b4t know how I manage to stop it.\n\nIf there is any newcomers reading this let me give you a piece of advice. If you are going to quit videogames:\n\n- Sell all your hardware/accounts (or gift it to a friend/non-profit org) and put the money aside in a savings account or something like that (the idea is not being able to get the money if you have an instant regret and try to buy a console or PC).\n- Think about the possible points of failure that can make you come back to VG (explain the situation to your family/friends, unsubscribe from gaming channels on Youtube, etc).\n- The most important one: Plan, plan, plan. Make sure you have a new daily routine on paper so it\u00b4s easier to follow. If you don\u00b4t plan the most probably outcome will be substituting VG with something as unhealthy as them (this is what happened to me with TV Shows).\n- Check daily your source of unhappiness. After this days without playing I realized I am not happy at my current job, it is stressing me out and I am not learning/progressing in my career. \n\nLooking to the bright side, I decided to make an arrangement with my current employer to get out of my job getting paid and move out to another country, which will make me out of my confort zone and probably help to continue improving.\n\n\n",

   "selftext": "Hello all, I had my last glass of wine with my parents at brunch for Mother's Day. Since then, nothing. I used to go through a fifth every day or two, plus beer, maybe wine, and who knows if I was having a dinner party or going out. It was just enough for me, need to do more in this life. I'm struggling a bit with that part, so I don't come home and drink anymore, I bought a motorcycle, I try to go out riding, take my dog to the park, or just tidy up around the house, it feels good to get stuff done, and it's great to wake up to a clean house without bottles all over from the night before.\n\nI have a full 6k+ homebrewery in my basement, and I'm taking inventory now to get it on the market, that really sucks as I can make some really great beers with my system. I wish I could find a way to keep brewing and enjoy it all.\n\nI went from drinking every day for the past 4-6 years to stopping on Monday officially. I've been supplementing pretty hard beforehand and still do everyday. Aside from the normal D3, fish oil, multi, I've taken everyday for years now. I've been keeping the blood sugar up by eating a good portion of fresh fruit everyday, and eating smaller meals more regularly (dinner used to be whiskey and popcorn). To combat the lack of alcohol and help ease my body I've started including the following into my daily regimen.\nMagnesium Citrate\nN-Acetyl-L-Cysteine\n5-Hydroxytryptophan\nDOPA Mucuna\nB-1\nB-12\nB-5\nSchizandra berry\n\nMonday and Tuesday night I had sweats, but that's it. I was a little surprised, but everyone is different I suppose, and it feels incredible to move forward each day on this path. A few small cravings this weekend, I've been alone, but I still have beer on tap at the house, and a cellar full of wine and beer. I want to believe I can get back one day to just enjoying literally wine with dinner or the like, but I was not able to stop at one or two back then. IWNDWYT!",

I am in my 40s and last year my mother was diagnosed with cancer. So between traveling back and forth to her and trying to spend time with my husband, the alcohol became a nice wind down and let loose once a week. My husband would smoke a joint and I would drink 6 pack of wine coolers while sitting out back during the summer. Then I decided that the wine coolers weren't that high in alcohol content and just sugar! So I switched to a bottle of red wine. Then I started drinking earlier on Saturdays, my drinking time became 4PM instead of 8 or nine, and because of that I needed 2 bottles of wine. Now I find myself wanting it all the time and 4 pm is now 3 pm. And today is the first time I'm drinking on a work night! Tomorrow is a big event at work and I've been on vacation all week. I've been letting loose every other day. And here I am polishing off a bottle and a half of wine, my reasoning is, it's still earlier, I can feel fine in the morning. I think overall it has to do with the sugars and not just the alcohol... but still. I want to add... I've never felt guilty about drinking. I have always been able to do whatever I needed to the next day. I don't cancel plans. I know in my mind what an alcoholic is...\n\nBut I still wonder... am I becoming one?",

   "selftext": "Maybe it\u2019s depression speaking and tanking my self worth, maybe it\u2019s just how emotional abuse leaves a person, but I can\u2019t fully convince myself I was emotionally abuse by my mom even when I don\u2019t know what else it could be. I think I imagine I\u2019ve always been a terrible daughter, so it becomes understandable for me to be treated harshly.\n\nBefore cutting her from my life, she wrangled around $2,500 from me usually by way of preying on my emotions (needing money for cosmetic surgery because she\u2019s so miserable, needing money for her boyfriend to take a flight because his brother is getting married, needing money for an apartment or else we have to give up the dog), and always promised to pay me back but always found some reason that she couldn\u2019t. I kick myself for giving in, but I definitely took some breaking down before I\u2019d give any money over. I never wanted to to begin with. I barely made any money at the time, she was a nurse making like three times as much as I did per hour, and for most of these issues where she needed money it was shit she caused or where I had no involvement in any of it (like I didn\u2019t know her boyfriend at the time).\n\nShe kept promising to pay me back with her tax returns that she blamed her ex for causing to be late (no idea if it\u2019s true at all), but when those finally came in, she instead basically told me she\u2019s keeping all of it to make up for the costs of taking care of me. While I was never good at it, and it was making my mental health spiral out of control (and I gave fair warning that I couldn\u2019t handle things), I had currently spent close to a year being basically a substitute mom for my youngest sister (while having to also take care of my poorly-behaved other younger sisters), scheduling half the week off work to watch her to save my family from having to spend money on daycare. I was handling things so poorly that I even offered to pay with my own money to bring in a babysitter or help cover daycare, even though it would\u2019ve left me with nothing. She wouldn\u2019t budge and I felt powerless.\n\nEventually one day, when someone else got home to watch the kids I ran off from home genuinely contemplating suicide, and was yelled at for it when I got home. Part of me knew it was hopeless, but I admitted how I was feeling. It devolved into me being told that yes, my mom attempted suicide once, but she was a dumb teenager, and yes my dad committed suicide (within the past five years of this happening), but he was an alcoholic, I\u2019m just being stupid acting this way. She and her boyfriend forced me to go out with them for ice cream even though I wasn\u2019t hungry, got furious at me for not eating and instead putting mine in the freezer when we got back home, and then my mom defended her boyfriend when he nearly punched me (the next attempt to solve my depression was some magic trick involving quarters that I shoved away\u2014apparently they thought so little of me that shiny coins was supposed to help me), telling me that I\u2019m acting like a bitch.\n\nThe next morning I overheard her making jokes about me committing suicide to one of my sisters while I was getting ready for work. On the bus to work she then texted me that I\u2019m not welcome home anymore unless I pay $550 per month to live there (as part of the babysitting deal, I wasn\u2019t paying rent and she argued against me paying for it or babysitting before despite in other instances clawing money out of me, and with half/most of my week spent unable to work, I probably made at most $600 in a given month). I decided that I didn\u2019t need to stay there anymore, grabbed my important shit, and left to stay with a coworker until I could get into my own cheap apartment. While grabbing my things, she smugly told me I\u2019d never make it in the world and would come crawling back.\n\nWhile I\u2019m probably gonna kill myself anyway and she\u2019s probably this half-right, I never did go back.\n\nEventually though she caused trouble yet again, by abandoning the apartment we shared after I had been gone, and letting me get on the hook with debt collectors (thankfully, this has been effectively cleared up for years now and my credit doesn\u2019t seem affected). It honestly caused me to dread phone calls, enough to get physical reactions when called even now unless I know who is calling. Because it was tied to her I bit the bullet and told her what was happening, especially since I was getting calls at work. Unsurprisingly, she kept coming up with reasons why she couldn\u2019t even meet me halfway on paying the debt, always a sob story about how she just doesn\u2019t have the money and they won\u2019t work with her at all, she would *totally* pay $X per month but they won\u2019t let her, whatever. Given I was getting harassed and had way less income than her, I finally grew half a backbone and suggested she save up the amount she *would* pay monthly until she has enough to cover *something* at least. I was rewarded by being accused of not caring about my family, and my mom bemoaning that I couldn\u2019t be more loving like my deceased father. That was when I finally cut all ties. Before that, though, she also remarked via text that it\u2019s funny that my *sisters* don\u2019t find her abusive, complete with a little ;)\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the more major incidents that come to mind. She would get mad at me if my few friends showed up at the door (as though I control that), she would snap at me over my weight despite her being much heavier than me, she would basically call me an idiot and chew me out over not knowing things I wasn\u2019t taught to do, at least once she made me spend the day cleaning my sisters\u2019 bedroom (which mind you looked like a hoarder house) while letting them get away with absolutely anything like I was goddamned Cinderella\u2026 her general behavior was such that when I accidentally water damaged my cheap cellphone, I was so utterly terrified of what she would do or say that I hid the damage for more than a week while trying to repair it during my photography class.\n\nI don\u2019t know why though I can\u2019t figure out if this was abuse or not. I know she was a terrible person. She wasn\u2019t bad to just me. She\u2019s even forged an ex\u2019s signature on divorce papers so she could dump him quicker and get in with the new fling, and then dodged every child support payment she could while spending her money on constant new toys that she gives up before long. Apparently my youngest sister has cried and tried to fight having to visit her.\n\nIs my self-esteem *so* bad that I look at shit like this and just think \u201cwell I mean I was shitty too, you see,   \u201d?",

(And want to make it thousands more)\n\nFunny how after years of first being in denial then hiding my alcoholism (perhaps not all that successfully) from my friends and family I now feel like I can\u2019t talk to them about my recovery either.  With friends - several of whom drink - I sense telling them openly that I\u2019ve quit will come with judgement and distance (as they assume I\u2019ll judge them).  With family - even my husband and kids - I expect skepticism that I\u2019ve actually quit.  I said something dumb to my 14 year old son last night and I could almost see him crane his neck to see if I had a wine glass next to me.  So this journey is for me - and I will be judged by myself and right now it feels so good to be on the right track!\n\nMy story is (I think) not too uncommon, other than that I started drinking later than most.  Didn\u2019t drink at all in HS, I fact only drank 2X ever before I turned 21 in my senior year at college.  Then it was super casual - maybe once or twice a month.  Then I made a friend in my mid 20\u2019s, she became my drinking buddy and we and our husbands would meet up to play cards and drink.  Later I became friends with a neighbor who\u2019s graceful hospitality never let my wine glass be empty.  Occasional drinking became daily drinking.  Then I started the routine of quitting periodically to prove I could - nope, I don\u2019t have a problem.  Eventually, I even started calling myself an alcoholic to some people but wore it like a badge rather than a confession and just kept on drinking.  Sometime last year I noticed myself starting to hide the extent of my habit - sneaking empty bottles outside to recycling when no one was looking.  Drinking wine from an opaque coffee mug... yep I had a problem so I decided to cut back, and failed over and over again.  11 days ago was the first time in my life I\u2019ve blacked out - and that was the watershed moment for me.  Lots of embarrassing evidence of my drunkenness around my house that NO ONE has brought up.  That\u2019s when I decided this wasn\u2019t about cutting back - I was done.  I am doing this for myself and for my kids, but I am doing it invisibly - some day I\u2019ll open up about my struggle and my shame with the kids so they have a chance to not repeat my downslide and struggle to be healthy.  \n\nThanks so much for being out there, for listening and helping give me strength!  \n\nIWNDWYT",

Recently I tried to kill myself, I drove into a wall, I was under the influence at the time and was tired of going around in circles with my drinking/drug problem. I managed to stay sober for a month but drank again at the weekend (becoming suicidal again).\n\nI've been in and out of AA for the past two years and I'm now wondering if I should investigate other ways of recovering. \n\nWhere I live there is one AA meeting a week, and maybe only two/four people attend. \n\nI'm currently on acamrposite (meh) and anti depressants\n\nAll suggestions welcome\n",

   "selftext": "Hi. I'm a hard drinker, ranging from 400ml 40% to 800ml 40% per day when I drink. I'm not drinking every day, but more often than not (I'd say 3-5 days per week on average, over the last few months). \n\nI want off the ride. Now, I don't think the \"no drinking\" part will be hard, but I'm afraid of the side effects it can bring. I've done CT before, but I haven't been wise enough to look up the side effects. Normally it'd take me about 3-4 days to back to \"normal\" (i.e. completely sober, without insomnia or cravings), and a week before my normal mood return.\n\nI'm not really sure where I'm going with this but... Maybe some encouragement perhaps idk.\n\n\nEDIT: 48h and counting! Been a bit rough, but I manage. I was about to fall off the wagon yesterday when I read about kindling further down. I went to my local liqour store and vought my usual poison of choice (it isn't hard liqour as described in my post, it's 21%) albeit less than I had the previous days. However, I couldn't bring myself to open the bottles, so I didn't. Pulse is still normal, looking around is still a bit different (due to not being off the influence for awhile. Similar to when I've tried to stop nicotine) but nothing out of the ordinary. My excessive sweating seems to have stopped, I fell asleep a bit later than usual but could sleep just fine, and my stomach seems to be returning to normal. All in all, can't complain!",

I see thousands of people doing moderation and it looks so easy.  I've spoken to some of them.  They can't seem to understand why anyone couldn't stop at just 1 or 2.\n\nI had a dream the other day.  I was in a bar with new work friends.  I felt like there was something wrong with being there but didn't know what.  When asked what I wanted to drink, I actually drew a blank.  I couldn't think of anything.  Then it came back to me.  \"Bulliet Bourbon, neat\" .  I then pictured the drink and said \"wait, make that a double\".   Picturing the small glass of bourbon made me panic that it wasn't enough.  Literally, I felt panic in my dream.  I am conditioned from looking at the bottle after I poured a drink making sure I had enough to last the night.\n\nFinally, I woke up one morning and said \"Phil, you are 100&amp;#37; functional.  Hangovers are nothing that a couple of pills don't fix.  You're doing great at your job.  You're wife doesn't care if you drink.  You my friend are an alcoholic.  You've always known alcoholics don't drink\".  I left the bedroom and told my wife I'm an alcoholic.  Her response?  \"We knew\".\n\nThat was 100 days ago.  Moderation is something I will never be able to do.  I will not drink with you today.  And it is always today.  Good luck to everyone on their journey.\n\nJust so people don't think it was easy.  I'll post a spreadsheet that I've kept for the last four years showing how many glasses of alcohol I've had each day.  I've been trying to quit for longer than four years.  Longest streak before now, 34 days.  Average streak zero days in four months then maybe a week off.  Giving myself the label of \"alcoholic\" did the trick for me.\n\nHere's the spreadsheet\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZnhemD2ubHoX5g3vfPrFwIxl4wfs0y4gtCrWRSNmXGY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZnhemD2ubHoX5g3vfPrFwIxl4wfs0y4gtCrWRSNmXGY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nKeep in mind that \"drinks\" were what went in the glass.  3oz of bourbon was 1 drink if it was a single glass.  I also didn't count \"swigs\" from the bottle.  But it does give an idea.",

   "selftext": "So I am almost at five sober months now, and on Sunday I started my 50th lap around the sun. The qualities of friends - from the brass monkeys through to the sterling true ones, are very much on my mind.\n\nWhen I was in the middle of drinking I had many of the kind of friends that themselves have serious drinking problems. I liked hanging out drinking with them. I never had to feel bad about having a hangover, talking shit all night, taking a tumble when I had the \"wobbly boot\" on... hey, we were ALL like that - breaking glasses, saying regrettable things, saying things like \"Oh I think I drink too much\" and telling each other \"no, you're fine\". I even had one drinking friend who is a therapist tell me that speaking doubts about my drinking being not such a great thing, was a sign I needed to love myself more, because drinking two bottles of wine a night is FINE. Yes, we were all FINE.\n\nUntil I wasn't anymore, and nothing those friends had to say made me feel fine.\n\nSo I put a lot of distance between me and those friends, and did a lot more talking to the friends that either don't drink at all, or drink seldom and don't binge when they do. \n\nOne of them is my oldest friend in the whole world. I've known her since I was 10 and she was 11. In the whole 35+ years we have known each other I have never been drunk with her, and she's never been drunk with me. There have been times we've had one or two... and I would actually stop at one, or two, and not feel the need of more. Most times we drink tea or water when we catch up. We both had our pot smoking phases, but during mine I went missing, more or less, for around 15 years. She missed me so much she got someone to track me down. And I've not gone AWOL since and moved back down where she was. She stayed my friend during this recent few years of heavy drinking, and not once did she condemn or condone, just listened. What ever choice I make about anything she says \"so how do you feel about that\" and \"how's that working for you\" or \"I can see that's working for you\". A friend like that, who has been there so steadfastly, is gold.\n\nAnother lady that I've known well for the past 8 years I've been in these parts if the kind of friend that thinks about what you might be needing, and then is there for that. She's also brilliant company. \n\nThis year for my birthday she suggested a trip to one of the nearest cities to see a band in a park - a free gig - and brought another friend into the plan, plus a variety of theirs and other people's kids to hang with mine. My oldest friend also came.\n\nThere was no drinking going on, everyone brought cheeses and crackers and soda water and other nice things. We got coffees.\n \nAt one point the other friend she brought along asked if I was still not drinking, and I said yes, and she said how great I'm looking, and all three of them came out with positives they'd noticed, including I seem happier, which I agreed, I am. \n\nI explained how I'd been using booze to self-medicate a slow-motion car crash of burnout after years of working too hard and handling a massive stress around my ex, sole parenting, the whole enchilada. And that the amount of booze involved just got way out of hand for too long, and I needed help to get over it - that's y'all here at SD - and never want to go back.\n\nMy dear friend the birthday organiser says suddenly, \"Oh! I remember you not being a drinker! I remember that you didn't used to drink, and I remember you telling me when you'd just discovered wine.\"\n\nTHAT is gold. The friends that remember who we were before we drank. The friends that celebrate that person coming back and also realise that we are not that exact same person - we are a new version of that person. The friends that notice if we look happier, or our eyes are sparkly, or if we are handling life in a different and positive way, they are gold.\n\nThe friends we can be absolutely honest with and do not have to feel shame around, because they have the ability to see the good person who made some bad choices. They are gold.\n\nThe friends that do not give up on us, that are willing to search for us even when we do not want to be found, and when they find us are just so GLAD to have us back in their lives, as my oldest friend was when she found me again, they are gold. And I gotta say, it is one of the greatest things to ever happen to me having this woman back in my life. Sometimes you don't even realise what a big hole there's been in yourself until you re-find the people whose friendship belonged in there.\n\nI'm not someone who gives a rats about how many friends I have on Facebook. I don't care what type of shoes my friends wear [and thank goodness, they don't care about what I wear either]. I don't care what car they drive, or what church they go to, or even if they don't go to church.\n\nIt is wealth beyond counting to have a few genuine, caring, wonderful friends in a life. People to laugh with, yarn with, imagine with, weep with, eat cheese with, compare scars with, trust hopes to and have faith in. \n\nThey can also be a really powerful support just because they are there, for making that daily decision, of not having the first drink. Because booze doesn't add anything valuable to friendships like that. And being present, fully and absolutely, sure does.\n\nI'm really looking forward to this 50th lap around the sun, AND doing it sober, because of the great companions I have sharing it with me.\n\nWishing everyone the blessing of true friendship. \nWhoopie xx\n\n\n  ",

I'm very proud of myself because it means I am no longer a 'drinker' by default.  It means I've consciously decided what I'm putting in my body and I have total control over it.  It makes me excited for the future because I know I don't have to be dependent on alcohol anymore.\n\nI feel guilty admitting this here but the first four weeks weren't that hard.... this time.  I've tried to quitting and moderation many times in the past few years but never had any success longer than a few days.  This time was different for many reasons but mainly, one simple (embarrassing) experience was an emotional turning point for me.  I work up the next morning motivated and determined more than ever to quit.  I finally admitted that moderation wouldn't work.  I admitted that I did have a drinking problem (though not an alcoholic - thanks to a timely post here for defining it for me).  I also accepted that it was ok to never drink again.  I visualized many future scenarios without alcohol and got comfortable that it would be ok to be sober in all of them.\n\nI'm glued to this sub and it has been one of the few, if only, places in my life where people understand what I'm going through and why.  My apologies for sometimes treating the sub like my diary but it helps.  \n\nI don't think I'll feel totally successful until I make it at least a year because there are so many cyclical events each year that always involved drinking for me.  I need to get through all of them to prove myself.\n\nIn my mind, the door isn't open to relapse.  I don't envision a scenario where I would drink again.  Though, I know it can happen at any time.  However, even if it does, the progress I've made isn't lost.  It's still worth it to have quit for however many days I end up quitting.  My life is unbelievably better in the last four weeks.  I've lost about 5% of my body weight.  My eyes have cleared up and are actually white now.  My skin has cleared up.  I sleep great for 7-8 hours a night and no longer take melatonin to get to sleep.  I'm engaged and motivated at work. \n I'm engage and motivated as a father and husband.  Nearly all aspects of life have improved and I can't identify a single negative that's resulted from quitting.\n\nI'm finally living my life to the fullest.  I'm no longer just getting through each day and using alcohol to zone out.\n\nI'm happy.\n\nThank you all for the help.",

I was still nervous, but less so! And I still had fun and got to practice non-intimate touch with women! And true to the tenets of exposure therapy lol, it really was easier the second time around. Nice!\n* [I got invited to *another* party!](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/8irz6z/small_success_i_got_invited_to_a_party/) But this time I didn't go because I felt like shit about myself.\n\n**Things That Didn't Work**:\n\n* I won't go into details, but at the tail end of last week, I had a minor quarter-life crisis (I hate that term, but it's fitting here) regarding my plans to go for a PhD^1. This had *serious* spillover effects on my energy to do everything else, and caused me to become much more withdrawn socially for a few days, contrary to what I was hoping would happen. \n* I drunk way more than I should have last Friday night: Two full bottles of wine. This happened mostly due to the stress that the aforementioned point put on me. That led to me sending out a ton of (mostly polite, thankfully) drunk texts to people, which I appreciate because it's good to keep an ember going with people, but **getting drunk is not the way to overcome social anxiety. This is a Very Bad Idea.**\n* As I said, I got invited to *another* party!...

Serious spillover effects.\n\n**Things I Want To Work On**:\n\n* ([Carry over from last week.](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/8jqaxg/early_20s_m_single_day_24_a_week_of_highs_and/)) Still sitting on a pile of Facebook messages I should respond to.

This is especially important if I'm going to be dating now, because I know that I can come on strong, and so I need to make even more of an effort to empathize and relate to the other person!\n* **New to this week:** I didn't carve out any time *specifically* to hang out and deepen relationships with the new friends I'm making this week. I'd like to me more intentional about that, especially since it can push me [away from using social messaging as a crutch and towards using it to plan IRL hangouts](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/8jqaxg/early_20s_m_single_day_24_a_week_of_highs_and/).\n* **New to this week**: I've known for a while I can be a problem drinker, but now, I think **it's time to get serious about my drinking**. I don't like making a fool of myself like that. I especially don't like the health problems it brings.\n* **New to this week**: I'm going to try to *stop doubting my career ambitions so often*, not because I don't have legitimate doubts, but because doubting it apparently has knockon effects to the rest of my life that conflict with my goal to become more sociable.

   "selftext": "My husband is an alcoholic. I\u2019ve been struggling with this for at least the past 10 years. We have one beautiful daughter together. I\u2019ve seen posts from people questioning what they can be doing, what they should be doing, how to help\u2026 all to make sense of their chaotic lives. Questioning if they are doing the right thing, searching for answers, feeling drained, defeated, and scared. This was me\u2026 this is me.\n\nThe first of this year I set boundaries with my husband. This was the first time I actually followed through. Ughhhh. It was so hard. Once, my daughter and I left for a couple days, then I had to ask him to leave our house two other times. As in, he moved out for months at a time because he wasn\u2019t respecting my/our boundaries. The stronger I became and more resolute in my decisions and boundaries, the harder he pushed back and the lower he sank. It was so difficult seeing him struggle and not helping him. That was my first instinct, but I held strong and stopped enabling him. I remembered what my boundaries were and that my well-being and my child\u2019s well-being needed to be my first priorities.  \n\nLong story short, he went to detox twice and finally agreed to do inpatient treatment. He is there right now. When we met with him this past weekend, I could see a glimmer in his eyes and the man that I fell in love with all those years ago. I can\u2019t say what will happen to our relationship or his recovery from this point going forward. I can only say that I feel hope. And strength. And peace.\n \nThere are three things that I can honestly say helped me the most. Therapy, boundaries and this message board. I went to a couple local Alanon meetings, but it just wasn\u2019t my \u201cthing\u201d. However, coming to this message board and reading every day was. Just lurking... not even posting! Gathering strength from others, knowing I wasn't alone. I got into therapy and have been seeing a counselor every week since October. My daughter will begin therapy in two weeks. Understanding boundaries has been soooo important for me. It\u2019s not about THEM. It\u2019s about YOU. Remembering who you were before you lost yourself in all the chaos of their addiction. Finding yourself again and respecting yourself. Finding confidence and strength in yourself to KNOW that you can do it\u2026 to enforce whatever your boundaries are. It\u2019s hard. But YOU are worth it.\n",

   "selftext": "I know there's probably a lot of posts about drinking dreams, and feel free to remove this if it isn't allowed, but I feel the need to type this all out.  \nLast night I had this crazy dream that started with me in a restaurant with some friends from elementary school.  \nIt's important to note my addiction issues started in grade 7 with pot and cigarettes, by grade 8 I was smoking both every day and drinking every once in awhile, and by grade 9 and 10 I had switched from pot to heavy daily drinking. (I literally had booze in my bag, in my locker, stashed at friends houses, multiple places in my room, you get the point).   \nAnyways, back to the dream. My elementary school friends were talking to me about how I turned into a completely different person and that I'm just not the kind of person who can handle recreational use of anything. I agreed with them, and then they started asking about my home life, which they all knew wasn't good, and just kept asking question after question about all my issues. I got increasingly upset and they were drinking right in front of me while asking about my problems. I didn't even really think, but I grabbed someone else's drink and downed it as fast as I could and they all just stared at me in shock. They started laughing and handed me drinks while \"joking\" that I was an alcoholic piece of shit. I got more defensive but just kept downing drinks.  \nI then \"blacked out\" in my dream, and \"woke up\" in my dream inside the gym of my elementary school. I was on the floor leaned up against the wall with my drink of choice in my hand. The gym was all set up for graduation, with all the chairs and decorations and all the awards set up on stage. I had the same feeling of nostalgia and sadness that I got when grade 8 grad was over. I really hate nostalgia and it was a very intense emotion. I walked up to the stage and sat on it, sipping from a bottle, looking out in the gym I gave the valedictorian speech from that I took a bunch of benedryl beforehand to calm my nerves. I always describe addiction as feeling like you're in a bubble of self pity and self destruction that is really hard to get out of, and it felt like I was back at square 1 in that bubble. It was a hella depressing dream that I'm having a hard time with. Thanks for reading that wall of text, IWNDWYT",

   "selftext": "I'm not sure how long this will be. I know my problems are small compared to others, but I have no way of getting a proper sense of things. Maybe I just want to vent, but I want to start at the closes to where I think my problems started so this will be long. I should point out that I am 32 male.\n\nI can't remember how old I was, but I know it was just before I went from Elementary school to Middle school. My dad was arrested and sentenced to prison. I wasn't told why at the time, but I eventually learned it was because he molested my sister.\n\nEven though he did what he did my mom still let him back into our lives. He is also an alcoholic so he was very abusive. His family always gave the excuse that he drank because he was in Vietnam.\n\nMy last year of Elementary school set the tone for the rest of my school life as that was when I started to get bullied, verbally mostly but sometimes physically. I was never a popular kid but I did have some friends that became bullies. In Middle school I was eventually involved in a fight that led to me getting punished for it.\n\nMy mom got a job as a manager of a motel when I left Middle school so we moved to another city where she to stay at the motels apartment. Where my dad moved in with us, my sister has long since moved in with her boyfriend.\n\nThe motel was located near a freeway with a bar right across the street from the motel. This led to my dad drinking alot more than he normally would, It was around this time I would start having the occasional suicide thought. We stayed there a few months before my mom asked to be placed at a motel that was not so close to a bar.\n\nWe moved to another city just in time to enroll me and my twin brother in High school. I was still bullied but not to the degree as I was before, a school shooting occurred the year before so I think people were hesitant about me. My older brother also moved in to this single room apartment with his girlfriend and 6 kids.\n\nOne day my dad is drunk and starts a fight with me and my brother. He pulls my hair and I fight back. My mom eventually get fired from this job.\n\nSeveral years later I'm out of High school and working at a warehouse. My sister has three kids with her now ex boyfriend and living with a new boyfriend. My dad recently got out of jail again and ends up working at the same warehouse I'm at and eventually with me. I eventually lose out on an office job for this company because he told the office after the asked him that I was not interested in that job.\n\nYears later It's just me, my twin brother, and my mom. Dad is in jail again and is getting out in a few months, I've been writing him telling him not to come live with us again, but I will give him some money to get a motel. Sister is living with her now husband, we are there to visit.\n\nEventually my mom starts to complain that she might have to let him back in just to make things easier with cash. Sister is opposed to this which leads to an argument where Sister asks \"Why did you let him back in after what he did?\" Moms answer \"Because these boys needed a father.\"\n\nEvery time things would work out well for us she would let him back in, and things would become hell again. So when she said that it turned into my fault that everything falls apart. That same day I got into an argument with her about that exact quote. I told her \"You are the one who has done everything, He has done nothing, so why do we really need him around?\" she didn't answer and kept deflecting.\n\nThe day comes when Dad gets out, he has the money I've been sending him. Our house consist of me, my twin brother, Mom, my Older brothers 3 kids. I have a well paying job, Twin is also working, Mom works at a new motel and collects SSI as guardian of my mentally challenged nephew. So we have enough to support us.\n\nThat night Twin gets a call from the police of the city Dad was dropped off in. Turns out instead of going to a motel he goes to stay with his cousin who he rarely gets along with. They get drunk and Dad gets thrown out. He goes to the old house of one of his deceased cousins and disturbs the new owner who politely gets him to leave. Dad is then attacked by a gang and severely beaten (Is it wrong that this makes me smile) and robbed.\n\nTwin tells mom about this and eventually leads to Dad moving in with us again. He then applies for SSI and gets approved for it. I lose my job but luckily get a new job quickly. Unfortunately the owner of the house sold it to someone who wanted us out. So we moved again and ended up losing Twins dog when she ran away while moving.\n\nOur new household now has Me, Twin, Mom, Niece, Nephew1, Nephew2, Cousin, and Dad. We are having items disappear and Cousin and Dad are blaming each other. I have been losing weigh which I have been trying to do, but also having bruises appear all over.\n\nI'm eventually hospitalized and diagnosed with a treatable form of leukemia. My mom has lost her motel job, so she is at least in a position to help me if I need. I'm able to go back to work, but another cousin asked to borrow my car one day so I was dropped off and need to wait to be picked up.\n\nDad is the one who picks me and Twin up, and he hits another car. Police are called my car gets impound and he is arrested. Getting my car out led to us having to use rent money which ends up putting us behind for the first time in 3 years of living there.\n\nI'm eventually fired and am stuck at home with Dad. Which eventually explodes into a fist fight after he made inappropriate comments to my niece. He is then leaves and I haven't seen him since. My older nephew and cousin cause problems which led to us being kicked out of the house.\n\nNiece, Nephew1, and Nephew2 move in with their mom. Me, Mom, and Twin move into a motel. Twin and Mom both have work until the end of the year when Mom loses her job. She decides to move in with her boyfriend who also lives in another city. Twin and I stay in the motel until he loses his job and we decide to move to the same city Mom lives in. Twin gets a job immediately, I have to get a new doctor to prescribe my medication, while also looking for a job that I never get.\n\nOne year later, Mom has an argument with her boyfriend and stays with us in his old trailer. He wants us out but his stuff is here so instead of just worrying about our stuff she wants to pack up his stuff first. I ask her why does she have to do his stuff he needs to get it himself. This leads to her blaming us for him being angry.\n\n32 years of all the anger I had for her not telling him no, finally came out. I told her how every time I had plans and money set aside to finally get out, she would ask me for some money to help her pay her car, phone, or whatever she needed, and how I would do it because \"I was not raised by HIM!\"\n\nNow she talking about living on the streets and I'm thinking \"I want out, I'm done.\" I'm tired of having everything I try to fix fall apart. I'm tired of everything blamed on me just because I don't have a job.\n\nArgument is done I'm sitting here typing, and as soon as Twin goes to work I will be left here alone. I'm tired of being the reason things go wrong. I don't want them to have a reason anymore.\n\nTLDR; 32 years have been harder on me than I thought.",

   "selftext": "I never talk about this. At all. So all you stranger's reading this, enjoy. \n\n\n\nMy parents drink. I don't know if it's enough for them to be considered alcoholics so I'm asking for advice. No one has labeled them as alcoholics. No one has told them they should slow down or quit. They don't do anything to stop. \n\nThey drink every night. There's usually always a drink before dinner. Then a few after. Together, they go through like two bottles of wine a night. That's after their usually martini. Wine, prosecco, margaritas, rum and coke, gin and tonic, you name it, they probably drink it. \n\nWhenever my mom accomplishes something physical, like doing yard work, she drinks a few beers. Understandable, she worked all day. But she's not allowed to drink beer. Or much alcohol. Her doctor put her on a diet of no carbs and if she wanted to drink, she could only have ONE glass of red wine. \n\nShe goes through bottles of wine when she's by herself. I don't know how much my dad drinks because he's always away on business trips.  \n\nMy mom has also started to I guess drink and drive. On three occasions, while I was in the car, she's had a beer before or while driving. Today she did the same thing. \n\nI know she can't get drunk on one beer but I mean, she already has a DWI. Both of my parents do. I was in the backseat of the car when they were arrested. \n\nDuring party's, they drink a lot. Yesterday at a city celebration they each downed like nine bottles of beer. That's after my grandfather's 70th birthday party where, after my grandparents left, they preceded to get drunk and come home at 3 am. \n\nJust a few years ago, my mom, aunt and uncles were eating dinner in town. I was exhausted and ready to go home. No one wanted to leave so they told me to suck it up because they wanted to have a few drinks. So I suck it up. 1am rolls around and we're the only ones awake in town. My mom is smoking with these guys on the street and my aunt is fighting with my cousin. My drunk uncle took me and my cousin home. My mom walked in at like 3 am and she didn't know where my aunt was. She had to call her dad at 2am to come get her in the middle of the night. \n\nThis probably sounds small to you guys but this shit has fucked me up. I can't sleep at night because I'm always thinking of this. And I have to bottle it up because I can't talk to anyone near me about this. No one stands up to this behavior because my parents tell me to shut up about it and not tell anyone. My brother doesn't even seem to care any more- which I mean, he shouldn't cause all this shit happens when I'm around. I want to tell my extended family but I can't because all it will do is cause a huge fight and at the end of the day, I'll still go home with my parents and my mom will make my life hell because she's a narcissistic asshole. \n\nI don't know what to do anymore because I'm just sad now. And whenever they drink, I don't give a fuck but when I see alcohol, with any one, I get all anxious and paranoid and I don't want to live my life avoiding places or people because I can't stand the sight of alcohol. \n\nIt's gotten to a point where I don't care what happens to them as long as it stops affecting me. I don't care if they get a divorce or kill each other, as long as I'm not there. \n\nI've brought their drinking up several times but my mom tells me it's none of my business and I shouldn't concern myself. Whenever I talk to my dad about it he just goes 'yeah, we should probably stop,' and then proceeds to open another bottle of wine and forgets all about it.\n\n My mother denies that they're alcoholics, that my grandparents are alcoholics (which they are, my grandfather goes through a bottle of rum like every two days; he's constantly drunk) and that they only like to drink cause it feels good. \n\nI feel so alone right now.

   "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nI have been lurking in this community for a few years now but have never really contributed outside of upvoting posts. I am writing this mostly for myself to document my feelings and journey, however I thought I would post it here. It is longer than I thought it would be, and I've omitted quite a bit. Here is my personal voyage through the mires of alcohol addiction.\n\nMy own personal journey with alcohol started about 10 years ago when I turned 19, legal age in my country. Before this, I had drank a bit at parties and whatnot but it was very minimal and almost not worth mentioning. My initial escapades getting to know the drink were a bit back and forth. I never saw it as a crutch I could lean on until after I went through a bad breakup in my early 20s. I started drinking more and more out of sheer loneliness and heartbreak and it snowballed from there without me realising just what I was doing and what was happening. It made me feel better (or so I thought at the time) when I needed something, anything to get me through it. This heartbreak did not last a few weeks or a few months, but years. \n\nThe next several years are a giant blur that mesh together to form some incoherent past. Chronologically my memories are scrambled and I sometimes have a difficult time piecing together the timeframe in which events happened. Day in and day out drinking, getting stoned and being a complete burnout with no aspirations or ambitions to better myself. Despite my earlier years of being a very outgoing, happy person - this person I had become was a complete contrast to who everyone around me knew me as growing up, particularly my family.\nIt was about 3 years after the breakup that started all this and the pain of it still clung to me like barnacles to a ships hull. I was unable to come to terms with it and accept it because I drowned my sorrows in a bottle every night rather than dealing with it directly. I had dated others during this time, but they were fleeting relationships that I probably shouldn't have been in in the first place, marred by my alcohol consumption and general lack of love for myself. During this time and mostly thanks to my parents who pushed me and supported me to get better, I managed to enrol in college and get a degree.\n\nThrough all of college I was still a drunken burnout but I graduated and came out with skills that I could actually apply to the real world and got a good job right out of the gate. After graduating was when I started to really look at myself and notice that something was wrong. I decided to quit smoking but I just could not give up the drink.\n\nI moved out of my familys house and into an apartment with a good friend. This transition was huge for me and I had big plans to moderate my drinking and aspire to become a person I could love. Long story short, that didn't happen. Within weeks I was drinking half a quart or more of rum a night and hiding bottles everywhere. Being very embarrassed about this addiction, I hoarded the empty bottles in my closet and hid them from view of anyone. Why I didn't just take the emptys and dump them in the recycle downstairs I don't know.. I had plans to, but the more I drank, the more the bottles accumulated and the more embarrassed I would be taking 24 dozen cases of beer down the stairs, the clang of shame. What I did not know at the time was after a while the empty bottles of beer and rum started to emit a smell that was noticeable as soon as you entered the unit. I could not tell as I was around it all the time. I only learned this after we had moved out and my roommate told me. I still feel bad about it to this day.\n\nI moved out on my own and am currently living alone. Once again I had big plans to curb my drinking and work on my sobriety. By this point I had tried 4 or 5 times to get sober but after a few days or weeks I fell right back off the wagon. I was reaching out for help but it was just not working, I had not yet reached my rock bottom..\n\nFast forward a bit, living alone, aspirations to cut back dashed again, drinking in full swing. Hiding bottles, not wanting to carry cases of beer and full bags of empty rum bottles downstairs to the recycle for fear of other tenants seeing me and judging me. I started seeing someone who I really fell for and would make my heart skip when they were around. Someone who had not made me feel like this since the relationship that I described earlier. Things were going great, then they fell apart, not without the help of my old 'friend' alcohol. 'Not again' I thought..\n\nThis all sent me into an even deeper spiral of depression and drinking that I could not get out of alone. I vividly remember my last night of drinking. Feeling lonely and depressed, I was polishing off a bottle of rum at 3am and stumbled into a pile of boxes, falling on my ass. 'What the hell am I doing'.. 'what is happening to me'.. I blamed my alcoholism for another failed opportunity at a happy life. These thoughts were running through my head and at that moment something clicked... Something that I can't explain fully, I don't know exactly what it was, some kind of voice that was in my head that had been drowned from years of drinking telling me to get up and fix myself before I end up worse than I already am.\n\nI woke up the next day, signed into this site and requested my badge. This is I believe my 6th or 7th attempt to be sober, but something feels different now. There is a fire in me that refuses to go back to those days. Today, this is the longest time I've been sober in 10 years and I have no intention of letting that go. Gutting my place of empty bottles and cans felt incredible, like I was throwing away my old self and beginning fresh. That person may be gone, but the memories will remain as a reminder of where I came from.\n\nI am now sleeping much better, eating better, have an exercise regime that I enjoy doing. I am performing much better at my job. I've lost at least 10 pounds and my face and skin are much clearer. I still have a long way to go to find myself once again, but every day that I don't drink is a victory. \n\nThank you SD for giving me an outlet to help me realise that I am not alone in my journey, and inspiration to continue on this path. It's not without hard work, I've learned stopping drinking isn't some magical thing that will suddenly make all aspects of life better instantly. It takes time and effort, and I still have my down days but I'm learning to cope with them in a healthy way.",

But I just graduated and am moving cities within the month so I wont be at home where he can continue to hide his habits. My question is, is there any information, tips, wisdom, or books i can read to help educate myself about how to provide the help he needs and understand what he's going through?

I started on Friday night with a friend of mine, it involved moonshine and went until sun-up. I followed that up with a brunch to get rid of the hangover which went until that night. I don't recall all the events of the night but here's the breakdown the next morning.\n\n*  Right hand severely bruised because I got made and punched a concrete wall.\n* My scale (glass Fitbit kind) lies shattered on my floor, apparently I dropped a bottle on it.\n* Place was trashed with beer cans/bottles everywhere (party was four people but it looked like a parade of people were here).\n* Numerous hazy memories of making an ass of myself.\n* Got into an angry exchange with one of my best friends because he was worried about me and my health, which I apparently took issue with.\n\nI pissed away a full 24 hours of a long weekend, and the entirety of the day after nursing my headache, apologizing to my friends and feeling sorry for myself. I *used to* drink just to be social, as time went on I did it to stop overthinking things - eventually I stopped thinking entirely.\n\nI have no idea why I'm posting all of this; I think if I put my mind  in text form I will be less likely to do it again. My friends strangely enough are not *nearly* as bothered by my behavior as I am, which I think is one of two lessons I need to consider after this event.\n\nThanks for reading, I intend to continue on this new course of mine but I'm far from hopeful. This self-pity thing is something I need to fix, I don't know if I need people to commiserate with or a kick in the ass at this point. \n\n**TL;DR** went on a bender, fucked up a lot, taking drastic action to make sure it doesn't happen again\n\n**EDIT** I am in awe of the support from this sub, generally with Reddit it's minefield.

I'm currently on probation until March, 2019 for the DUI, Disorderly Conduct and Resisting Arrest. I took a plea deal otherwise I could've taken the case to trial and risked going to prison for 2-4 years because I hit the K9 and spit on it after it bit me, which is assault and dispensing bodily fluids on an officer.\nI got one year probation and waived my right to sue the police department for excessive use of force. I feel I made the right choice even though there was no need for the K9 to bite me and scar me for life. The police bodycam footage was played during my sentencing and the 6 officers had me restrained enough.\n\nSince I'm on probation I can't drink, and AA doesn't help me because I don't want to hear other people's same stories when I have enough problems of my own. I can't afford rehab, and I just want to stay sober for good and that's why I'm reaching out to this subreddit and spilling my guts about my problems. \n\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. \n\n",

My mother was an alcoholic before her death, my entire family stopped speaking to me apart from four members and I dealt with depression for years before. All my heroes died too, because I found out they were assholes. I used to be highly suicidal but then it stopped. The thoughts have come back and now they're so loud that I can't ignore them anymore. I've tried and tried. Everything just hurts. My head tells me to do really bad things to myself, but the rest of the time it tells me all the ways I can take my life. I've tried to get help over and over, but nothing works. Every therapist I had just stopped returning my calls for appointments and my medication doesn't work. Now I'm just tired of trying. I don't want to anymore. I don't want to hate everything about myself, feel like I'll never be enough for anyone or just want to disappear. I want it to end. I've always known I was going to die by suicide, because I think I always knew nothing would ever get better for me. It's a good thing for me to go, because I'm not a good person. I'm selfish and wimpy and pathetic. If I don't do it now, I'll only do it in a few years. Thoughts about my family and friends grieving doesn't scare or upset me because they'll get over it. They'll find somebody else to fill the hole I left, which wouldn't be very big because I doubt I leave much of an impact. I've seen how death works and now I know that people eventually get over it. Anyone who has died, I can't remember their voices or faces, or any memories of them and it doesn't hurt. It'll be the same. I know it's selfish not to care, but I don't because I know they'll be okay. I hold them back anyway. I've tried talking to both my family and friends. My family doesn't listen or understand. They don't want to talk about it. The one thing I've found with talking to people, for me, is that it helps for a day or two and then I just want to die again. It used to scare me out of doing it. When I was younger, I talked myself out of committing over and over by reminding myself that it would kill my loved ones and so I promised myself I'd do it once everyone else was already dead but now I know how much better they would be without me. I also used to imagine my life in ten years, but now it's ten years later and I'm still the mopey depressed kid who has nothing. I know how I'm going to do it. I want everything to stop. Everybody always says that depression leaves them empty, but it doesn't do that to me. It's constant chronic pain. This life hasn't been good to me and I haven't been good to it, so I want to make some room for somebody who will appreciate it more than I ever did. The pathetic thing is that I don't even want to get better, I just want to go. I'm not really sure why I'm posting this. I don't just want to stop the pain, I want to stop existing. I want to be nothing. I'm sorry for posting this and I'm sorry for putting this onto whoever might read this. It's not your job to save me, especially when I don't want it, but I needed to get this out. I'm sorry.",

I think my blood sugar is whacked as well.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've worked my way down to about 7.5 units a night before this journal starts.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n(alcohol units (abv*l, pint of heineken = 2.5 units), sleep the night before, resting heart rate)\n  \"restless\" means I'm literally just rolling around all night and sleep tracker can't register any sleep\n  no deep means sleep tracker registers sleep but it's all light / rem\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMonday (5, 7.25 hours, 65bpm)- went to work, panicked at subway, got off after 1 stop, paced around, but continued to work.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTuesday (5, 7.0 hours, 65bpm) - going to work, panicked on the subway, went to work, panicked around 4 pm and ran home (this has happened multiple times now, I carry around gatorade, convinced I have blood sugar problems, which may be true).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWednesday (5, 6.75 hours, 65bpm) - panicked on subway for the third day in a row, this is not okay, went home, didn't get to work. Panic was an intense feeling of sleepiness, like, \"I could just pass out on the sidewalk here, I might not be able to stop myself\" at 8AM.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThursday (5, 5.5 hours, 67bpm) - Didn't bother trying for work. Had a black tea right when I woke up, proceeded to have a pleasant 4 hour long panic attack, laying on the bed regretting not emailing mum more often kind of thing with Bob Ross on in the background (god bless you Bob Ross, you never judge me), really dark. This happened to me a few weekends ago when I had 3 strong coffees on an empty stomach. *This is the day I quit caffeine.* Watched \"Star Trek: TNG\" (1987)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFriday (6.5, 6.75 hours, 66bpm) - stayed home, ***day I decided I _needed_ to quit***, not just cut back, anticipated taking next week off, planned quit day Wednesday (continuing tapering with 2 days at a 500ml of wheat beer, 2 days at a 330ml of lager). *Today was the last cigarette* (I still have a vaporizer with 3 mg, the lowest concentration, liquid). Not so funny story, there is a piece of paper on the floor next to my cig smoking window that says \"please stop,\" it's been there for months. Headache from no caffeine I think. Watching \"Columbo\" (1971). This is the last good night sleep I will get for a while.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSaturday (2.5, 8.5 hours, 67bpm) - relatively okay day, lots of gatorade. Did some research about quitting alcohol, good to know that literally every single site says I need a hospital and a social support network; not an option, so that really helps my confidence. WikiHow, the most useless site on the internet, gave me some helpful hints for quitting like \"make new friends\" and \"pick up a hobby.\" Thanks WikiHow, I just laid on the floor for 30 minutes and had 5 showers today, making new friends seems like solid, actionable advice. \"Hi, I'm Bob, would you like to stare at the wall and think about kidney failure with me?\" Watching \"Kolchak\" (1974).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSunday (2.5, 7.5 hours sweats restless, 67bpm) - panic, especially after meals. Convinced I am hypoglycemic and chugging gatorade. Then convinced I am hyperglycemic and chugging water. With these two professional diagnoses, I now know that I am diabetic and will probably die here on the floor if the hepatitis doesn't get me first. Metallic taste in mouth is either diabetes or a seizure according to google. Last night is the least I think I've ever drank on purpose, seem to be psyching myself out about the whole ordeal. Brutal headache, I think from no caffeine. Watching \"The Outer Limits\" (1963).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMonday (1.4, 7.0 hours sweats, 67bpm) - Soft panic (ringing in ears, focus on ringing in ears, start thinking about cancer, ringing becomes a roar, etc.), just after meals, half hour or so at a time. Headache when I shake my head. Writing is shit today, nothing is flowing, really forced. Not pleased with \"1 beer a night\" schedule. *Today was the last alcohol*. Watching Terry Pratchett film marathon all day, \"Going Postal\" (2010) is great.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDay 1\nTuesday (0, 8.5 hours sweats restless, 67bpm) - Soft panic, mostly after meals. Today told boss I was out for the full week. Have beers available in house because I'm scared of DTs, fight with myself over having today's beer because my planned quit day is tomorrow, don't drink it and start a day early, hooray me. Actually is not too hard to go to sleep early. Headache when shaking head. Watching \"Tales from the Crypt\" (1989) all day.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSide note: I'm trying to walk 10000 steps every day, usually about an hour and a half after lunch. I generally feel great after these walks.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDay 2\nWednesday (0, 6.5 hours no deep, 66bpm) - no panic (not feeling good, just never feel like \"I might actually die right here in the middle of the road\"), housecleaning (half-assed), laundry. Depressive thoughts have replaced \"oh shit I'm dying\" thoughts. Throwing myself at writing with a passion, don't anticipate restful sleep, so exercising tons. Reading about DTs \"suddenly\" popping in 48-72 hours after the last drink, spiking my own bpm to 90 and arguing with self about having a medicinal brew. Reading literally anything else and it drops to 75 bpm. Resist drinking brew. TV was a bit cheeky and had a little bit of a mutiny not working properly, I was completely reasonable and shouted at it for half an hour until it got back in line. Watching \"Dirk Gently\" (2010) and \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" (1981) BBC shows.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSide note: I scrapped the chicken dinner idea and seared two massive tuna steaks and just cavemanned them with my hands and some wasabi.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDay 3\nThursday (0, 7.3 hours 1.5 hours deep!, 66bpm) - I was wrong, I slept so good last night. like stupid goodly, first night I don't spend an hour awake at 3AM, first night I can stay in bed past 5AM (sunrise / birds). Checking now, I got 1.5 hours deep sleep, this is the most deep sleep for the entire journal so far. Still sleepy on waking, but staying up to keep schedule. World is still strange to me, feel dazed (can \"focus in\" on that feeling of not-rightness to start panic feeling, but can also back away from it), exercising when feeling some mental discomfiture. Happy with exercise soreness. Difficulty focusing on writing. Picked up the \"please stop\" paper and am doodling on it. Definite paunchiness in stomach, probably from the military grade arsenal of fiber I've been shoving in. Want to drink tonight, not for \"DTs health reasons,\" just know that 1 beer will make all the \"not-rightness\" anxiety go away. Didn't drink. Watching \"Zulu\" (1964), \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962), \"Spartacus\" (1960).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSide note: Writing is really carrying me through this. Daily, I'm writing flash fiction on /r/writingprompts which is a nice distraction. I'm also working on a compilation of short stories. For the months before now, I've had one sentence ideas. Developing these is helpful for the hours spent rolling in bed (don't expect this problem to go away, I have had sleep problems since childhood, unfortunately), much easier to not think about trying to sleep but instead using it as \"work time.\" Exercise and cleaning are very psychologically helpful.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDay 4\nFriday (0, 8 hours restless, 66 bpm) - Damn, back to restlessness and sweats at 3am and 5am. I think today is probably the longest I have gone dry in a decade; before, the longest I would go would be an international flight + maybe a hotel w/o liquor on one end so like 28+24 hours maybe. Getting powerful depressive pangs of loneliness, I remember these, they aren't friendly. Very sleepy, not in a great place, writing is shitgriping today, I write humor, not shitgriping.  Feel much better after couple hours walk. *Today was the last nicotine*. Watching Disney all day, 1976 \"Freaky Friday\" is best \"Freaky Friday,\" fight me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSide note: When I'm writing, I'm listening to The Grateful Dead and Phish mostly. Difficult to overstate how calming this is.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDay 5\nSaturday (0, 6.5 hours 1 hour deep, 64bpm!) - Depressive pangs early. Slept well, but woke up earlier than I wanted. Today I'm going to go buy and switch from 3mg vape fluid to 0mg vape fluid because blowing smoke rings helps me relax at night, but I think the nicotine isn't helpful just before bed. Also out of protein powder, so, have lots of stuff to go out and do today. Looking forward to trying the subway and interacting with people (anxiety just before going out, melts away by the time I get to the subway). Check that resting heart rate drop tho, looks like my body is registering the drop in poison intake. My best RHR is like 60 bpm, when I was being active, my worst is like 77; on a bender I can pump it up about 2bpm a day. Brain fog feels like I'm on really shitty weed, just kind of slow / hazy / forgetful / anxious with none of the nice body or cerebral sensations -- apparently this feeling will be the next few months of life? Anyways, it's not so bad compared to the panic, another teenage version of me used to hunt this sensation down. Went and got the whey powder and then had a setback when the first vape shop  went to had no 0mg juice and needed to take a much longer detour into the wild (vaporizers aren't super commonplace here), everything went fine, but missed my lunch shake and had an emergency gas-staion juice instead, sorry blood sugar. Today I am finally experiencing relief. Feel in control, but having difficulty paying attention to stuff like audiobooks. No more headache when I shake my head. Watching \"Night Moves\" (1975), \"Insomnia\" (2002), \"Laura\" (1944).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSide note: I take ice cold showers in the morning, I highly suggest this. First it's invigorating, second, when you start your day immediately with something _optional_ that's just uncomfortable and unnecessary, I think it puts you into an obstacle tackling state of mind.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDay 6 Sunday (0, 7 hours 1.5 hours deep, 64 bpm) - Woke up too early again, I think I need to move my bedtime early another hour (I'm already 2 hours earlier than when I was drinking) because what is wrong with these fucking birds. Planning another big trip today to the distant supermarket, two days in a row on long subway trips, should be fine for work tomorrow. Had a sore throat the past few days, seems gone now. Trip to far store went fine. Then after lunch went for a long walk w/o my emergency gatorade in a secluded place and started panicking (30 minutes to get home at the quickest). Not great... Something's wrong in my guts, no nicotine, I'm like a balloon with no blood sugar... Did get new bedtime beverages though: licorice mint tea (literally the only uncaffeinated tea they had) and soda water. Cleaned and oiled my knives, did a teardown cleaning of my fountain pens. Watching \"The Basketball Diaries\" (1995), Kelly's Heroes\" (1970).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDay 7 Monday (0, 6 hours 1 hour deep, 65 bpm T.T) - goddamnit, wanted to go to sleep at 9 but didn't go to sleep till 1o.3o because some person got me into a conversation about politics and kept having fucking wrong opinions; and every time I kept trying to go to sleep it just sounded like I was angry and abrupt or whatever so I kept the conversation going way too long. Now I'm up like clockwork at 5.3oAM and no sleep and not in a great place to go to work (commute is 50 minutes 1 way) after surprise episode yesterday and fuck fuck fuck. Need a new rule for now about no phone past 9. I was intensely tired yesterday, and now I'm already tired at 8AM. I think I'm going to aim for a 7pm pass out tonight... Watching \"And Then There Was One\" (1945, 2015).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDay 8, end notes (IWNDWYT, 8.5 hours 1 hour deep, 65 bpm) - yes. going to sleep at like 9 was a great idea. I still feel like a space cadet, but I'm doing work and pushups and writing and reading and walking and not just sitting in bed listening to Bob Ross paint mountains. So seems like we're on the up and up, just going to be foggy a few weeks / months. I think the panic has definitely grown less, but still a lot of work to do.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat I am eating:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMorning / Lunch: 1 cup oatmeal, 1 banana, 1 yakult probiotic shot, 1 scoop whey protein, 1 huge spoon peanut butter, fill with almond milk.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDinner: absurd amounts of veg, tons of asparagus, squash, onion, tomato, salad, beets, cheese, peppers, chicken.\n  initially basically no carbs. Feel like blood sugar is out of whack because I'm usually getting 1500 calories of wheat beer, so on Tuesday I began adding in about a can of chickpeas per meal. I am trying to eat devastatingly huge meals in the evening to make me sleepy. Scale is broken, so no clue how this is playing out.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEvery meal: Ogre Juice - shotglass with ~2 cloves garlic, turmeric, black peppercorns, apple cider vinegar. This will get you right, I swear by it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf feeling nauseous - home-pickled ginger is a lifesaver.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCentrum multivitamin in the morning (I think the B vitamins keep me up at night). Melatonin at night, I think it's 500 mcg, but I'm not sure because the label is messed up and says 500 mg, which is an insanely brutal dosage and can't be right.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDrinking like 4-5 liters of lemon water a day. My teeth are _not_ enjoying it. Worried about electrolytes, so drinking a lot of miso soup as well. I stopped the gatorade because of blood sugar concerns, I still carry it \"for emergencies\" when I go walking.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've finished one week, that seems like a reasonable thing to have accomplished, but I'm going to go ahead and commit to a month, see how this plays out. The last 2 days of the taper were really rough for me, the seriousness of \"this is the end\" kind of kicked in with none of the accomplishment of \"I didn't drink today\". Days -2 (last 2 of taper) to 4 (after taper) were hell, I write it kind of comically, but when I joke about \"I guess I'll just die on the floor\" that's literally what was going through my head and it wasn't funny at all. I just kept remembering myself from 10 years ago, before this shit, and how cool I was. And I kept thinking about the last years and how boring I was, literally just running home to watch reruns (this particularly pisses me off, not even watching something new 90% of the time) with a couple of bottles of wine and no dinner so it would kick harder, going to the gas station at 2 in the morning because the 6 pints I'd already had weren't knocking me out, whole days spent in bed swearing off booze until I could walk at 4pm and went to get a couple to take the edge off so I could quit tomorrow. Always tomorrow. I thought about a lot more shameful stuff that I'm not going to go into, things that brush against my memory and just send jolts of adrenaline-fueled shame through me. It's like being the butt of a joke but not realizing it, at first I was laughing along but then I got the joke and I got angry (not at first, at first I just stared into the mirror and cried a little for a few years, this time getting angry was what I needed). I've demolished relationships with people who treated me better than my best friend alcohol. Is it all better today? Fuck no. But It sure won't be worse tomorrow if I can help it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThanks SD, IWNDWYT",

Throwaway. \n\nI've been drinking predominately every night for a few years now, and before that it was a couple of nights a week of \"I'll just have one drink\" turning into many. I'm so tired of managing my mornings and how I will feel. Every time I get a buzz I tell myself, \"you can stop this! You don't have to spend so much time managing this habit to function\", but then I fall into the same pattern night after night. I've tried to stop drinking quite a few times. I know how much better I feel emotionally and physically when I'm sober. Instead I tell myself things like, \"I'm still young, I'm okay for now\". Alcohol abuse has been an ongoing problem in my family. I cared for my father as his liver failed and I was there at his death bed in 2012 when he passed. Somehow this hasn't been enough to make me stop. I'm on day one and this journey feels so overwhelming. Most people in my life aren't aware that this is a struggle for me (as far as I know). I want to be the person I was before this addiction. I recently had labs done that show my kidneys and liver are not functioning as they should be and my PCP is aware of my alcoholism. I am also seeking a therapist to help manage my emotional stability as I stop drinking. I work in clinical psychology and I see many patients that are dealing with this - I feel like a phony when I give recommendations to manage alcohol use disorders.  I want to be better and take my own advice.\n\nI will not drink with you today.",

I am not sure what I could do to stop romanticizing a case of beer or certain liquors. As I am doing this I hear my brain go over an incident that is embarrassing or I start debating myself as to why it is or isn't worth it to me. It is like the angel/devil thing is really existing on my shoulders. I think I have, at some point, stopped actively caring about how this makes me feel or why I am doing it. Part of me just wants to stop thinking about it altogether and ignore it at all. It is like I don't want the term alcoholic to apply to me. I don't want to identify myself that way mentally. I just want to skip ahead and be \"normal\" \\(or better\\) again. Or maybe I just don't want to admit it so I can leave the window open. It seems to be that drinker's dream of \"one day\" on repeat. I keep finding myself being crazy frustrated with things I shouldn't even be frustrated with. I am having to work super hard to control my emotions.

   "selftext": "I have an addictive personality.  When I got into middle school, I found myself quickly overtaken by my desire to avoid my problems all day through games.  I started to get poor grades because all I wanted to do was game.  My parents tried to curb it, but only could hold me off for a few years.  When I reached high school, I ended up taking on easier classes because my grades were suffering, because I wouldn\u2019t take the time to do the work honors and AP courses demanded of me.  I procrastinated the hell out of my basic responsibilities, and spent most of my high school life grounded for it to play video games.  This gave me plenty of time to sit at home and just play video games.  By the time my parents learned to start taking the tv out of my room, I was far too depressed too care.  I just sat around and played video games on my phone, or streamed video game commentary.\n\nI attended college for 3 years, and the amount of freedom was more than I could handle.  I did what I had to to get by in the classes I didn\u2019t care for, and was barely any better in the ones I did.  All my free time; video games.  Around the time I turned 21, my dad explained to me that his father was an alcoholic, and he wanted me to be aware of my illness to save me from falling into it.  Would\u2019ve been nice to know sooner, but at least he tried.  That\u2019s as loving as a person can be right?  To try.  Guess they were in denial about the gaming, can\u2019t blame them, I was too and I often found myself arguing with them about it.  Not long after, I was dropped out of most of my classes for lack of attendance, or because I was failing.  Guess why I wasn\u2019t attending my classes.\n\nI got help.  I kicked the habit, and last year I really started to make progress towards getting to a better place.  I hadn\u2019t had drinks very often; when I was almost 22 I finally decided I was ready to handle that responsibly.  Not long after, life threw me a curve ball and I went full blown alcoholic for an amount of time I can\u2019t recall, maybe a month; but it got sorted out and I quit cold turkey for the woman I loved.  She\u2019s not around anymore, and life just got really stressful for me.  When I was drunk, I didn\u2019t care about anything, so none of my pain bothered me.\n\nSo right now, living pretty close to an arcade that also serves alcohol, I\u2019m feeling pretty tempted to relapse.  I want to not care about my problems again, or the damage I am having or have caused to my life; I want to be able to distract myself from everything by focusing on a high score or a new adventure.  Beer tastes so good.\n\nI\u2019d never drink and drive, that\u2019s one of the crazy weird hang ups that\u2019s helped give me strength, but I can feel that it won\u2019t be enough if I don\u2019t get support.  It\u2019s way too serious of a consequence for me to risk going unchecked, so I\u2019m here.  I can feel it, if I keep this bottled up, I won\u2019t care about drinking and driving.  On top of it, I\u2019m already struggling to stay off video games and sort my life out.\n\nFunny, the other day I was too sad to play, but as soon as I\u2019d vented about being sad about it I went back to playing.  Idk, just, does somebody have some advice?  I\u2019m going to counseling soon, I did an intake, and I\u2019m just waiting on a call back for my first session.  I\u2019m just worried about how long that will take and if I\u2019ll make it.",

This weekend  a former co-worker went on a bender, kidnapped his girlfriend, beat her up, and shot himself. He survived and is in the hospital, under arrest for multiple felonies.

He was clean cut, articulate, a former Marine, qualified for the job... an ideal candidate. Background check totally clean, not so much as a traffic ticket. Over the course of the next month, I'm responsible for training him. A couple of mornings I thought I smelled alcohol on his breath, but I was never sure and he didn't seem impaired so I just brushed it off, thinking maybe it was mouthwash or something. \n\nThen, one day he's working in the field at a customer site with my other colleague, who calls me to report that the new guy appears to be drunk. When they get back to the office, I sit down with him and he isn't obviously impaired, maybe a bit off. He seems to know something is up and apologized, saying that his cold medicine is making him a bit woozy. I said okay,  take the day off tomorrow and rest, come back when you're feeling better. That was last Tuesday.\n\nWednesday, he comes to work clearly intoxicated. I call my boss (the CEO) and he is fired. He leaves, we wonder what the hell happened-- he seemed so straight laced until now. We shrug, figure he must be an alcoholic, exchange thoughts about how sad that is for a young, smart veteran, and move on. \n\nSaturday, his shit hit the fan. Now all I can think about is how easily that could've been me. He knows I'm the one who got him fired. What if he had decided to come back on Wednesday, or the rest of the week? There's nothing but glass between my office and the sidewalk. He could've shot me from the parking lot and been gone before my co-workers even knew what happened. We had zero inkling that he was remotely capable of the things he's being accused of. We suspected an alcohol problem, but that's a far cry from the drastic domestic violence he committed. \n\nTLDR: I'm rattled that someone I was working with so closely could turn out to be a monster, and that it could have easily been me that was targeted. It's irrational (because he's currently in police custody at a hospital and not likely to be released), but I don't feel comfortable in my office and feel very exposed. Advice please?",

   "selftext": "\nI'd like to hear everyone's opinions in regards to this question. But first, I'll give my own.(note that this is only my opinion and by no means is meant to undermine anyone else's, it's simply meant to start a conversation). The DSM-5, which I believe is the most up to date diagnostic representation of psychological disorders states that addiction is indeed a disease(I may be wrong here, this was just what we used when I was in college). I haven't poured through the data myself, but nonetheless, it's in there. Here's my problem, stating that addiction is a disease gives us another reason to justify our using of our DOC. It's true that those with an addiction DO have mental and physical processes that exacerbate the using of drugs (anxiety, depression, pain, fear), to name a few. Also, there are brain scans that show that addicts do have different patterns than those of non-users. Yet, as far as I know, and based off of all the research I've done, there aren't any studies that show that those particular patterns exist PRIOR to the addiction taking place. Of course, anxiety and depression can be the reason someone might turn to drugs, but isn't that the disease? Yes, we know that there are certain genes that can be inherited that make one more likely to become an alcoholic for example, this has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. BUT, these recessive genes aren't expressed unless they are turned on. Can't the argument be made that these expressions are simply a result of environment? For example, if a person had the alcoholic gene, if that person lived in a place where alcohol was never available, they wouldn't ever become an alcoholic. As an ex-addict(opiates), it always bugged me when the therapist would say \"firstly, let me tell you that what you have is a disease\". It seems like a cop out, like a way to tell yourself and others that what happened to you wasn't your fault. I never wished to become and addict, growing up I never even considered becoming an addict was a possibility, yet, like so many others, it happened. But it's not like one day I just woke up and needed to go get some heroin, it was a long process. Maybe it's more that some of us just have that little switch in our brain that makes it more difficult to quit things, an addictive personality as some might call it. But having an addictive personality doesn't directly result in addiction, again, i feel it's a result of the environment we live in. A disease can be something we're born with, a disease can be something that one day we wake up with. Indeed, environmental factors CAN cause diseases(one can be more hereditarily prone to skin cancer for example, yet if they don't go in the sun too often it won't ever happen). Although I'm ashamed of it, I believe that my addiction was entirely my fault. I wasn't in a bad place at the time, in fact, I was at one of the highest points of my life. I had just finished college, I had a great job and was making tons of money. Having all that money allowed me to get all the drugs I wanted, and mainly, I just enjoyed the feeling of getting fucked up. I loved LSD (any entheogens actually), ketamine, every pill I could get my hands on, alcohol, weed, actually I can't really think of a drug I didn't like and I've nearly tried them all( I know there are a shit ton of new RC's that I haven't tried, so many I don't think anyone's tried them all), but you catch my drift. I just think us addicts need to take responsibility for our actions in every single form we can, without putting the blame on anything else. Whether addiction is a disease or not, and it very well may be, it's our job to see why we do what we do. Telling ourselves that we have a disease simply makes it easier to tell ourselves \"I can't quit\", \"I have a disease, and it's the disease that's eating at me\", \"it's not all my fault, my grandpa was an alcoholic too\". We already have enough excuses and justifications, \"I'm hurt and this helps\", \"I just do it for fun\", \"I'm not worth shit anyway, so why quit\"?. What do you guys/gals think? Is there any reason that we should continue to tell ourselves we have a disease, or is this just another justification? Please keep it nice everybody, I know this can be a touchy issue and I'd really love to hear everyone's opinion. If you believe it is a disease, can you elaborate a bit as to why? If not, what do you believe brought you to the point of addiction? Thanks for reading, and I value all opinions. Much love, PassiveTactics\n\nShareComment",

   "selftext": "Hi. This is a fresh account to protect my identity. I'm too embarrassed to post under my name under fear my friends might see.\n\nI live a life mainly disconnected from other people. A life full of secrets. I do have friends. Most of my real life friends have moved on and started their own families. I've made several new online friends from running online communities. I rent a room in my mothers house. I spend about 90% of my time in my room. This is the only space in this house where I feel welcome. \n\nI'm also disabled. I don't seek pity for being disabled. But it's an important factor in today's post. The house I live in is not designed for me. It is not tailored to my needs. I use a power chair to get around. The doorways to the bathroom are too narrow for my chair to get inside. So..... Of course I'm human like the rest of you. I have to use the restroom just like anyone else. \n\nHere's where things get questionable. If you're easily grossed out by anything. Please close this post.\n\nI have to handle my bathroom business in my room. Number 1's and 2's. You'll have to use google if you don't know what these numbers mean. I'll be referring to these numbers to not be graphic.\n\nWhenever I need to use the restroom. I have to be in my room. Because it's the only place in the house where I have any privacy. Since I'm in a chair sitting down. I use a handheld urinal for number 1's. Now of course I need a way to dispose of my waste. I use empty drink bottles to store it. Any empty water or soda bottle gets used. I do not keep these stockpiled in my room. I usually use old shopping bags for trash. I can fit 4 bottles in a bag before I take it outside to the dumpster. I double tie the bags so the contents don't fall out. The bags I use are darker in color, so people won't see the contents when I take them out. \n\nNumber 2's I dread. It's a huge hassle. I use those large absorbent pads you see in hospitals or clinics. They sell smaller versions as \"puppy pads\". I pretty much lay down a pad. Do my business, bag it up, and take it out immediately. I have to work fast to avoid stinking up the joint. \n\nNow that the worst part is out of the way. Let's talk about the rest of my room.\n\nI spend most of my time in my chair.... all of it actually. I don't sleep on my bed. My bed doesn't work for me. I can't easily move my self around or sit up easily if I need. It's a full sized bed. I need something to hang on to for leverage to move myself around. My bed does not have rails or anything for me to hang on too. If I lay down and eventually have to use the restroom. I cannot sit up in time, that can lead to accidents. Which has happened. My bed is mainly used as a place for my clothes. I don't own a dresser, so I have nowhere else to put them. I cannot use my closet because of the narrow doorway. I also keep other things at the foot of the bed. Like snacks, sealed bottles water or soda. I keep them in my room so the rest of the house doesn't eat/drink all my stuff. As a result. My bed is cluttered. It doesn't look as bad as pics I've seen. But it isn't tidy. \n\nMy power chair has a tilt system with an air filled seat cushion. The cushion plus the tilt system is excellent against pressure sores. I don't have a single sore from always being in my chair. \n\nI live on disability or ssi. Most of these problems could be fixed if I had the money. I simply can't afford a custom built house for myself. I can't afford a special bed for myself. I have to make due with what I have. I'm NOT begging for money just to clarify. I just see other disabled folks with cool gear for their homes. They don't have to worry about simple things like I do. If I had all that stuff, I wouldn't have these problems. \n\nI know what some people might say. They'll say \"Get a nurse to come help you.\" or \"Go live in assisted living.\" or \"Ask your family for help.\"\n\nI have issues with these suggestions.\n\n1: If I just get a nurse in here to help me. I'm terrified they'll take 1 peek at my room and have me hauled off to some care living facililty... Like an old folks home. I value my freedom and independence too much to do that.\n\n2: The one and only thing that keeps the fire going inside me is my Independence. My ability to function without the need for assistance from anyone. I decide when I eat. I decide when I go to sleep. I decide all my actions. Nobody tells me what to do. If I lose that freedom and control. I will lose all hope in everything. I will be an empty shell.\n\n3: I can't ask my mom to help me with anything. Any time I do, it's an immediate inconvenience for her. She will belittle me. She will insult me and put me down. At this point. I've decided the less I ask of her, the better. On the flip side. My brother helps me get showered. Unfortunately, He's only able to stop by here once a week because of his job. Yes, you read that correctly. That means I get to shower once a week. Pretty cool huh? Can you see why I'm locked in my room all the time?  \n\n\nThis has been my way of life for a while now. I can't say it's been good my any means. Seems like my high school years were the peak of my life so far. And 8 years later I'm just on a slippery slope down a dark void of a future. I don't really look forward to anything. I don't do anything cool with my life. Other people in their 20's are out posting pics online of all their crazy adventures. I'm just here........ Slowly losing hope in everything. I don't have money or friends to take me on adventures. I don't have any means of transportation do to anything. I try and see my current status as an outsider. I imagine they would feel nothing but utter disgust at the measures I take to preserve the one thing I have left. My independence. I wouldn't disagree if they did. I feel like useless trash. Maybe I should just accept it.\n\nI honestly don't know why on earth I took the time to write all this. People don't wanna hear about this. I'm just hoping by putting this out there. Maybe... just maybe some weight can be lifted off my shoulders. I can let my secret fly free to the birds. Of course this is the internet. I wouldn't be surprised to see this on a \"world grossest people\" list. Oh well. \n ",

If I think about the possibility of being the only sober one/sober driver (even though I don\u2019t drive yet) it makes the whole situation feel less fun and it also makes me feel really anxious because it\u2019ll mean I won\u2019t be as relaxed and happy as I normally am.

It turned me off forever of ever wanting to drink, and frankly, being around other people drinking.\n\nBut, most people drink. :( I'm stand-off-ish with people because there's only so much socializing people will do before meeting for drinks, and I just want to avoid that. My somewhat SO drinks, is understanding of my situation, but I'm afraid to see them drinking because it'd be such a turn-off. \n\nI don't even know what I'm afraid of - maybe being around people under the influence is just deeply unsettling/annoying. But it's scary being around people on the road to losing control, even if they never get there - because the whole time you're wondering if they will or not, and then I just can't relax.\n\nSome teetotalers are just fine people around drinkers and have a whole \"hey, you do you....I'm fine without\" attitude that I'm sort of jealous of. I'm just not comfortable around people drinking and it's so hard in a culture where drinking is everywhere, and people would rather drop you than drop drinking. :(",

   "selftext": "The last two years, my problem has exploded. After graduating college, I developed some pretty severe depression. There was no real trigger, I was just suddenly overwhelmed with an all-encompassing darkness and terrible self-loathing. And so my drinking pattern, which used to only be \"excessive\" during my college period, turned obscene. My personality changed... I began lying while drunk, I became aggressive, antagonistic, apathetic and rude. I got so good at sneaking drinks that people thought my tolerance was low... when in truth, it wasn't the five beers here in the living room that got me blasted, but the five vodka shots I had behind your back in the kitchen.\n\nI tried everything, like:\n\n* Alternating between alcoholic/non-alcoholic beer and drinks (ended up chugging beer later in the evening because \"I can; I haven't drank as much!\")\n* Staying away from liqueur (so then I drank 15 beers in 5 hours... and then ended up doing shots anyway in the end, because I was drunk out of my mind)\n* Having a \"number\" (I resolved, then, that if I had a \"number\", then I had a problem... and *I didn't have a problem... did I?*)\n* Telling myself that I'm not going to drink **much** this time (yeah, just... no)\n* Asking friends to \"watch me\" (you mean my non-alcoholic but fun-loving friends who think I'm just being hard on myself? That's also a solid no. Also, I have to do this on my own...)\n\n\n... and of course, a boatload of other things.\n\nIt has taken me so long to see that, truly, I am powerless if alcohol is in the picture... simply completely, utterly and totally powerless... and I screwed up again, guys.\n\nAugust 20th, 2017.\nDespite my girlfriend visiting me, I decided to go out. I asked her to join me with the guys, but she refused; she wasn't going to support me in my habit in any way, shape or form. That was the worst thing she could have said, because she was compromising my illusions by confronting me. I got angry at her, even though deep down I knew she was right... but it didn't matter - I needed a drink.\nI came home blackout drunk - so much so I couldn't attend work the next day. My GF told my mother that she would leave me if I couldn't get a grip on my drinking, and so I resolved then and there I would stop drinking. That lasted about eight months, and then I cracked.\n\n... and I could feel it coming. This deep-seated shadow rising up from the depths in me. Slowly, but completely surely.\n\n\"You used to be able to drink... why not now? What's changed?\" he whispered.\n\"All your friends drink... and all your friends do stupid stuff, too. Come on, have fun.\"\n\"You're only 24 years old. You can't possibly be an alcoholic. Besides, you have your life together! Alcoholics don't have their lives together...\"\n\"Are you really so weak that you can't control it?\"\n\"You can control it if you REALLY want to...\"\n\n... until I finally broke. I drank this Easter, and even though it \"went fine\", I could feel the demon stirring. This wasn't going to end well, but I completely disregarded the single voice from my soul that said, \"You know the truth, man... you know what's going to happen.\"\n\nAnd lo and behold, queue bachelor party in Wroclaw, Poland. I drank so much I fell asleep on the toilet, fell down on the bathroom floor, crawled into the shower and lay there until 10:30 AM (second time I've done that - flooded my apartment last July). I spent like $1000 at a stripclub, and got separated from the group in the evening and nearly lost my flight. I had to bribe the taxi driver to break the speed limit so I wasn't stranded in Poland.\n\nI landed yesterday... the last three days a haze of regret, pain and self-hate. I wept nearly all day yesterday, had borderline seizures during the night and I've been sweating and puking since. I was able to be at work for the first half of the day, but had to leave in the end because I was broken.\n\nAnd I'm in so much pain... emotionally, spiritually, physically. Is this really who I am? It can't be... because I despise that asshole that takes me over when I drink. I am 100 % certain that I'm going to be dead in not too long if I don't stop, and so I have... but I am terrified of losing that battle. I am paralyzed with fear, and with regret. I feel like the worst person in the world... like I deserve to die, and that I would be doing us all a favor if I just offed myself. This is where I am now.\n\nI hate it. I hate it so much. Alcohol is nothing short of demonic... and I can\u2019t master it. Ever. The fate of the entire world could hang in the balance and I would still take that God forsaken beer. And coming to terms with that fact, it hasn't only taken money, nearly my job, maybe my GF now too... it's taken my self-worth... taken away my self-respect; made me hate myself as much as I hate alcohol itself\u2026\n\nAnd I don't know what to do. I've cried reading the life-affirming posts, here... I am so happy that some of you have gotten out of it (if it's possible). I feel like my life is being sucked out of me and I'm freaking terrified.\n\nTL;DR: I am an alcoholic... I'm trying to stop again but I am so afraid I won't be able to do it.\n\nEDIT: Sorry, I'm struggling with reddit's text format. I hope this is readable.",

Since we quit drinking, my wife and I have always had a strict \"No alcohol in the house\" rule. We don't even keep cooking wine in the house...not because we would be tempted to drink it, but because having *any alcohol in the house* takes up space in our heads. Just having a bottle of cooking sherry would consume mental energy. Although we *know* we wouldn't actually drink cooking wine, the \"what if I took a swing\" thought would still pop into our heads. Making our home permanently alcohol-free gives a place to live in freedom and with clarity.    \nAnyway, as soon as they got into town, I laid down the law, plain and simple. I was open and honest with them about our policy. He and his wife (who isn't an alcoholic, but does drink) were very respectful and understanding. He definitely managed to get drunk when we went out for lunch and dinner, but it felt good to be up-front about how we felt.    \nI would highly recommend to anyone out there who is struggling in early sobriety to try to be as open as possible with your close friends (whether they are active alcoholics or not) about what you must do in order to maintain your sobriety. You'd be surprised how helpful this is to reinforce your support system. IWNDWYT.",

   "selftext": "The drinking age in my country is 19. I've been drinking heavily (approximately a mickey/a fifth a night or a six pack) for two years now, since I was 16. Alcoholism runs in my family hard and heavy and I knew it was going to ruin my life from the first sip of Jag that I stole from my mom's stash. Access to alcohol is incredibly easy for me as all of my friends are over 19, including my boyfriend. Some of them know I have a problem, some don't, but I typically have no problem picking up a few bottles a week or stealing booze from my parents. My childhood was all around traumatic, I suffered mental and physical abuse from my father, my mother was rarely around as she worked two jobs, and I was mostly responsible for raising my siblings. I was bullied in elementary and high school, have terrible self esteem, and was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder in grade 10. I have sever anger issues that mostly surface when I'm intoxicated. I was raped because of drinking, I lost a baby because of drinking. Alcohol cost me my first relationship after she got tired of me stumbling into our bed every night after being out with my drinking friends, usually wasted and agitated and looking for a fight. I eventually broke up with her because she didn't support my \"party lifestyle\" as I called it and because she was always untrusting and suspicious of me, and losing her almost killed me in the long run. When I'm sober I'm intelligent, creative, driven, and, above all, kind. I used to be that hippie-dippie tree lover girl that would never harm a fly and cared about the environment more than myself, but my drunken alter ego starts fights, punches walls and vehicles, litters, and starts fires. I hate who I become when I drink, yet every evening around 6/7 if not earlier I reach for my rum. I drink until I pass out and absolutely cannot stop myself after one drink, or two, or even half a bottle when I know I'm too drunk but I just don't care. I spend all day hungover in bed, sometimes dragging myself to work or sometimes calling in. My hours have been cut lately because I show up every day with a \"migraine\" and can't do much work or I call in sick leaving them scrambling to find a replacement. I used to be fantastic at my job, almost at a management position, respected by my coworkers, now I'm an annoyance. My grades in school were mediocre but I know I could've done so much better if I hadn't showed up to school drunk or hungover or usually not at all. Now I'm out of high school but not yet in college and feeling completely hopeless, lost, and useless... but not for long. This is day one. Last night I ignored the bottle that was calling my name, smoked a little weed, and went to bed at midnight. I've made it a day or two before, 8 days being my longest, but this time I know I have to do this for myself, my relationship, my friends, and my future. I need to better myself. I'm tired of being the drinker of the group, casually being referred to as an alcoholic, of feeling guilty every morning. So, cheers to day one I suppose. I will not drink with you today.",

   "selftext": "That pretty much says it. I drank about 13 years a lot of the week but not every day. For the past 6 up until I I quit I drank anywhere from 12\\-18 beers daily usually spread over the whole day. My only break was for 5 days years ago when I ran out of money temporarily. \n\nI simply got tired of it and went in to detox for a couple days. It kept interrupting my sleep, I was bruising way too easy, getting sick and \\(maybe from lack of sleep\\) starting to hallucinate. I have seizures now and then naturally \\(why I started drinking so much I suppose\\) so detox was my only option because trying to quit would just send me to the hospital anyway.\n\nI'm very happy I made that choice.\n\nAt the hospital they performed some tests and my liver enzymes and stuff were out of whack. My sugar was rather high which was unusual and has gone away.\n\nHonestly I'm not sure what's normal. I'm not even sure exactly where my liver stands because I'm seeing a new doctor and their patient portal doesn't show exact results for all tests.\n\nI know some things are just a little off but my blood cells are large and my protein levels simply show \"\\&gt;300\" which I know is rather high. I can't see results for any of the enzymes.\n\nI've no yellowing but I form random bruises without being bumped. I also bruise very easily now whereas before you could whack my full force and I just wasn't the type to bruise. Some days I wake up and all I can do is puke everywhere if I try to consume even water.\n\nI obviously haven't completely killed my liver yet but I'm not sure I'd be able to say that if I kept on much longer.\n\nI don't intend to drink again. It's not like other drugs I've quit in the past where I'm sitting there wishing for it after. I simply got tired of it. Seeing it turns my stomach, I want nothing to do with it. Thinking about how much time I've wasted almost makes me sick to my stomach but you can't change what's done.\n\nI know the liver can heal itself if it hasn't gone too far. I'm really not sure what I'm looking for here. I guess someone that was in a similar situation. Maybe someone with similar side effects from drinking too much. I'm hoping it goes away and everything returns to normal.\n\nThis can be a very hard thing to get away from once you get attached. I am healing here but can't remember the last time I felt this good. It's worth quitting if you are stuck on it. It might not seem like it but I know I'm never going back.\n\nBest of luck to all of you. ",

   "selftext": "##Intro/tl;dr\n\nEDIT: [Xpost in r/medicine](https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/8lbe39/im_worried_my_girlfriends_doctor_may_be_taking/)\n\nMy girlfriend, R\u2019s (30F, 145 lbs, 5'6\"), doctor, D, claims to practice alternative medicine, functional medicine, integrative medicine, holistic medicine, naturopathic medicine, etc. D has her buying large amounts of supplements from D\u2019s personal store. D recommends (both directly to R and on D\u2019s blog) expensive  treatments including homeopathy, acupuncture, rolfing, neurofeedback, multiple exclusion diets, and various \u2018detoxification\u2019 supplements/treatments; and claims that these treatments are research-based and supported by science.\n\n##Background and Diagnosis\n\nR suffers from chronic full-body pain, fatigue, anxiety, insomnia, and itchy skin rashes. She has had several of these symptoms for over a decade, although they have been worse during the past year. R has had many past issues with doctors not taking her seriously and labeling her as a hypochondriac, exaggerator, or attention-seeker. This has lead to trust issues and insecurities about doctors (and even doubts about her own sanity). I, personally, have zero doubts that she suffers, and R is a very intelligent, motivated woman. Her chronic pain ended her career as a classical musician, and in the past year, her pain and constant medical appointments have prevented her from working a full-time job. It also prevents/limits almost all of her hobbys/passions\n\nR has been diagnosed with lupus (~6 months ago), fibromyalgia, and gluten sensitivity. She has had a tremendous amount of expensive medical tests done, almost all of which look normal. D says that R has low B-vitamins, very low iron and very low testosterone, although R says that D uses narrower acceptable ranges for at least the B-vitamins. R has also had some very recent tests that show connective tissue damage from autoimmune responses. She has been told that fibromyalgia is an autoimmune disease.\n\nI will try to update this section with more information from R later if I can. She is on a long list of medications in addition to supplements.\n\n##Doctor and additional concerns regarding treatment\n\nD is a licensed physician with an MD from a reputable medical school and practices at a major regional hospital. D has been R\u2019s primary physician for around ten years. R and I believe that she has considerable medical knowledge despite her alternative medicine fascination. R describes D as laid-back and compassionate. R feels that D takes her condition seriously unlike other doctors. R has been lead to believe that there are two kinds of doctors, doctors of \u2018functional medicine\u2019, who treat root causes of disease, and \u2018osteopathic medicine\u2019 doctors who treat specific symptoms via drugs. I originally thought that R was doing very experimental treatments, but a seed of confusion was planted in my head after R said D told her that she needs to buy pink Himalayan salt instead of ordinary salt because of its natural minerals. D\u2019s blog is filled with similar ideas, and she sells many skincare and dietary products to patients.\n\nD has recently put R on two exclusion diets simultaneously, a \u2018paleo autoimmune protocol\u2019 diet for lupus and an aniti-histamine diet for skin rashes. (R was previously on a gluten-free vegan diet, although mostly from personal choice). These diets leave very few foods available for R to eat, and she finds it extremely difficult to adhere to. Out of concern for R, I began researching her autoimmune diet, and found recent (interesting)[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0961203313501401] (research)[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11882-013-0404-6]. At first, I was pleasantly surprised that D was familiar with such preliminary, speculative work.\n\nHowever, I then looked more into a book that D recommended R. The book, Autoimmune FIx, is a book about autoimmune treatments by (this chiropractor.)[http://thedr.com/]. I\u2019ll let the website speak for itself. This guy claims that a gluten-free diet can cure ADHD while citing a paper showing that a gluten-free diet reduces ADHD symptoms in coeliac patients. He claims that gluten is related to autism, and that all autoimmune diseases work through similar \u2018leaky gut\u2019 mechanisms as coeliac disease. His autoimmune protocol includes things like avoiding all non-food gluten products like makeup and living in houses made from organic materials. He claims that failure to adhere to any aspect of the protocol will render it ineffective. He is affiliated with the Institute for Functional Medicine.\n\nThis started to make me skeptical about some other treatments D was giving R. D has R taking an enormous number of supplements from D\u2019s store. R will down 10+ pills multiple times a day, and R probably has over 50 pill bottles in her kitchen. R has also spent enormous amounts of money on very expensive treatments like rolfing, neurofeedback, etc. that I mentioned earlier. R has been told that much of her pain comes from postural and \u2018alignment\u2019 issues that these bodywork specialists are fixing.\n\n##R\u2019s opinions\n\nI\u2019ve recently discussed/shared all of this with R. R has had frequent doubts in D, expresses frustration that all of the treatments that D says cures everyone else, never work for her. However, R does believe that ultrasound therapy and rolfing are helping her. R has searched for other doctors before, but has issues with being taken seriously, or being immediately prescribed with drugs that haven\u2019t worked for her in the past. I think this may be partly due to R\u2019s use of alternative medicine and pseudoscience terms to explain her problems. R has done tons of reading on all of these topics herself, but has quit recently, due to the amount of conflicting information that she finds. She feels that she doesn\u2019t know who to believe or trust. \n\n##Questions\n\nI think trusting your boyfriend over your doctor is a completely whacko idea, but I\u2019m scared that she is being referred around this network of alternative health providers, and it\u2019s preventing her from getting real medical care. I think that D sincerely believes in these treatments, and D says that many of them have changed her life, but the amount of money that has gone from R to D and her referral\u2019s also makes me wonder if R is being taken advantage of financially. These people are very nice to R and spend a lot of time with her. I feel like a conspiracy theorist.\n\n1. Is this something I should be worried about, or am I blowing this out of proportion?\n2. If this is as bad as I think it is, is there any way that I should report D?\n3. What are your thoughts on R\u2019s diagnosis and symptoms?\n4. What are your thoughts on R\u2019s treaments?\n\nThank you\n\ntl;dr: My girlfriend, R\u2019s (30F), doctor, D, claims to practice alternative medicine, functional medicine, integrative medicine, holistic medicine, naturopathic medicine, etc. D has her buying large amounts of supplements from D\u2019s personal store. D recommends (both directly to R and on D\u2019s blog) expensive  treatments including homeopathy, acupuncture, rolfing, neurofeedback, multiple exclusion diets, and various \u2018detoxification\u2019 supplements/treatments; and claims that these treatments are research-based and supported by science.\n\nEDIT: spelling and a couple additional details about D\n\nEDIT2: D has not prescribed any drugs for lupus. R also does not suffer from IBS. I was mistaken",

   "selftext": "So I\u2019m a 17 year old girl and I am kind of living as a camper rn so I study at an Internet cafe. \n\nThere\u2019s this older man who is almost always there, the first whom introduced himself to me. He\u2019s always talking about himself and basically gave me his life story about immigrating from New Zealand,lost his green card, ID got stolen, quitting drinking and struggles with alcoholism, being my age in the 70s, etc. I\u2019m not familiar with what the New Zealand accent sounds like except from movies but he sounds Canadian or American to me, and I\u2019d figure they\u2019d sound more like Aussies. He\u2019s also very white looking, which I thought New Zealand was more Maori/Maori mixed descent. But I know there\u2019s white people there too, so that\u2019s not a very important observation. \n\nI try to be polite but I need to study. He keeps commenting on how I look like Judy garland (I\u2019m biracial and I don\u2019t), how I\u2019m beautiful, look like an actress, and should get into modeling. Keeps saying \u201cvery attractive\u201d. \n\nThe next few days he\u2019s still there, and told me I\u2019d look very attractive as a blond and should dye my hair blond and that my mother would freak out because she dyes hers blond. He also says he finds my mother attractive as well and that \u201cmy mom didn\u2019t look like that\u201d. \n\nHe kept talking about his 62nd Birthday so I wished him a happy birthday and didn\u2019t want to get into an extended convo. \n\nHe wouldn\u2019t stop commenting on my looks, how I\u2019m \u201cvery attractive\u201d, my hair (he noticed a minor trim), every single outfit I wear, and he asked if I was 16 because he said I looked 16. I told him I was 17.  This creeped me out because of him saying both that I was very attractive and trying to flirt in a not so subtle way and the fact that he\u2019s 4 times my age. \n\nThen apparently my mom told me he said that he wanted to give me personal guitar lessons to make me a star and could make me famous. And that he should have personal time with me. \n\nI try not to speak much except a simple hello and a slight smile not to come off as a total bitch. \n\nSo.....after I go to the web cafe, I keep seeing him around town, and around the places I shower or go to eat or etc. The same places I go and there\u2019s a lot of them. The places I go are fairly quiet. I start going to Starbucks instead but depending on what we\u2019re doing the Internet cafe is often more convenient. \n\nI\u2019m a bit creeped out. Advice? Do I have a right to be irked or am I just being a special snowflake? \n",

   "selftext": "On my 4-year post, someone asked what positive changes I noticed after being sober for 4 years. That question is not something that can just be answered in a comment. 4 years is a long time and lots of ups and downs. If this following flood of text is too much for you, you're welcome to read my post history, I have been quite raw and open about the struggles I've been through.\n\nWhen I first came to this  SD group at 5 days dry, I was married, had a house, a fenced-in backyard, two dogs and a stable job. I also was an I also was an absolute wreck. I was a suicidal, out of control, miserable addict and alcoholic. I was not accountable to anyone, I could not be trusted, I was a very poor spouse, and I would lie, cheat, and steal in order to feed my habits.\n\nI quit drinking using this subreddit, therapy with a counselor who specializes in and 12-step program meetings and getting active with the recovery community. I have a sponsor and I sponsor other people but that wasn't the case early on. At five months sober my ex-husband was diagnosed with aggressive cancer. This subreddit showed me all the support in the world. Not only did we battle that first cancer, but he was also diagnosed with prostate cancer a year later.\n\nBeing sober and working an active program of recovery gave me the ability to be clear-headed, present, responsible, and able to be a caregiver. The recovery Community gave me so much support both online and in-person, otherwise I'm not sure I would have survived. People that I thought would always have supported me disappeared, especially when I was no longer going to bars and doing activities that involved booze or drugs.\n\nPeople who had only known me 5 months through 12 step meetings or through online chats showed up and went above and beyond to support both my ex-husband and I. It was amazing. At the same time I was struggling to be a caregiver and work a full-time job and balance other responsibilities I was still able to be accountable and be active in service to others. That was the first time I've ever been responsible in my adult life.\n\nAfter battling two kinds of cancer, my ex-husband who is still a good friend, decided he wanted to go back to his own drinking and partying ways. He chose alcohol, I chose sobriety. It's not as simple as that, but that's what it came down to in the very end. We went through a divorce that broke my heart, because I was choosing to leave someone I loved because I needed to stay sober first. Anything I put before my recovery I will lose.\n\nI moved out and lived on my own as an adult for the first time. I explored being able to be social as a single person in recovery. I eventually tried and online dating website and met a wonderful man who had quit drinking one week before we met. That wonderful man has become my second husband, he has been nothing but supportive of my recovery and often encourages me to be of service and to go to meetings.\n\nMy health has improved in these for years. My skin has life to it, my eyes are no longer bloodshot, my blood count levels are so much more normal than they ever were before, my liver is recovering after years of abuse. My mental health has improved. When I stopped putting a depressant liquid substance into my body, my antidepressants were finally able to start working. Even when things got darkest, I was able to breathe. My new husband does suicide intervention and prevention for the military, what a strange way my higher power has worked things out for me.\n\nThrough 4 years of working a 12-step program, admitting my faults and becoming responsible for the things I have done, making amends and trying to clean away the wreckage of my past, I have repaired friendships and relationships I never thought I would see again. I have cleaned out old debts and I have rebuilt my self-esteem and my image of self-worth.\n\nI am closer to my family than I have ever been before. I stopped hiding my addiction and my faults and my behaviors from them, got honest and got real, and I am so grateful for the blessings that have come to me in return.\n\nAt this point in my sobriety, I am active with multiple service positions in local recovery communities. I am on the committee of a women's retreat, I participate in taking 12 step meetings in to a local prison, I host a big book study for women, I have been a speaker at meetings and I chair meetings at my home group and at other locations on a regular basis. Yes, that is a lot of things. But, one hour here or there compared to multiple hours every night being checked out or blacked out? It absolutely weighs in my favor.\n\nIf you have actually read this far, here are my final thoughts. It is worth it. It will get worse before it gets better, it will get better, then it will get worse, and if you stick with it you may end up with a life beyond your wildest dreams. The road along sobriety and Recovery is not a smooth and easy road. If it were easy, none of us would call ourselves alcoholics we wouldn't have a problem in the first place. But the road has many benefits if you stick with it.\n\nStay sober my friends. I will not drink with you today.\n\nMouse",

   "selftext": "I just have to get some things off my chest, I am feeling very confused and stressed. Last night had a 3 hour phone conversation with my ex boyfriend, we broached the subject of getting back together. We\u2019ve only been together for about 10 months, it was a very good experience up until about a month ago, and I love him so much, I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this before, and we have such an amazing connection. His drinking does bother me, I hate to see him killing himself, and I don\u2019t like the person he becomes the more he\u2019s had to drink. Some background, both of my parents were alcoholics, my dad, the lonely depressed angry belligerent, and my mom, the life of the party, happy go lucky gal who wanted to be friends with everyone (yet ignored me growing up). I definitely have many issues of my own related to alcoholism and how I handle myself in order to cope with it and what it does to my emotions and the person it turns me into. I know that I am codependent in relationships. The last month or so though has been filled with conflict and emotional pain. He broke up with me, because he said I was not being truthful with him about how much his drinking bothered me. I was slightly dumbfounded because I didn\u2019t know I was supposed to say something, I just kept quiet, I didn\u2019t realize how much I had been suppressing my feelings, it was as if I just went on autopilot in terms of expressing (not expressing) my feelings any time it had to do with alcohol or drinking or the problems it creates or the way it makes me feel (so much conflict growing up and so much anger tied into drinking for me, so in a way I shut down). In many ways he was right about what I was doing, and I am glad that he pointed that out to me and is actually open to having a dialogue about it. We ended up getting back together a week later only to break up again 2 weeks after that (he ended it again over what I believe was a complete misunderstanding). I was so angry at him during these break ups (technically we are still broken up). I told him I never wanted to be in an on again off again relationship, yet here I am it seems. I avoided talking with him, and wanted to move on without him, he broke it off so I figured he doesn\u2019t want me in his life, so I don\u2019t want to be with someone who doesn\u2019t want to be with me and I started thinking at that point maybe I don\u2019t want to be with a person who drinks so much, maybe this isn\u2019t healthy for me. It\u2019s been about 2 weeks, and he had been calling me and texting me, I tried to ignore most of it. We emailed each other to try to get some closure with things and he still wanted to call me and talk to me, I told him I didn\u2019t see the point, yet I finally answered his phone call. We talked for over 3 hours and I feel like I was able to get a lot of things off my chest and that he actually listened. I realized just how hard it is for me to open up about these topics and he seemed to genuinely care about what I had to say and wanting to try to understand. He made a casual mention of quitting drinking and I told him I needed space and that I and was very hurt. I can understand where he is coming from as far as the issues he had with my lack of communication and our miscommunication but I told him that when you\u2019re in a relationship with someone you can\u2019t just end things like that so abruptly and then want to talk about it after the fact, after the damage and hurt have been done. He said he wants to work on having a healthy and productive relationship with me and that if it takes phone calls for months until we see each other again he is willing to do that. I told him I\u2019m just not sure, that I\u2019m afraid to get hurt again, if I say something that he misunderstands instead of talking to me, is he just going to break up with me. What kind of self respecting person goes back after being dumped twice? He said that he was wrong in the manner in which he handled things and that talking about things is what people in relationships do, I understand they take work, but this has had me all torn up since it started back in April. I want to have a conversation about the possibility of him actually quitting drinking, but I feel like that is a pipe dream and setting myself up for more hurt. That codependent side of me is looking for ways I can help him, there has to be a way, and then the other side of me is saying, whoa, slow down, you\u2019re not even together right now, and this might be a really bad idea. I love him so much and I know he loves me, but it also seems that sometimes love is not enough. I think about things I\u2019ve read that say an alcoholic can\u2019t recover if they are in a relationship then I\u2019ve heard stories of people saying that they recovered with the help of their friends and family, and when you care about someone you help them. He may not even really want to stop drinking, he has brought it up a few times, but then has said other things like he will never quit, I can only imagine how difficult it must be, but people do it. I know that he has to do it for himself, and not for me or our relationship, but these things all seemed very intertwined. Lately since the break up I\u2019ve been trying to focus on myself, my physical and mental health and well being, doing things with friends to keep my mind off of things, and of course all of my friends don\u2019t see why this is eating me up inside, they just tell me to block his number and never talk to him again, why would I want to be with someone who drinks that much, and why would I ever take someone back who has broken my heart twice in 3 weeks. I feel like I\u2019m going to alienate my friends and I am so torn on what I should do. I can\u2019t imagine not talking to him again ever, and I\u2019m not ready to make a decision on our relationship status just yet, I know I don\u2019t have to decide right now, but just talking to him last night brought back all those old feelings (that had never really gone away). By the end of the conversation we were even laughing and joking around and sharing about what was going on with our lives. My walls came back down and I just wanted to be with him again, but I have tread very cautiously here. Like I said, just needed to get this out. ",

This went on for a year. Saw many specialist and nothing was found. Doc ordered brain scan just to \"fish for a reason, not because there was any suspicion of anything wrong with my brain\". Was scared and never went to do it. Changed doc and had many tests done at which I also started mentioning my depression and anxiety and we both came to an agreement that maybe the cause of my nausea/vomiting was due to anxiety. Doc put me on Zoloft and Xanax \\(about 8 months ago\\) and now it only happens on rare occasions, much less frequent than before. I've stopped taken Zoloft for a few weeks two times and started getting sick again so fairly certain it is anxiety related. Benzo tolerance came on quick. Within 2 months I went up from .25mg to 2mg a day. Although I was abusing them taking anywhere from 2mg \\- 8mg a day. After 2 months I quit Xanax cold turkey. I also quit drinking shortly after, as I would drink 3 \\- 10 beers a night for the last 8 months roughly. Often mixing benzos and alcohol causing black out. I was also dealing with my wife having an affair at the time which made my depression and anxiety much worse causing me to self harm a few times.\n\nSorry for the lengthy history. Currently writing this at work while trying to distract myself from having a panic attack. Now that you know my background. The big question, and maybe this is the wrong sub for this but I figured it's worth a shot.\n\nI consider myself a perfectionist with all things, not saying I'm great at all things but I always try my best, if I'm not trying my absolute best then I'm not in a good mood. Our marriage counselor recently mentioned perfectionism goes hand in hand with anxiety. I haven't mentioned to our counselor that I have been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety, and panic disorder. It was just a follow up statement he mentioned after he asked me if I consider myself a perfectionist and I said yes. Not sure if there is any medical data to ACTUALLY back this, but assuming he is correct. It made me think.\n\nDepression, anxiety, addiction, alcoholism, marijuana dependance, shopping addiction, OCD. All of which I believe are some sort of mental illness, weather it be an actual disorder or a self control issue. Maybe this is just me over thinking things but could all these issues some how be related? Maybe I should have gotten the brain scan. Any change there is maybe something actually wrong with me physically?\n\nIf this is the wrong sub is there a correct sub to ask this?",

I apologize ahead of time if this seems like some text vomit here...\n\nSo, I\u2019m looking for some advice/input from all of you lovely people in regards to my situation.\n\nA little background here. I have been sober since 7/25/17 and have gotten sober through AA. Had a sponsor, followed directions as they were given, worked the 12 steps. After doing 90+ meetings in 90 days, I was going to 4-5 meetings a week.\n\nNow, life has picked up. I have a (non-alcoholic) partner, I graduate cosmetology school next month, I test for my cosmetology license and begin working full time in July... basically life is getting busy. I\u2019m finding that as I approach a year of sobriety, I have become much less dependent on AA. I KNOW that I simply cannot drink because I can not control my drinking, drinking does not make bad situations good, or good situations better, yada yada. I have no desire to drink or fix my problems with drinking. I also see a therapist weekly where I discuss my addiction recovery. \n\nMy question to you all... I feel like I can only extend myself in so many directions. My sponsor has told me that if I cannot attend at least 3-4 meetings every week, that she will not sponsor me. Would taking a step back from the program (NOT my sobriety, just the program of AA) be a huge misstep? Have you been successful staying sober without a structured program such as AA? I would really appreciate any feedback or suggestions from all of you lovely people. \n\nThanks in advance! ",

I constantly get told that there\u2019s no way I could\u2019ve developed a \u2018real\u2019 drinking problem in the short time I\u2019ve been on this planet, but I know better. In a relatively brief period, my heavy alcohol dependency has:\n-destroyed friendships and relationships \n-made me into a stealing, dishonest, manipulative person \n-led me to making risky decisions that could\u2019ve resulted in STDs or pregnancy \n-put me in a vulnerable position that led to a bad sexual assault \n-exacerbated my suicidal tendencies and depression\n-induced hospital visits \n-shown me lab results with signs of early liver problems \n-put me on a dangerous and predictable path that would\u2019ve fulfilled my family\u2019s alcoholism prophecy \n-almost caused me to fail out of school\n\nBut\u2014 three months ago, after waking up yet again in a puke-filled haze at a random frat house, worried about being pregnant or having been assaulted again, and considering slicing my wrists with the broken bottle by my feet\u2014 I decided that enough was enough. I was sick of being the notorious depressed drunk girl. I was tired of feeling like I couldn\u2019t make it through the day without a several shots. I hated that I was banned from several friends\u2019 places for stealing alcohol and ruining property. I didn\u2019t want to keep bringing two extra flasks to parties because my tolerance had gotten too high to get drunk from the free drinks I could weasel out of people. I was a depressed, disgusting mess that was hiding the intelligent and capable person I now know I am. \n\nThese three months have brought good grades, a stable, happy relationship, clear skin and a clearer head, better mental health, and relief. So much relief. So much hope. So much pride. I struggle so much still, and I can\u2019t be left alone in a room with alcohol, but I have better, supportive friends that keep me accountable when I get bad cravings. The first two weeks were hell, but now I get to see Sunday mornings without feeling like human garbage. I get to flip off the drunks in my family. I get to be a whole person with goals instead of a ghost fixated on successfully stealing another handle. In college, all around me, I see people who are still digging themselves into deeper holes. In them, I see what I could\u2019ve been, and I am so grateful for who I am instead. \n\nThis is for other teens like me who also peruse this sub, feeling twinges of familiarity and creeping concern that you might be in over your head:\nGet out while you can. Set up a better life that\u2019s not defined by addiction and sickness. Get help. Your body and your future self will thank you. ",

I watched a video, I forgot who, but they explained how some types of alcoholics react to alcohol the way I do and it made so much sense.  I drink to get \"energy\" but when the energy wears off I feel hungover ~ 20 minutes later.  I drink again and get another boost and another and another.  After each drink or shot, I feel good for a few minutes.  It wears off so I do it again.  This is the same as being addicted to Heroin.  It works basically the same as explained but I have never tried it so I don't know. My type of alcoholic is very dangerous as I would drink until I blacked out and sometimes that was enough to stay in my system for a long long time.

Like it's all just a blur to me.  \n  I would say I'm somewhat of an alcoholic.  I drink 2 to 4 times a week.  But what really concerns me is when I have an extra long weekend or days off work.  I will binge on drugs and alcohol to the point where when I have to go back to work I have to really think hard about what the fuck I've been doing the past couple of days.  This feeling, or situation, happens even when I'm sober for a week.  Sometimes I just have to think back on the week and really question wtf just happened.\n  It feels kinda like waking up from a raging night at a party where you got blacked out and only remember bits and pieces.  But instead of just one night it's like a whole week for me. It's like I was on autopilot and I wasn't storing memories properly or something.\n  I also have a problem with urges to just fucking binge my guts out.  I can go about a week and a half of being sober and totally responsible and super productive.  Like I will be on my fucking a game, making shit happen.  But then one day I'll just be like fuck it let's get shwifty.  And I'll find myself cooked out, drinking and driving to a bar I don't even like to pick up crazy girls I don't even like.

A girl, relevant later. My entire life, my parents have been partiers. They had wild parties, were stuck in their college ways. My dad was, what I thought and maybe think \"functional\". He grew up poor, started his own companies and sold them young. We, me and my brother who is 10 years my senior, lived good childhoods. Got everything we wanted, not in a spoiled way, but we were privileged. To make a long story short, I grew up used to my parents drinking and some nights, it going to far. I remember my mom falling down the stairs once. My dad always, always, ends up partying by himself and playing music super loud all night.\n\nIt sounds so tame, he was never violent at least that I saw, and his verbal insults were pretty mild compared to most \\(though frequent\\) besides to my mom. I'm strong willed and get upset and I would spend many nights trying to hide his speakers, only for him to tell me that I didn't deserve anything, I'm so horrible, yada yada.\n\nReally parsing details but: I found out his father is an alcoholic. He was bad through my dad's childhood and doesn't drink anymore and has never since I was alive. My brother is bipolar, he doesn't drink. I think in part due tohis diagnosis but also because I believe he saw or decided he was alcoholic as well. He lives in India and his wife doesn't drink so there's a lot of factors \\(my family is from US and we're 100&amp;#37; American\\)\n\nMy parents moved to Europe when I was 17 and graduated HS \\(it's not what you think, I'm independent, my dad sold his companies and I wanted to move out to go to my college town before starting freshman year and they supported me\\). I don't see them much anymore just because of the distance but I do see them about 3 months total out of the year with visiting each other. However, the culture here has daily alcohol consumption starting at lunch. For most, that's where it ends, besides some wine with dinner. My mom smokes too and since coming here from the states, is smoking I don't know how many more, but a lot.\n\nI am here now visiting and things are much worse. He's gotten extremely, extremely drunk twice in the last three days. When I was younger it was once every month, sometimes a lot longer sometimes not. He's hurling curses at me and my boyfriend \\(which is so, so embarrassing and tough for us all\\), verbally attacking my mom, and yelling at us. Telling us we're not fun, telling us he's not doing anything wrong. just because we asked him to turn the music down. The first time this week, he was at the bar with my bf and my bf's father who was visiting us. To skip a lot of details, my dad kept them out late and he lied to my mom and to me. He told my bf and father that I was lying for attention. This is really hurtful because my boyfriend and I are really, really serious and his family is so amazing and I was so nervous for them to meet. I knew it would happen. I got upset, I love my family and my dad's really hard on my mom. I told her she didn't deserve this. She told me it was normal for a man to do this, all she could do was wait and accept his morning apology. My dad is sexist and plays anything off on the fact that we're women. But pleaase, let it be known, I love him and my family more than anything. It's not every night, I live on my own almost entirely sustained on my bf's and my's own \\(will be 100&amp;#37; in a few months\\) and he's given me such a great life. When he's sober, he's amazing, so amazing.\n\nTonight though, it hit me, hard. We had a boozy lunch which was a mistake.. it's a weekly tradition with all of his new friends. They seem to party too, but they stopped at lunch. He wanted to \"go into town\" which I knew meant keep drinking. I know the warning signs and knew that was a recipe for disaster. So I said no, let's go home. So we did and he said he had to walk his dog. He didn't come home for three hours, hammered. From 2 pm until 1 am he was playing music and getting progressively... my brother calls it emotional. he's happy but he's quick to change. Don't tell him what to do or he'll get very sensitive and upset and hurt. It's so sad. It's so fucking sad. I can't stop crying. He's such a smart man and he's killing himself. I went to go yell at him to please turn it down and I looked through the glass pane of the kitchen and he's dancing to his music and there was... no emotion on his face. There was nothing behind his eyes. It was just the drink. I can't do it. Please help me. I don't know how to help him. My mom. She came out and grabbed me because I just lost it when I looked into his eyes. I saw the man I looked up to my entire life, my dad. I'm just his baby girl, and I want to help him. My mom grabbed me and brought me to her room and held me. I told her what I saw.\n\nMy mom is so stoic, she drinks a lot too but I know it's to cope with him. I don't think she has a problem. She doesn't drink when she's happy. I guess that means she has a problem. I'm sorry I'm so over the place, I've never let go like this. My mom never cries, is tough on me and as stubborn as anything. She looked at me tonight and said that she's going to leave him. Fuck. They're college sweethearts, my dad is going to be crushed. But she can't let this be her norm and she's right. She deserves to be happy. I'm so scared, I'm afraid my dad won't get the help. I want her to leave him a little too though. I told her to come live with me in the US and I think she may. I'm worried what my dad will do. I think he has some mental problems, something. He's so sensitive, I'm afraid he'll kill himself honestly.\n\nPlease help me. Please. I don't knpw how to help my family. I don't know how I can make my dad admit his problem is real and it breaks my heart to think that this man, this amazing man, is going to wake up tomorrow like he always does and feel so fucking guilty about the way he acted tonight. He cares so much about what people think about him \\(while simultaneously being very egotistical, borderline narcissistic\\). I know he feels inadequate right now because we were with my bf's family this week and my boyfriend's father is very, very wealthy and my dad always has to compare himself to others. I know he wishes he could have been more successful for me.\n\nMy brother and mother want him to go to India for a few months to detox the way my brother did. My worry is that, if he even does it, when he comes back here, the lfiestyle they lvie with their friends is not conducive to being clean. My mom says that one of their friends only has one glass of wine but i know that the answer is none for him. I'm scared because it was my brother's choice.\n\nI'm just so scared that he's going to die. I'm afriad he's killing my mom with him. I want to be able to be around him without wishing I could run away. I feel so guilty. I just want to help. I don't know how, he's so fragile and sensitive and I leave for the US soon. My mom would never tell me anything, like I said, she's stubborn and stoic. Any advice, please.",

   "selftext": "This might be too much and I know everyone has different situations that are delicate too, but I don't know where to go anymore. I just want change.\n\nI'm a college kid. A girl, relevant later. My entire life, my parents have been partiers. They had wild parties, were stuck in their college ways. My dad was, what I thought and maybe think \"functional\". He grew up poor, started his own companies and sold them young. We, me and my brother who is 10 years my senior, lived good childhoods. Got everything we wanted, not in a spoiled way, but we were privileged. To make a long story short, I grew up used to my parents drinking and some nights, it going to far. I remember my mom falling down the stairs once. My dad always, always, ends up partying by himself and playing music super loud all night.\n\nIt sounds so tame, he was never violent at least that I saw, and his verbal insults were pretty mild compared to most \\(though frequent\\) besides to my mom. I'm strong willed and get upset and I would spend many nights trying to hide his speakers, only for him to tell me that I didn't deserve anything, I'm so horrible, yada yada.\n\nReally parsing details but: I found out his father is an alcoholic. He was bad through my dad's childhood and doesn't drink anymore and has never since I was alive. My brother is bipolar, he doesn't drink. I think in part due tohis diagnosis but also because I believe he saw or decided he was alcoholic as well. He lives in India and his wife doesn't drink so there's a lot of factors \\(my family is from US and we're 100&amp;#37; American\\)\n\nMy parents moved to Europe when I was 17 and graduated HS \\(it's not what you think, I'm independent, my dad sold his companies and I wanted to move out to go to my college town before starting freshman year and they supported me\\). I don't see them much anymore just because of the distance but I do see them about 3 months total out of the year with visiting each other. However, the culture here has daily alcohol consumption starting at lunch. For most, that's where it ends, besides some wine with dinner. My mom smokes too and since coming here from the states, is smoking I don't know how many more, but a lot.\n\nI am here now visiting and things are much worse. He's gotten extremely, extremely drunk twice in the last three days. When I was younger it was once every month, sometimes a lot longer sometimes not. He's hurling curses at me and my boyfriend \\(which is so, so embarrassing and tough for us all\\), verbally attacking my mom, and yelling at us. Telling us we're not fun, telling us he's not doing anything wrong. just because we asked him to turn the music down. The first time this week, he was at the bar with my bf and my bf's father who was visiting us. To skip a lot of details, my dad kept them out late and he lied to my mom and to me. He told my bf and father that I was lying for attention. This is really hurtful because my boyfriend and I are really, really serious and his family is so amazing and I was so nervous for them to meet. I knew it would happen. I got upset, I love my family and my dad's really hard on my mom. I told her she didn't deserve this.

   "selftext": "Throwaway because some people IRL know my username but don't know how bad my problem with alcohol is.\n\nI've never had a healthy relationship with alcohol. At first I thought it was just normal college kid behavior. Then it was just a twenty\\-something behavior and now...it's way more than that. The past two years have been especially bad.\n\nI've been actively trying to give up alcohol completely since last fall. I do really well for awhile but then just get, idk, tired of fighting it. Then I can drink daily \\- 2 bottles of wine in a sitting. A box of wine does not last me even a weekend.\n\nBecause of alcohol I've put myself in dangerous situations. I've risked the safety of those I love.\n\nPart of me feels like maybe I'm just not trying hard enough to quit. I'm on a medication currently to help with the cravings. I've gone to AA on and off. It should be so easy to just drive past the liquor store. And maybe I'm not a \"bad enough\" alcoholic for residential treatment.\n\nSo today I was talking with my therapist about this. About how I do so well for a stretch of time and then just wake up one day exhausted from the work it takes to be healthy. That probably doesn't even make sense does it?\n\nSo she suggested residential treatment. A 30 day program. And encouraged me to look up the one in my area. As she was explaining it I wanted to cry.\n\nMy initial thoughts? I can forget about everything else and just focus on me and my demons. I can put away my responsibilities: my job, bills, career, child, pets, my house and just...push a reset button. I've actually been daydreaming about how great a break like that would be.\n\nMy secondary thoughts? Who will take care of my pets? I can't be away from my kid that long. What will work think? Will they even let me be gone that long? and PEOPLE ARE REALLY GOING TO KNOW WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME IF I DO THIS.\n\nHas anyone else here ever done residential treatment? I don't even know if I would meet the criteria for residential treatment but there is an intensive outpatient program too but that residential treatment sounds like fucking heaven to me right now.\n\nI'm probably the first person ever daydreaming about residential treatment.",

   "selftext": "I'm here at 200 days.  Listen, life is hella better without alcohol in it.  I didn't drink super \"often\".  But that was mainly due to the fact that I was still doing mental gymnastics to hide it from everyone around me.  I spent a lot of time angry about the fact that I wasn't able to drink as often or even as freely as I wanted to.\nI \"cherished\" times where I could be alone to drink.  When my still-boyfriend (now fianc\u00e9) was out of town, work trips, trips to visit my family when my fianc\u00e9 could not make it.  Those were the times I would try to drink the most.\nThere were also nights where I became emboldened to wait until my fianc\u00e9 fell asleep, and under the guise of \"being on the phone with my mom\", or \"doing work in our basement\", or whatever excuse--I would get wasted in our basement, alone.  Listening to music, cruising the internet.  Texting friends, calling people I typically didn't have the energy to talk to.  I felt like I could be \"happy\" and \"normal\", and do the things I knew I needed to do (e.g. call someone I had been meaning to reach out to), but when sober, didn't always want to do.  \n\nAnd I drank to get fucked up.  I wasn't under some disillusionment that I was going to drink to have two glasses of chilled white wine and call it a day.  No, the planning involved in this wouldn't have been worth it for only two glasses of wine.  These events had a minimum of a box of white wine (preferably Black Box pinot grigio), and then at least another bottle or two of brut champagne.  Dry white wines.  At the end, that's the only thing that could sit ~ok~ with me.  Other things weren't \"working\".  And I liked the type of drunk I could get with wine. \nI also coupled my drink with Blu menthol e-cigs (which on their own, sober, make me feel like absolute shit).  By the way, I wasn't a smoker, a former smoker, or someone trying to quit (When I drank, I often let people assume and take pity for me, for the fact that I must have been a \"former smoker\" as I clutched my ecigs).  Somewhere after I graduated law school, a law school cohort a year ahead of me, who had become a practicing attorney, and himself, a problem drinker--said that smoking ecigs helped him in his office during the day.  And it was much more acceptable and easier to hide than an actual cig or chewing tobacco--which was what he preferred.  This guy had been a childhood friend of mine.  I know that within the last year or so he has had one bout of pancreatitis which lead him into hospital care.  I'm not sure where he is with those things now.  I don't speak with him much and consider him an acquaintance.  I do wish him well though.\nAnyway.  What I learned was, since my body had been previously burnt out from stimulants and caffeine, nicotine could cut my alcohol intake.  A little.  Probably minutely.  But, I bought into it.  And soon enough, I paired my drinks with ecigs.  \n\nLast spring (2017), I had a bit of sobriety on my own.  Less than two full months.  It was a serene time.  I remember feeling awful when I knew I was going to break my sobriety.  I hadn't reached out to anyone or told anyone about going sober, so turns out, it was pretty fucking easy to break my sobriety.  After that relapse, the summer was kind of . . . blurry.  I had a busy summer with work.  Where I excelled.  My drinking did not get in the way there.  I mean, I think. I'm sure it leaked in, if I'm being honest (which I am).\n\nI remember feeling disappointed that I had broke my sobriety before I got my new puppy.  My fianc\u00e9 gave me a puppy for my birthday.  I felt great guilt every time I drank after we got her.  I thought it could be a new leaf for me to turn over.  Get sober for the dog. \n\nNot how it works, guys.  I mean.  It can.  I've heard of many a dog as a Higher Power before (in fact, my dog isn't just \"the dog\", but the love of my life, and quite frankly, part of my Higher Power).  But, I didn't have those tools yet.\n\nAnyway.  The culmination of my drinking spiked at the end of summer/early fall of last year.  I found myself doing things that became more concerning.  Nothing that got me into grave trouble or danger.  But.  Concerning.\n\nI can't remember the circumstances, but I had one afternoon off.  Knew I had an extra bottle of champagne around.  Drank it.  Realized my tolerance was more fucked than usual.  Was drunker than I had \"planned to be\" or that I could hide.  And had to think of what to do before my fianc\u00e9 came home from work that afternoon.  I was supposed to be traveling that week for work.  But only a couple of nights, and not that far away from where we lived.  So, naturally, I called him to tell him that I was unexpectedly needing to leave for one of these trips out of town, and that I was sorry I wasn't going to get to say bye to him.  He bought it.  I threw together a bag of clothes, got a bunch of fast food, and got a box of wine.  Drove my ass to a hotel right in the town we live in.  Not even a necessarily nice one.  Kind of a sad one.  Not very well lit.  \nIt did have a refrigerator, though.  And that kept my wine chilled.  So, for the night, I was safe to drink my boxed wine in a plastic hotel cup, watered down by hotel ice machine ice cubes.\nWhat I forgot to pack was, unfortunately, my anxiety medication.  Which I did not take when I was drinking--because you know, death.\n\nOh--I should mention.  I have had serious anxiety issues my whole life.  Didn't realize it, until it manifested itself into full blown panic attacks at age 21.   But, like many of you here, and us in the world of alkies, yeah.  I had debilitating anxiety.\n\nSo, after passing out from a pretty lackluster night drinking watered down wine in a shitty hotel.  I woke up at 5:30am with screeching anxiety.  And for the first time in a long time, an upset stomach.\nI panicked when I couldn't find my anxiety meds and realized I would have to wait at least 2 hours until I could drive my sorry ass home to get them.  I had a very hard time driving when I was in the middle of a panic attack and was worried the anxiety would be too strong before I could make it home.   Again, I had to wait until my fianc\u00e9 was out of the house.  Because, otherwise, what were the lies all for?\n(Did I say earlier I hadn't put myself in danger when drinking--because that was a load of fucking bullshit if I ever heard one).\nAnyway.  On top of anxiety.  I needed to puke.  Something I never had to do after drinking.  I prided myself on it, in fact.\nBut here I was.  In the shower, trying to warm up to take the chills away (from the anxiety--and withdrawal), and oh, oops, I'm puking in the shower.  And oh. Look at that.  The drain in this shower isn't working.  I'm actually showering in my own puke.  Cool.\nI proceeded to get out of the shower.  Kind of cleaned out the puke but not really.  (When in college, I briefly did housekeeping, so my apologies to the housekeeping staff that morning--truly).\nAnd then I had to wait.  Wait until my fianc\u00e9 got out of that damn house.\nIn the meantime, I puked a few more times.  Once in the sink as I brushed my teeth.  Maybe twice more in the toilet.  Can't really remember all the details.\n\nWe had gotten cameras for inside our house, and had outside security cameras.  The inside ones to watch our new puppy while we were at work.  I decided I would use those to help me gage when my fianc\u00e9 finally left the house.\nI decided I needed to get on the road before my anxiety fully kicked in, and felt it would be best to hide on the street on the other side of our house as I waited for my fianc\u00e9 to leave, so I could get those god damn fucking anxiety meds.\n\nI waited at least 30 minutes on that side street.  Waiting and watching on our inside camera.  Watching my fianc\u00e9 have a peaceful morning.  Shuffle around carefully and happily (he isn't a drinker and went full teetotaler quite some time ago).  He got to have a nice long goodbye with our pup before he went off to work.  It all looked so, happy.  Nice.  Normal.  Peaceful.\nI cried as I sat on the other street watching this as I was shaking like a leaf from my anxiety and withdrawal.\nI wanted what he had.  Peace and serenity.  Not this fucking chaos.  \nTo be there in the mornings and enjoy it with them.\nHe finally left.  And even left early.  So as to get to work early.  Unlike me, chronically running a little late, but telling myself my long hours and huge workload, gave me that excuse.\nHe left.  I ran into the house.  Cried upon seeing my dog who was confused when I picked her up and kissed her and hugged her.  Took my meds.  Called my office to say I was running a little late, for god knows what reason.\nAnd knew I was fucked.\n\nThat wasn't the end of my drinking.  But it certainly was a marker for me of what I considered a bottom.  \nI continued to drink more often, two times a week, instead of two times a month after that incident, which really then lasted, about a month and a half longer (the drinking).\nI closed out my drinking with two more experiences--one, a work trip, wherein I drank so much I missed a ton of awesome opportunities for courses I could have sat in on.  Hid out in my hotel room, when I could have explored.\nAnd then had my final drunk, in my old drinking spot.  My basement.  Hanging out with idiots on YouNow.  People I didn't even know.  But felt comfortable enough to talk with while I was drinking.  \nThat last drunk, I knew.  It was different.  I had gone to the liquor store hating myself a little more than I ever had.  Hating the people in there more than ever.  Even as I poured the drink, my anxiety roared.  \nIt was no longer fun.\n\nI texted a friend I knew who had been in recovery and involved in AA for a long time.  She asked if I wanted to come to a meeting.  I went to one.  Barely 24 hours sober.  At that meeting, a colleague of mine (who I did not know was sober), was receiving her 18 year sobriety chip.  She was surprised to see me.  I was surprised to see her.  I sent a congrats email to her the next Monday at work.  \nWe have since built an extremely nice friendship, and I adore her.  \n\nShe got to watch me receive my 6 month chip this last weekend.  And was very proud for me.  My whole group was.  \n\nA couple of women I've gotten to know in recovery have recently relapsed.  Some have tried to come back.  It seems harder.  Guilty-er.  Less fun and light.  I know they can get it back, but I can see their disappointment.  Others have fallen off.  One in a psych ward.  Another, kicked out of her kids' home.  \n\nOver the course of my last 6.5 months of sobriety, I've had lots of ups and downs.  My anxiety has gotten better.  Much better.  I'm better overall, at handling things.  \n\nI feel that, karma/the universe seems to agree with me better as I lead this life of sobriety.  I don't know if it's true.  But.  It seems to.  \n\nI don't live 100% honestly.  I have still told lies that I have not worked through in my 5th and 11th steps.  \n\nI've worked through my steps fully and often feel guilty that I'm not doing enough or that my sponsor, who is sweet and wonderful, thinks I could be doing more, not just for myself, but for others like me.  And I know she is right.\n\nBut.  I'm doing what I can, on most days.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9, as the title denotes, happened to propose to me.  Unrelated to the sobriety.  But, honestly, maybe not.  I asked him the other day as I was struggling to tell him I was planning a relapse, how my sobriety has affected him.  He told me his own life has gotten better because of it.  He doesn't have to feel as worried and anxious for me.  He cares a lot about me.  It would break his heart if I went back to hurting myself.\n\nInitially, I didn't lose weight.  In fact, I was getting thicker it seemed.  But then, after his proposal (and also, feeling more comfortable after the first couple months of sobriety), found it pretty damn easy to knock off 19 pounds (I now sit about 15 pounds down--but it can fluctuate).  \n\nI look hella good, y'all.  I gotta say.  I look pretty good.\n\nSo why on earth, in the last week or so, have I been suddenly feeling almost \"unable\" to think forward the thoughts of relapsing?\n\nWell, I have two travel plans in the next month.  This coming weekend, back home, to a lake, which I have done now, at least a few times sober.  But one, requiring flight, in a few weeks.  This type of travel and business travel, I have not done yet, sober.  I'm future tripping.\n\nAnd maybe other things, too.  Getting caught up.  I'm just.  I'm caught up.  Instead of letting myself live.  I'm ready to self-sabotage.  The \"ism\" in my mind has lead me to believe something I spent 6 months knowing was untrue--that the few hours of \"relief\" I artificially get from a poison doesn't outweigh the after affects. \n\nAnd I needed to share this all with you.  Whoever is so brave and kind enough to read this to the end.\n\nI am struggling the worst I have in sobriety.  And I really want to believe, I will make it through the other side.  I will make it to my wedding this summer, continuing on this little train of sobriety.  One 24 hours at a time.  \n\nI guess that's the kicker.  I just have today.  I certainly can allow myself to think about my wedding, how disappointing it would be to fuck up before such an important event in my life.  One I will share with the man who is so proud of me for who I am, and the sober life I now proudly lead.\n\nAnd the work I do.  For a very long time, I felt terribly guilty for the work I do professionally, and the fact that I couldn't honestly look people in the eye and talk about behavioral health and addiction, knowing I myself was struggling.\n\nIt just, it all doesn't compute.\n\nIt seems pretty worth it to stick the course.  Even though, I promise you guys, it is so fucking hard right now.  And as my fianc\u00e9 leaves tomorrow night and I am alone, without he or my puppy until Monday.  Jesus.  This is going to be potentially hella fucking hard.  But I have you guys.  I have my sponsor.  I have folks to reach out to.  I have books I need to re-read for my own benefit.  Allen Carr, This Naked Mind, memoirs, non-AA and AA related reading material to carry me through this weekend.  A weekend that's supposed to be sunny.  Where I have the luxury of sitting on a brand new pontoon, on my favorite body of water.  And read.  Enjoy life.  Breathe.\n\nHow the fuck would I not choose sobriety?  At least for the sake of that god damn fucking 3 hour drive I have to make to and from where I'm going, that would be a bitch of a sad drive home if I drink this weekend.  \n\nCan I end on that?  That visual image is enough to keep me sober.  Fuck's sake.  \n\nAnd you guys, too, on a sentimental note.  You guys keep me going.  We can make our lives how we want it, and I see a lot of people here doing that. \n\nI feel a duty here, to be one less person who has to say, \"hey guys, sorry, relapsed.  It sucked.

   "selftext": "So. I hit 100 days today. Here are a few observations.\n\n- Apparently, this landmark has been weighing on/occupying my mind, in some way, for some time. \n\nI began the day with a nightmare. In this nightmare, I had, what I recall to be, one beer. One. And my thought process during was this: \"now I have to start all over again at day one.\" \n\nI can't really describe dreams like this. I know we all have them. It's hard to really put into words how terrifying they are. I've had them before in my previous goes at sobriety. This one felt... different. I know this is the last time I will have to try when it comes to sobriety. I suppose that's what made it particularly frightening. You're \"there,\" but *you're not really there. In your dream, you're actually drunk. And you don't like it.* Waking up to reality, where you're not actually drunk, is the most amazing, freeing feeling in the world. But you still have to watch your step, because you don't want that dream, *that nightmare,* to become your reality once more.\n\n- Every day is a little bit better. But there are days where it sucks. You think you can go back out and handle it. But every day, you deal with it. You begin to see the light. It shines brighter and brighter each day. And you know the mistakes in your past do not reflect the new, real you. Other people might still see you that way, and some days, you may even see you that way. It's hard to forgive yourself, and sometimes you need to be forgiven by other people in to move on from the harm they or you have caused in your life. \n\nI'm still struggling with that last part. Sometimes, there are one or more people you need to ask forgiveness from and be forgiven by in order to truly move on. \n\nSometimes, however, you won't get it. But through therapy, AA, or whatever coping mechanism works for you, you're able to move past it. The wounds you give others create wounds in you. Finding a way to heal those invisible abrasions is your only way to true happiness.\n\n- You may find other things to replace alcohol with. Mine have been cigarettes, therapy, and (occasionally) weed. I'm looking for healthier ways to get past the pain I've caused and replace the two not-so-awesome ones in that list. They're only temporary bandaids. Start reading. Start writing. Paint. Draw. Join a gym. Focus on work. Find a hobby or rediscover old ones. Treat yourself right. Because stopping drinking is only the first step.\n\n- Bad things will still happen in your life. Murphy's Law still dictates mine. My boyfriend left me because of my anger issues. My bipolar mood swings have become worse. I sometimes fixate on certain unhealthful things, like running away and starting a new life. Those, again, are only temporary solutions. Even if you run away, you and your problems are still you and your problems. \n\nA change of scenery and/or a new name won't make any of that go away. You are still you. Your problems are still your problems. Focus instead on the good parts of your life and, eventually, those will begin to overshadow the bad parts. You will come out a better, stronger person when you accept and face the challenges in your life head on. You can begin by quitting drinking, seeking help, and by refusing to continue making excuses and reaching for a bottle. \n\nThat's it, really. I am far away from being okay. But while I'm finally about to admit that I'm not okay, I know that, eventually, I *will* be okay. \n\nTo those starting out: you're in for a long battle. In fact, you're in for a lifelong one. But you absolutely, positively, 100% can do it. You'll begin to rediscover the old you, the pre-alcohol you, the REAL you. \n\nMy own mother once told me that she never believed I could stop drinking. Said I \"lacked the fortitude.\" Her mother was a lifelong alcoholic and she witnessed it firsthand growing up. At that time, I also believed, deep down, that I never could, either.\n\nHowever, once I hit that spot, years later, there was no going back for me. I'm glad I'm about to prove her, my friends, those I've hurt, and, most importantly, *myself* wrong.\n\nSo for 101, 102, 103, etc... I will not drink with you. And I most certainly will not drink with you today.",

   "selftext": "Hey, does anyone know how I can overcome this? because my family definitely doesn't have money for any kind of help. This is also really venty, so if you dont have any help, it's not a big deal.\n\nRecently I've felt like I'm being watched by fictional characters, \\(I know, makes no sense\\) buts its gotten to the point that I really start to feel like they're there, watching me, and judging what I'm doing, it's gotten so bad that I won't get up from where I'm sitting, or do something I think they'll find stupid, or weird.    \n\nIf I go sit where I think they are, I genuinely feels like I'm invading their space, and that I'm in them or something, its really messing with me, I keep telling myself that it isn't real, that its absolutely nuts, but it wont work, no matter what i do I can feel them sitting on that bed, or wherever they are. \n\nAlso having problems with what might? be OCD, every since I was young, I'd count up to certain numbers on my palm, \\(until it was a *good* number\\) only step in certain places, step a certain amount of times so its either an even number, or a number I don't think is bad, things have to be shut off a certain amount of times, and closed a certain way. But recently, it's gotten worse, to the point that it's part of my everyday life. \n\nWhen I was younger, my \\(now deceased\\) alcoholic dad would abuse my mother, throwing things, yelling, hitting her, etc. \n\nI once watched her be choked\n\nand I think it might have messed me up, I can't handle doors slamming, or being yelled at. my mom has gotten a boyfriend now, but the thing is she only introduced him to us once, and he moved in like two days after, and idk, it was just very uncomfortable.\n\nI'm also very frustrated with her because of our schooling, we where homeschooled, but even when my dad was alive she'd be pretty flaky with teaching us, and now, nearly 7 something years of absolutely ZERO schooling, she's decided to pick it back up. \\(*After saying she would multiple times over the years\\)* and I don't know a lot of things! like basic math, and whatever the hell else you learn in school, it makes me feel very stupid, and I know I should teach myself, but I don't have the motivation for that, what 15 yr old does? Just the fact that she neglected us for so long makes me so upset, and where we where living? a trailer, \\(not necessarily a bad thing!\\) but it was terrible, after my dad killed himself our house just FILLED with trash, too the point that my mom, and all of my siblings slept in the living room for multiple years, I had no friends, no contact with anyone outside of our family, and she did not handle her money well, always saying we'd move, but instead, going and buying things for the garden she barely kept alive, we lived in absolutely horrid conditions, and had a pile behind the couch of our clothes, we'd wear the same dirty clothes for MONTHS until she went and washed some, and I mean EVERY clothing item was dirty, it was truly horrendous. After cancer took our baby brother is when I think everything exploded, when my dad's depression worsened, and when my mom stopped caring.\n\nIt was, and to a certain extent IS so terrible, I feel like she's stripped my entire young childhood from me, it makes me wonder how she could have even loved us with the way she acted,  she's so flaky and yells over the smallest things! its so frustrating. tell me, was this neglect? \n\nI know the abuse definitely effected her, but does that excuse the things she's done, and HASN'T done?\n\nI can't find the motivation to do things, and until recently I would self\\-harm. I don't shower until it's absolutely necessary, or really take care of myself, I think I might be depressed?\n\nThis part might sound a little nuts, but I think I might have been raped and don't remember it, I've thought about it jokingly multiple times, but when someone on a subreddit said it had happened to them, I teared up, and got a feeling that it may be true, but I can't access impossible memories, and a part of me keeps doubting myself, and that I might just want something to be wrong with me.\n\nI feel like my life wasn't really that bad, and I'm overreacting.\n\nThanks if you took the time to read this shitstorm, and any advice whatsoever would be very appreciated.\n\n**TDLR: I feel like fictional characters are watching and judging me, think I might have OCD, and I'm very frustrated over the neglect by our mother. I also think I might have been raped, and I'm just suppressing it.**",

It was never a problem for him and while he was drunk plenty of times it was never like it was for me. When I said I wanted to quit he was incredibly supportive and has helped me through many situations by being sober with me so I wouldn't feel alone. He listened to me talk for weeks after quitting about being scared, anxious and depressed and feeling like I was a miserable worthless person. He was my rock and has done and continues to do everything he can to support me through this. He told me this week he is also done drinking for good, mainly because he started on some meds he doesn't want to mix with booze but also to support me. This is a wonderful gift he is giving me and 90% of me feels loved and supported. But there is part of me that is just irritated that it's so easy for him. Like\"I'm just going to quit drinking to be a nice person no big deal\". I know it is irrational but it feels almost like he's flaunting how easy it is (he is not doing anything to make me feel that way it's just in my head). My life was turned upside down when I decided to quit, it has shaken out well now that the dust has settled but it was (and still is) an intense challenge and something i struggled to do for a really long time. He is wonderful and loving and supportive and I'm over here being grumpy because he isn't an addict and that is a ridiculous way to feel. I just needed to vent these feeling so the wouldn't just grow in the darkness.",

   "selftext": "Ok this is a long one so please bare with me, I\u2019ve been sitting on this question for a while, this is actually the third time I\u2019ve written this out &amp; not deleted it before posting. For some background, I\u2019m 27, male &amp; about 6 ft 2in tall.\n\nA little over a year ago, I weighed in at 283 pounds. I have always been big but never that big so I did something about it, I got married on the 28th April this year so with that goal in mind I dieted like crazy &amp; began walking/running. By my wedding day, I had lost 120 pounds and weighed in at about 163 pounds. I had a routine sorted that had me sitting between 163-167 pounds in the month leading up to it.\n\nSounds great right? Yes, I\u2019m unbelievably proud of myself, every time I\u2019ve tried dieting I would last 6 weeks &amp; lose 20-30 pounds then fall off the wagon &amp; pile it all back on. But aside from physically feeling fantastic &amp; having more self confidence than ever before (I wear XS/S clothes now instead of XXL) it has become incredibly mentally draining on me to keep up appearances &amp; stay strict on myself,\n\nLet me explain, as I said I have always been big, I\u2019ve always loved food, like really loved food. Problem is now, I feel like I can\u2019t even have a cheat meal or ingredient without feeling guilty or like I\u2019ll pile it all back on. I currently get on the scales twice a day &amp; constantly stress about the number that awaits me each morning (which I record on a sheet on the fridge)\n\nMy current diet is the following, every day without exception:\n-2 hard boiled eggs during the week or muesli &amp; fruit on weekends for breakfast, always between 7:30am-8:30am\n-Either a tin of tuna or salmon &amp; some vegetables for lunch, always between 12:30pm-1:30pm\n-Either salmon/steak/chicken/lamb and vegetables for dinner, always between 6pm-6:30pm\n-Snacks in between when I need them (I try to mix it up) include a banana, some almonds or dried fruit\n-Only ever drink water\n\nI also exercise at least 5 days a week now with one of the following on any day, trying to mix it up &amp; keep it fresh:\n-1-2 hours walking\n-Half hour running/rowing\n-45min-1hr in the gym (only started this very recently)*\n-120-150 Pushups/Sit-ups every day \n\n\nWhat I need is to feel like I can get back into some sense of normal. It is affecting my social relationships &amp; social life. I just got back from my honeymoon where I stuck to the same diet as above &amp; didn\u2019t even touch an alcoholic beverage. I avoid going out with friends because generally that involves drinks and/or bad food. My family &amp; friends are worried about me &amp; think I look borderline sick skinny at times even though I look down and still somewhat see that huge guy. I feel like if I eat bread again or some ice cream I\u2019ll balloon out again so I avoid it all together. My fear is that the routine I have has me maintaining this weight so if I slack, I\u2019ll blow back out. The couple of times I have slipped I can\u2019t help myself and end up pigging out because I can\u2019t avoid turning 1-2 slices of pizza into 6-7. I have my meals for each day always planned out &amp; it has me actually trying to kill time between meals so the next one comes faster.\n\nI\u2019m now stuck with the problem of \u2018how do I convince myself to become \u2018normal\u2019 again.\u2019 People continue to ask me when I am going to stop &amp; how much longer, but I just can\u2019t find the courage to try a healthy balance. I know I should be allowed a cheat meal here or there, I want to be able to go out with friends or to a restaurant &amp; not have to look up the menu beforehand to see if it has something I\u2019m allowed to eat. I know this is probably a stupid problem to have &amp; I apologise for spewing this long post out but truthfully, it feels good to at least put this into words, even if no one reads it. If anyone else has experienced something similar or has any ideas that might help manage things better I\u2019m all ears.\n\nTL;DR Fat guy got skinny, maybe a little too skinny, struggling to get back into a \u2018normal\u2019 diet without fear of blowing out",

   "selftext": "I know and can admit me being pissed is selfish too. This is years of built up frustration and will be a long rant. November, I finally get my 30 year old boyfriend to move out and away from his dependent, life sucking family, only to find out, literally 3 days later that we\u2019re pregnant! It hasn\u2019t been easy, but I can tell our baby and our lives have become the priority over his family.\n\nI stupidly encouraged him to speak to his dad after he ended up in jail for the millionth time. We got stuck bailing him out of jail and taking on that financial burden. But his dad was dying in there (from self induced liver failure from years of being an alcoholic) and we saved him. It was an unfair financial strain on us with a baby on the way, considering he has 3 other capable siblings, but we did it and he\u2019s getting the care he needs now. It was fine.\n\nHere we are a few more months down the road, a little more than a month to go for baby to be here. Just had our baby shower. We\u2019ve got our finances figured and getting prepared to put together baby\u2019s nursery in our spare room in our 2 bedroom townhouse. I\u2019m in hard core nesting mode and have checklists galore to get ready for baby. We\u2019re excited!\n\nAnd then it happens, finally, after years of a gorgeous huge house they couldn\u2019t afford, but refused to leave even after struggling to come up with rent every single month. They\u2019re getting evicted. By the end of this month. Less than 2 weeks. Whatever will these 4 grown ass people (plus 3 yappy snappy terrible little dogs) do? Oh well, I guess they\u2019ll have to move in with us if they don\u2019t find a place says my bf. But just his mom and Dad...\n\nThese parents who haven\u2019t parented him, pretty much his whole life, who made him struggle and work to take care of their grown asses as soon as he was able. To be fair, he did ask me if I would be ok with it. But what could I say? No? Fuck your piece of shit parents, let them be homeless? I\u2019m not heartless. Sure, I\u2019m being selfish because I would rather them be someone else\u2019s problem than take away the space we\u2019ve worked for, that should be our child\u2019s. He and I have put in so much work to get where we are, rebuilding our credit, learning to manage money, saving money, refinancing our vehicles, etc basically becoming adults. Which his parents have just refused to do their whole lives and decided it was easier to live off the system and their children. I\u2019m working up until I pop this kid out and only taking a month off. I\u2019ve been taking classes (before and while prego) in order to get an associates to add to my bachelors so I can do better at my job and possibly after this kid is here, get an even better job. My bf works his ass off in a physical truck driving job and has been trying to make more money and get promoted in anyway he can. \n\nHere they come though, on their disability (yes, you can get disability from drinking yourself to near death apparently) and non working at less than 60 year old selves to come fuck up everything we\u2019ve worked towards. I\u2019m beyond pissed and horrified that grown ass adults would do this to their kid, who is about to have his very first kid and has worked so hard to basically get away from them. But I can\u2019t tell him any of this, because those are his parents. I understand why he feels the need to do it, but they are the most selfish people I\u2019ve ever met and I\u2019ll never forgive them for this. It\u2019s eating me up inside and I had to get it out, but I\u2019ll never admit it to him. ",

   "selftext": "I am amazed at myself for staying sober. I never thought I could do this, had tried so many times and failed that I didn\u2019t trust myself. It felt so daunting and scary to stop drinking. I had realized that I used alcohol as an escape, never facing my fears and emotions, much rather getting drunk. Whenever something happened that didn\u2019t feel good I would drink. I knew this had to stop. I could see that If I kept at it I would slowly ruin my health, my relationships, my business, my looks, everything. I knew it was time, but I felt so scared. But this time it felt different, this time I meant it and promised myself I would do whatever I had to to get and stay sober. It meant reading books about alcoholism, visualizing and affirming, it meant countless hours of meditations and \u201astop addiction\u2018 self hypnosis (on YouTube, I loooooooooved it) and writing my sobriety journal every day. The main difference this time was that I was finally ready to stop running away from my fears and emotions. Instead I faced them mindfully. Really sat with them, felt into them, let them flow through me and finally run out of stream. In the beginning it was such an overwhelming and scary business to face all these emotions that I had pushed down and numbed for so long. But day by day it felt better, and one day I realized that I actually enjoy all those emotions, even the so called bad ones. Feeling them meant I was actually alive and growing up. Doing all this work made me feel so proud of myself, a great change to the self-loathing I had become so used to. The added energy and clear headedness is a huge bonus also. \nIt wasn\u2019t easy and I really struggled a lot in the beginning. But with every craving I overcame, it got a little easier. And the cravings got less and less, which kind of surprised me. And no, my life is not all roses and rainbows, in fact it still sucks on a regular basis. BUT it would suck so much more with a hangover and the constant self-hate. And taking it one day, one hour, one minute at a time has proved to be a great tactic to face even the worst days. \nSo, a huge thanks to all of you, I really appreciate this place of understanding and cheering on. And I will not drink with you today. ",

Right off the bat, I know that this is not normal and signals potential liver damage. \n\nIs this already very high or just a mild elevation? Should I be really worried? \n\nI\u2019m male, 21, 5\u20193\u201d, 67 kg and for the past 6 months or so, I\u2019ve been drinking a lot and indulging myself in fatty foods and soft drinks etc. During that 6 months, I\u2019ve been drinking an average of 4 - 8 bottles of beer or a few shots of hard liquor per week. I mostly drink on weekends, sometimes on weekdays, but never on a daily basis. I used to smoke, but gradually quit. I\u2019ve not smoked a single cigarette for the past 2 months.\n\nAny answers, advice, opinions will be highly appreciated. Thank you. :)",

I just really have a hard time dealing with the relapse. Struggling with feelings of \"weakness, shame and sadness\" versus \"Be kind to yourself, shame and guilt won't help you\" etc etc. At the moment I have no cravings at all. Having anxiety sinds day one, but I don't need the urge to numb it \\(my own experience tells me this day will come though, even if it takes months\\). I think I have no cravings at the moment because my anxiety and sadness also have to do with some bad things that happened in the weeks that lead up to me choosing the horrible option 8 days ago to cave in to drink. I know drinking didn't help, it only made me feel worse. I just have been feeling very sad the last 7 days. Not optimistic, relieved or even partly happy as I experienced the last time I quit. That scares me. It scares me that maybe I have given up on my life in general. I don't know. Maybe I'm overreacting. The last few days I've tried to do the things that can help me. I've called my old therapist, made an appointment. Called my doctor. Checked out the times of AA meetings \\(didn't go yet\\). Told someone close what happened. Came back here on SD. Tried to hydrate, eat healthy, sleep, shower, get up in the morning. But I feel like a ghost with waves of axienty flowing through her body a few times a day. I cry a lot. Don't know why I am posting this kind of depressing message, don't want to offend anyone. Maybe someone can relate. Thank you for reading. I will not drink with you today. ",

   "selftext": "Hi everyone, I've been lurking on this sub for months and months trying to find advice and ways of helping my brother, but some direct help would be very appreciated, I apologise for the long read in advance!\n\nSo a quick bit of background info; my brother is 32, and has drank very heavily since he was 16-17 maybe. He joined the military young and from there he moved in to a very successful job abroad (He's from the uk), but in September last year he called to tell us he was moving home. \n\nHe confessed he had lost his job due to getting caught drink driving for a 2nd time, and within a week he was back home living with us, and we realised just how bad his drinking was. He has barely squeaked out a weeks worth of sober days in the last 8 months, and has been sleeping on our sofa this entire time, when we initially thought it would be 2-3 weeks to get back on his feet and find his own place. \n\nHe came home with zero savings from an almost 100k a year job, and has recently (the last 2 months) found himself a good job again. However, everything about his behaviour and habits is telling me he's headed in the exact same direction again, and it seems inevitable He will end up losing this job too. He's currently not driving, which is a relief, but it means I'm driving him to work at 5.30am before I start work, and by 7-8pm when I come home he is usually passed out drunk on the sofa. When he works late I drive to pick him up at 10pm, I have done literally everything I can to help him get back on his feet but he just spends all his money on booze and is only sober during work hours. \n\nWe (my mum and myself) have spoken to him at least 10 times about quitting drinking, we've threatened to kick him out and told him how much hassle he causes being drunk every day, but nothing seems to work. We've tried the soft and caring approach and the hard approach.\n\n When he's sober he's smart and it's good to have my brother back after 12 years of him mostly being away, but I only get my brother for about 10% of the time, the rest of the time I get an alcoholic who is barely present. \n\nHave any of you got experiences of trying to help a family member, Or maybe a family member did something to you that finally broke through and made you want to quit? Any help would be hugely appreciated, I simply don't know what the solution is here, and I don't just want to kick him out and see him spiral further. \n\nSorry for the big read!",

   "selftext": "Hey everyone, \n\nI am ecstatic. Liquor sales in NM here stop at midnight. Usually I sneak out around 2200 under the guise of getting an energy drink or something and grab a pint of Smirnoff or more. Last night I spent all night cleaning baby bottles, preparing the next day's worth, cleaning out the fridge, power cleaning the basement, and doing all the laundry in the house while my wife slept. \\(I'm a night owl on baby leave so I stay up at night with the baby downstairs while she sleeps upstairs then nap throughout the day between errands\\). Tonight I rearranged all of the DVDs, dusted, plan on organizing the pantry, and cupboards. \n\nHoly shit, the productivity. Usually at this time, I'm buzzed or more playing a video game or lazily browsing Reddit distracting myself, begrudgingly getting up to do some quick chore that NEEDS to be done before getting back to it. Then  wake up hazy at like 0800 and do it again the next night. \n\nI am so happy with this amount of focus and energy. Granted, I did also quit Nicotine a few days before alcohol \\(May 15th\\), so I am looking for anything to distract myself from throwing in a chew, but, I'm not just leaning on alcohol to get my mind off the nicotine like the first few days after quitting chewing. I am putting my focus towards productive things that benefit my family and it makes me incredibly proud. Between the withdrawals from Nicotine and this very proud feeling, I am finding it bearable to avoid my two former vices. \n\nKeep rocking on everyone. This was my happy moment of the last few days, and I hope you all have your own and share them with us for moto. ",

   "selftext": "I'm continuing a very recent topic of mine regarding compulsive masturbation as a way to get away (extinguish) from shame-lust: https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/8lhaeu/compulsive_masturbationejaculation_to_lower/\n\nI'm looking to see how going into that frenzy or binge feels like for everybody because for me it's uncontrollable and once i'm triggered it's very difficult to stop and the more i'm triggered and it builds up the harder it is. It's probably similar to what an alcoholic feels when near a drink, a drug user when near drugs etc. \n\nMy question is why are we different from the normal population? Probably most people feel lust in their everyday life and they can delay it. Lust doesn't send them in an unstoppable frenzy. They can pick up lust later or not, they don't have to act on it immediately. They don't have to extinguish it.\n\nMy reasoning is lust for us is extremely linked to shame, they're basically intertwined, so when lust is triggered, so is shame. And to get rid of that shame, since we can't just let shame go, we have to go and deplete ourselves of lust... which makes shame gone as well... until the next time.\n\nLust is not just porn related, i've seen many stories here and i know of mine as well where regular sex triggers this frenzy and we end up relapsing. So why is that? I'm thinking it's still shame related and since we can't properly let go and have sex and exhaust all the lust (because of shame), lust still lingers and we have to let go of it after. I think in my case at least sex has always felt a lot like porn. I also have sexual anhedonia. I remember just one time with my ex gf when i could let myself go and have an orgasm in which i was completely depleted after and relaxed, went straight to sleep and didn't have any urge later.\n\nBasically in the case of porn addicts, libido is never spent or exhausted because shame bottlenecks it.\n\nIn my case at least, each sex attempt, be it masturbation to porn/fantasy or real sex, i never feel I can truly let go and consume my libido. I get hot and horny, it builds up, on release i can let go of at most 5%, i'm still horny, go again, more builds up, and so on, to the point where i'm left more sexually frustrated than at the beginning, but the body can't physically keep up.

   "selftext": "I quit drinking after I got a DUI on the way home from a date in January of 2017. I'd had 3 beers, blew a .04, and spent the night in jail. On my lawyer's advice I went to treatment for 90 days and when I got out I learned that the DA's office had decided not to prosecute me. 17 months later I'm still sober and mostly happy. I've learned a ton about myself, my friends/family, and my higher power. Overall I'm pretty grateful for the time I've spent in the program. The problem is I'm still not sure if I ever actually belonged in the program, despite the fact that I've met some great people and can actually relate to a few of them. I've been pretty unmanageable my whole life \\(even before I started drinking\\), and there was a time when it was the only tool I had to deal with the shit that was happening in my life, but I've never actually felt powerless over alcohol. I honestly can't tell if I'm an alcoholic or if I just enjoy meetings.\n\nI know that nobody can tell me if I'm an alcoholic or not, and I'm not looking for someone to take my inventory for me or anything. I just need some perspective because I really don't know who I can talk to about this. My friends \\(and even ex\\-girlfriends\\) outside the program say they never noticed a problem to begin with. My family is worried I'll get into trouble again. People in the rooms tell me that \"nobody is here by accident.\" My therapist says I'm just trying to justify a relapse. It just feels like everyone is either too close or too far from the situation to talk straight with me, so I figured strangers might be the best bet. On one hand I feel like I've gained so much from my AA experience, but on the other I don't know if I belong here or not.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for reaching out, everyone. I definitely got the perspective I came for. I\u2019ve had some people say some things I can really relate to as well as some classic Big Book advice. I\u2019m going to share at my next meeting on this and see what happens. This has been helpful, so thanks for the service work!",

   "selftext": " For those who do not know Alanon is the \u201csister\u201d program to AA for family and friends of alcoholics.  It uses the same twelve steps, but the focus there is of taking care of yourself, learning how to set boundaries, and not accepting the blame the alcoholic often wants to heap on you.   \n \n\nFor some reason I don't quite understand at their yearly anniversary meetings they invite an AA speaker in.  I've done this a few times over the years, and it's tricky. This is not the place to tell war stories, to 'qualify'. Instead, as I see it \u2013 it's a place for sharing my experience, strength, and hope \u2013 and last night, the commonalities many of us share. \n\n  \n  I spoke of powerlessness \u2013 that at one point I was incapable of keeping the promises I made to myself that I would not drink that day.  Or the promise that I would 'take it easy'.  I drank. I got drunk.   No matter how sincere I had been.  I spoke of having elastic lines \u2013 so I did not have to cross them.   I mentioned advanced degrees in rationalization.  \n  \n\nThen I switched to the real powerlessness \u2013 over everything else.  People in particular, wife, kids, boss, the guy who is trying to merge, the customer with an attitude.  I could not change them.  Sure I can ram my fender into the guy who is trying to get in front of me, but that's a lesson learned pretty quickly as we both watch traffic pass and argue on the side of the road..   \n \n\n A quick note: This was not totally foreign to me. I have enough alcoholism in my family to 'qualify' for Alanon \\(many of us do\\) and have attended these meetings on and off over the years.  There is a great deal I have learned from them. In particular: **That I can start my day over at any time.  That somebody's opinion of me is none of my business. That renting space in my head to someone does neither of us any good.**     \n \n\n I kept it short, I kept it upbeat \\(and they did not laugh nearly as easily as an AA room would have\\).  My main point was that the only thing I can change in any situation is my attitude.  Then, after about ten minutes I ended.   \n  \n\nI was followed by two Alanon speakers \u2013 and was reminded of just how much damage we can do with our drinking/drugging.  They spoke of 'waiting for THE phone call' they described the heartbreak of watching children destroy their own lives \u2013 and the emotional wreckage spreading to parents and beyond.  They spoke of love being chipped at and eroded by anger \u2013 and having to let go and watch the child they love follow a dangerous dark path.  None of the speakers last night described having to at the age of 60 step in and raise grandchildren that were being neglected or worse by addict parents \u2013 but there were a couple of them in the room... And they spoke of how the program had helped them come to grips with the problem, that they were no longer so alone.  \n  \n\nEarly on in my speaking I said that as a part of the problem \u201cmy middle name is DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO\u201d  That resonated,  These people knew that one.   \n  \n\nIn many ways I said, **recovery is learning how to become teachable. Simply learning how to listen.**  \n    \n  ",

I can't even remember the last time i went trough a single weekend in my life without drinking (probably until 18yo).\n\nNow, i don't drink myself to blackout, but i sure feel the need to get that light buzz, otherwise, it just seems that i didn't rest during my weekend. \n\nHowever, i did have 2 experiences that make me ashamed, where i got drunk, vomitted, blacked out and got bathed by my fiancee. Did not had amnsesia, but lost control and vomitted all around the bathroom, so she needed to clean all the mess, bath me and put me in bed. She cryed alot, and suffered alot, because her deceased father used to be an tragic alcoholic, and i made her remember all the stress and struggle she experiencied with him. She almost broke up with me, and i felt terrible, because i remember how much she suffered from dealing with her alcoholic father. \n\nFirst time (2015), i promised her it would be the last. Then it happened a second time (2016), wich i promised it would be defenitely the last, and didn't blacked out since then.\n\nDuring those both occurrences, i was with friends, that instigated me altough i didn't see the black out coming. I always tought to be in control.\n\nOtherwise than that, i still drink (mostly beer, rarely vodka, rum, whiskey, but just a dose). My crack is for beer. I'm the beer guy, that praises a long neck.\n\nRecently, i'm getting more worried about that. In fact, i recently started to break, once in a while, the \"not drinking during the week\" rule. Sometimes, in the supermarket, i grab a can, have a sip while buying stuff. And that does not stopped me from drinking during the same weekend, also. \n\nAnd what scares me the most is that i have been making self-promises of not drinking during the weekend, and faillling miserably. I always end up having my 6~12 cans weekend experience, giving up from my promise, telling to myself that it's no problem, for i'm not binge drinking, for the fact that i've been productive during the week, and that things will never be out of control, because most of adult man have this habit without turning into an alcoholic.\n\nBut the thing is. I WANT to get rid of it, and i'm failling. So that's scary for me. Some people say that i should not worry, that it's just the regular social drinking. Some people say that i should worry, because if i want to stop, and fail everytime, than it's already an addiction.\n\nI know that most of you guys have way more experience in that path than those people, and way more experience than me.\n\nSo, could someone please give me some ideas? Should i look for medical help right now? Should i try to quit by myself, and COMMIT with it once and for all? Am i already an alcoholic?\n\nPlease help me, that question is just bothering me for the last days, and it's making me so nervous. I don't want to loose control, and i fear that if i continue on this path, things maybe would get serious after some years. Am i just being paranoid, os does my fears make sense?\n\nThank you all for reading the long text, and i'm sorry for the english mistakes. I wish you all an amazing day, and best of happines on your way to sobriety.\n",

   "selftext": "Some background:\n\n* Almost 40yo Male\n* never have been smoker\n* drink regularly (mostly vodka and club soda for low calories)\n* ~208 Lbs (~94.3 KG)\n* previously diagnosed with Ciguatera poisoning about 6-7 years ago (grouper tacos)\n\nSo I was about 245 Lbs (111 KG) in late January when I got the nasty flu going around and didn't eat much for about 7 days, was doing nothing but drinking gatorade and water and acetaminophen to control fever. I lost 10 lbs as a result of the illness and this motivated to continue to loose weight and diet to be healthier. I was already having pains in my knees and joints sometimes which are now gone since I weigh less.\n\n\nAbout 10 days ago we were do to have dinner for Mothers day. Carb heavy and yummy. Unfortunately dinner was delayed and I had not eaten anything all day. About 2 hours before a dinner (note it was delayed about 1.5 hours) I was not feeling so great, had diarrhea, little dehydrated, (don't remember what I ate night before) and started to get anxiety about the pins and needles feeling that were coming and going in my hands and feet. Not sure if caused by anxiety but then I started having heart palpitations which caused even more anxiety. I finally ate my usual non american sized portion of food (I'm dieting remember) and felt a little better, and drank 2 bottles of water but the feelings didn't completely go away.\n\nWe then had to visit Mom #2 and I started to think, oh know, I've finally done it, I've gone too far and I'm having some kind of alcohol withdrawal (note that I have never had any withdrawal before) and I said to myself, I need a damn drink to calm the nerves.  I had 3 scotches and water (she didn't have vodka) and all was good with the world. All symptoms gone.\n\n\nThe next day I remembered that I have had these tingly pins and needles sensations 6-7 years ago for months from when me and my SO ate contaminated grouper. Ciguatera or something similar was the diagnosis. We both had very bad symptoms, especially the anxiety and the pins and needles. I haven't had much of any of these symptoms reoccur in years but my SO has every once in a while when she eats something that triggers. it.\n\nFast forward to 7 days after Mother's day and after some 2 days of very light meals and heavy drinking (went to a casino with a friend but was also trying to get down to 200 Lbs this past week to celebrate my diet) I now have this parasthesia (the tingly feeling) that comes and goes.\n\nNotes on my diet since flu: light on carbs, reasonably sized portions, usually one meal a day, dinner but I snack lightly during the day.\n\nI plan to get tests done to rule things about but wanted to ask here while I wait for my appointment:\n\n* Can lipid soluble neruotoxins (ciguatoxin) be released, years later when someone is dieting?\n* If yes, why symptoms only now?\n* When I had the flu I stopped drinking completely obviously and didn't have any alcohol symptoms so I don't think I drink enough for that. I drink the same amount now as pre flu, other than cutting out beer during the week because I'm trying to limit my carbs but could that change have some effect?\n* A friend of mine said diabetes (thanks for giving me more anxiety friend) but why would I have high blood sugar if I had been fasting for almost 24 hours? \n\n\nAny questions feel free to ask. This is just a curiosity to me and I'm hoping I shouldn't be worried or if there is anything I should try.",

   "selftext": "I'm giving myself ten minutes to type.\n\nSo, I'm 21 and built up quite a few bad habits when I first got introduced to alcohol. I haven't given up on \"maybe I can moderate,\" but even if I can, you need to stay sober for at least 30 days before thinking about moderation.\n\nThis was SUPPOSED to be Sober May. I made it over a week at the beginning for the first time since I was too young to legally drink. Then I fell off the wagon, and I fell off HARD. 10 drinks that first night. The next day 1, and the next day 2, and the next day nothing, but last night I killed off a bottle of wine. I kill off bottles of wine when I think 1 or 2 glasses will do the trick. So I definitely need some more time to kill off the bad habit, at least.\n\nThat's not the only thing wrong with me. Since a very young age, I've had a problem with mindless internetting. Random Google searches, staying up all night to watch The Simpsons...my school handed out laptops to everybody in ninth grade. Worst. Thing. Ever for me. I never paid attention in class. My internet problem took a lot from my adolescence. I have some good memories from that time, but I was just on the internet too damn much. Didn't practice music. Didn't draw. Didn't shop for clothes. I don't want to end up the same way in my 20's. Every problem my ADHD gives me, random internetting makes it worse (I'm on Strattera.) Probably alcohol, too.\n\nSo what does this have to do with my drinking problem? Avoidance, mainly.  I've always been an avoider of problems when I The nice thing about random internetting is that it makes you feel nothing. Then again, the sucky thing about random internetting is that it makes you feel nothing AND it's a huge time waster. I lose big blocks of time when I could be exercising, reading, drawing, making money, writing, cleaning, laundry, Netflixing, playing video games. Yeah, that's how bad it's gotten. I can't even watch Netflix or play video games, i.e. things that are ACTUALLY fun on screens.\n\nIt's to avoid things. I told my mom and my addiction counselor yesterday that they were lucky to be born in a time before me, before you could just turn on a screen and distract yourself from feeling sad, bored, anxious, etc. Sure, there were televisions, but you couldn't exactly pull out your television on the bus when you were feeling down.\n\nWhen I first quit earlier this month, I did nothing but Reddit and eat junk food. I guess it was a way to avoid things, because I couldn't numb myself at night with alcohol. But what's the point if your life just becomes internet? This time, I want to actually look forward to quitting. Even if I can moderate, I need to put that on the back burner for now while I try to quit the internet.\n\nSo I've been going through a tense time at home. And it's easy to distract yourself with the internet. Tense time with my parents. Tense time with money. Tense time with school. Last night, all I wanted was my sketchbook, cocktail music, and a glass of wine (I know, I know.) Alone time, basically. But I couldn't get it, because then I got an angry text from my boyfriend, who was pissed at me for rapidly changing and finally cancelling plans last night. On my end, this had something to do with the said tense time with my parents. So that's another thing to deal with when I just wanted alone time. \n\nSo I grab my keys and go downstairs in tears, ready to drive to deal with my bf. My dad sees me. \"What's wrong? Where are you going?\" Great. Now he's dragged into this too and won't want me driving while it's rainy and I'm upset. I came very close to snapping at him. But instead...I just sat at the kitchen table and *cried.* Head-in-arms cry. Daddy came and rubbed my back, just like you would with a bay. I cried and cried and cried, and a few minutes later, I was out to see the boyfriend. Dad recommended against it, but it didn't turn into a *thing,* thank god.\n\nSo I got in my car and drove away. \n\nAnd\n\nI\n\nSCREAMED.\n\nIt was one of those ear-piercing toddler screams, the kind that starts in the pit of your stomach and rises up your back. A scream in which you don't realize you're screaming until halfway through. It was all the stress. The tension. And all I'd wanted was some alone time to get away from it all.\n\nAnyway, I went to the bf's and talked things out with him. Basically:\n\n* I was sorry the plans last night were a random jumble, and if I were him I'd be mad too\n\n* I was going through a lot at home.\n\nAnd I cried. Ugly sobs. And I pressed up against him and got his chest wet with tears and snot. But we talked it out.\n\nAnd at the end?\n\nI felt shaky, worn out, sad, tired, but...better. I was feeling. Feelings not numbed by internet or alcohol. That's what I'm missing out on. Feeling. Feeling is living. Boredom, frustration, sadness, feeling upset, that's all part of living. It's like when you can't draw a lion without a reference, and every night when you do it, you flip through your sketchbook and think, \"I suck at this - I suck at this - I suck at this.\" And every night you want to walk away from the drawing.\n\nBut then sometimes you flip to a lion. \"Holy CRAP, did I draw that?\"\n\nAnd the frustration makes it all worth it.\n\nIt's so easy to turn to a bottle or the internet when you feel frustrated or upset. But avoidance just makes problems bigger. Getting up from drawing a lion does not make a complete lion drawing.\n\nI told my therapist that logically, I know what I need to do to accomplish things. But knowing what you need to do and doing it are two different things. I'm the queen of avoidance, remember? He suggested making a schedule. Just for today. And I did. I woke up with trouble sticking to it (remember that wine? Stayed up late drinking it.) But I went out and exercised anyway. I've still found myself reaching for Reddit, and it's not perfect. But it's a wall. Maybe today I can lay down one little brick. And maybe another tomorrow. And one day I'll be the person that consistently exercises. Consistently draws. Actually finishes things she starts. But today, I have a schedule. And I'll do what I can to stick to it. I need to actually feel and live life.\n\nI allotted myself an hour of screen time now, and I've spent forty minutes typing this out while my 3DS continues to collect dust. So, I'll see you guys later. IWNDWYT ",

The last couple of months I've started to think I may have a problem with alcohol and would appreciate some input.\n\nTo begin, I rarely crave alcohol. I can go weeks without a drop and it doesn't bother me. I am fine going for a couple of drinks; a pint or two at the pub and I'm ok. I've even been on boozy dates where I've had a maybe 3/4 and I can handle that fine.\n\nThe problem seems to be when I go on a 'proper' night out, i.e. when I go out with intention of bar-hopping / clubbing. 5 pints seems to be the point of no return; after that I just want to drink and drink and drink. I start to feel the buzz and want more and more. This has, unfortunately, led to many hazy nights and often black outs over the years. \n\nI resent the embarrassment the following morning when a friend says to me \"Do you remember doing X last night?!\" Nope, can't say I do! I've thankfully (not yet) done anything completely outrageous or lost friends as a result of my drinking, but I have been obnoxious in the past. This has resulted in me being thrown out of bars/clubs on a few occasions.\n\nI enjoy drinking, and I like the feeling of being drunk (but not black out drunk!) and don't want to cut alcohol out of my life. However, I have two questions to ask:\n\n1. Based on what I have said, do you think I have some sort of problem with alcohol?\n\n2. Is there anything I can do to stop myself from buying \"just one more drink\"?\n\nSorry for my rambling. I appreciate any advice / thoughts you can share with me. :) ",

I\u2019ve been to a few social functions/bbqs/dinners etc and am happy with soft drinks, mocktails or alcohol free cider/beer. \n\nThe thing I am most proud of is that my daughter hasn\u2019t seen me with an alcoholic drink in all this time! \n\nGood luck to you all, the passing of time makes it so much easier! Once I got to six weeks, eight weeks etc all the cravings seemed to disappear. \n\nHere\u2019s to another 128 days!! ",

   "selftext": "So the reason I'm writing this is because I'm sick of my parents fighting about this subject. Growing up, I have rarely seen them argue and shout for any other reason besides this one. They are still currently married and have had a happy marriage overall. They\u2019re currently both in their 50s and I\u2019m in my 20s. We are ethnically Chinese but are Canadian citizens.\n\nNow with some of the background out of the way, let me tell you what the problem is: my father\u2019s mother, my grandmother. I\u2019m going to tell you the stories as I have heard them, from both my father\u2019s and my mother\u2019s side, about what happened between them and my grandmother.\n\nTo start off, my father tells of what kind of a mother my grandmother is. My dad is the younger of two brothers. He told me he always felt like the lesser child. For instance, when his mother would call them home for dinner while they were outside, she would always call out my uncle\u2019s name, never my dad\u2019s. One time during grade school, my dad brought a friend home for dinner. Instead of welcoming and showing hospitality to this friend, she berated my father for it, in front of said friend. This happened another time when my dad was in university so after that he learned not to bring any more friends home.\n\nSoon after, my dad met my mom at work and became friends. They worked in a different city from where my dad\u2019s parents lived. At some point, my mother needed to go to my dad\u2019s hometown for work and my dad decided to tag along to visit home. On the day of arrival, my dad told my grandmother about my mom and my mom was invited to a dinner at my dad\u2019s house. It was unplanned, so my mom felt uncomfortable showing up empty handed so she declined. Also, because they weren\u2019t exactly dating. However, it appears this action left my grandmother a bad impression because she, again, berated my father for this. Now when I say berating, I mean this lady swore like a sailor, calling my mother any female derogatory term you can think of. You also must understand that in those days, people don\u2019t even swear at strangers like that. So that night, my father refused to return home and spent the night at an overnight cinema.\n\nWhen eventually they did start dating for obvious reasons, but also because my mom was a bit stubborn and felt that she wants to get to know my dad simply because his mother disapproved of her. My dad was also stubborn in the same way for the same reason. Another reason was when my mom brought my dad home to meet her parents, they liked my dad and felt he was an honest and caring man who is fit to be a husband (which turned out to be quite true). My mom eventually did meet my dad\u2019s parents, but they said every single time the four of them were together was unpleasant, consisting of my grandmother berating my dad and my mom. One time, my parents were at my dad\u2019s house for a visit, and my grandmother came home from work. She had to commute while there was a sandstorm outside so that must\u2019ve ticked her off because when she got home and saw my parents there, notably my mom, my grandmother threw a tantrum and proceeded to smash a glass jar and screamed some more. Again, shouting the foulest names and obscenities at the both of them.\n\nGenerally, my parents tried to avoid them since every encounter was a nightmare. However, they wanted to get married. So as per tradition, it was time my dad\u2019s parents and my mom\u2019s parents to meet each other. My mother\u2019s parents showed up with gifts as expected to show good tidings, but my dad\u2019s parents did not bring anything, effectively saying they would not approve of the marriage. Nevertheless, due to love and stubbornness, my parents decided to get married. Since my dad\u2019s parents did not approve, they refused to pay for the wedding as was custom. A wedding did take place, however, because a mutual friend of my parents was well off and knew of their situation. He felt sorry for my parents and paid for a small wedding where my parents and their friends held a gathering.\n\nAt this point, my parents are married, and they\u2019ve limited their contact with my dad\u2019s parents because every meeting ended my grandmother shouting at them and kicking them out of her apartment. Another time, my dad went to visit home and had bought a big watermelon and as soon as he step through the door, the berating began again. He told me had none of it and angrily threw the watermelon out of an apartment window and stayed elsewhere.\n\nAround this time, they were dirt poor and had lived in a shack/hut in some village. Somehow my grandmother found out where they lived and one morning at 5am, she took some glass bottles nearby and proceeded to smash about a dozen of them one after another against their door while berating them and shouting profanities. I think it was around this time they decided to go pretty much no contact with her.\n\nOne time my grandmother apparent went to my mom\u2019s workplace and chatted up all the old ladies there spreading rumors of how my mom got pregnant out of wedlock and such.\n\nEventually my parents both got great jobs and moved across the country to the south. Then came the decision to move to Canada. They had no idea what they were getting as it was before the internet and information was limited. They decided to leave their good jobs behind and move to a new land to give me a better life, but also to get far away from my dad\u2019s parents. Since they were my dad\u2019s parents after all, he decided to bring us to visit before we left. At the time was around 10 and didn\u2019t know about any of this stuff so it felt pretty normal, beside the fact that my mother basically put on her best behaviour in fear of doing anything that will give my grandmother ammunition to begin her berating again. Soon after, we got on a plane to Canada to begin our new life.\n\nLike most immigrants, my parents worked hard to provide. After a few years, we were pretty well off ourselves, typical middle-class lifestyle. They had bought a house and because of their new found religion, they decided to forgive all the shit my grandmother did and bring my dad\u2019s parents over to Canada to visit for a few months. That, of course, didn\u2019t end well. I around 13 and I still didn\u2019t know much about this history but I remember shouting, my mom crying, my dad being angry at my grandma and maybe at my mother a bit too. According to my mom, my grandmother is just being the manipulative person that she is, which now that I have met her few times, I can tell you she\u2019s not a good human being. I remember one time she mouthed me off about my mother. She would say things to hurt my mom when my dad wasn\u2019t around. During these few months, I think my mom got into an argument with my dad because of this and she ran and slept at a neighbour\u2019s house. Things settled down the next day and my dad went to get her. Upon returning, my grandmother loudly pronounced \u201cAH, MY SON IS HOME SAFE AND SOUND\u201d, obviously a big fuck you to my mom.\n\nI think it was around the time after they left that my dad had a change of heart and decided it wasn\u2019t worth fighting his parents anymore, but my mother, who was obviously much more hurt by all that\u2019s happened, realized she cannot forgive my grandmother, simply because she hasn\u2019t changed. A few years later, my grandfather told my mom that while they visited my parents in Canada, they were still actively trying to start shit and breaking them apart. I hadn\u2019t mentioned my grandpa much in this post because he didn\u2019t have much of a hand in all the shit my grandmother did, but he didn\u2019t keep her in check either because he\u2019s pretty spineless.\n\nA few years after their visit, my parents went back to China for a visit and a vacation, however, due to my dad\u2019s new attitude, he has turned the tables and stopped fighting his mother as much and instead turned his frustrations to my mother. When they went back, they had 3 luggage bags, one for each of their clothes and another for gifts to bring to their family and friends. My grandmother took that extra luggage my mother had as an excuse to start shit again. Saying she should have gotten more money from her son as a gift. Due to this, my mother and father had a huge argument because my mother refused to give more. It was also on this trip that my grandmother presented my mother with HER OWN BELT that my grandmother had taken from our house while visiting us in Canada. She took it without permission and said it didn\u2019t fit her well so she\u2019s giving it to my mom. Anyways, just all around manipulating and saying things to my mom while my dad isn\u2019t around. My other uncle was going to drive my parents and I around the province for a road trip but my grandmother threw a big enough fit to make my dad stay with her for the week.\n\nThere\u2019s not much more worth writing about the history, simply because it was just repeating the same shit over and over again. Too many times to remember. But the reason I\u2019m writing all this is because my parents are now fighting whenever the topic of my grandmother comes up. My mother has not forgiven my grandmother and at the suggestion of a psychiatrist, is avoiding her at all costs. She basically has PTSD from all her experiences, especially from being startled awake by the sound of glass bottles smashing her front door. Now mentions of my grandmother triggers her and she begins to break down and cry so she refuses to do anything for them. My dad, either doesn\u2019t seem to understand how traumatizing all this stuff was for her or doesn\u2019t care anymore. He continues to keep some contact with his parents and feels he has a duty as a son to take care of his parents. This is understandable because, after all, she is his mother and he says she still did a lot for him despite all the horrible things she's done. My mom is extremely hurt because she feels when he\u2019s doing things for his parents, such as allowing them to stay at our house for their potential trip through North America, he\u2019s not respecting her feelings and all the pain they went through together. My dad says he just wants to keep the peace and will time my mom\u2019s visit to China such that my mom and grandmother wouldn\u2019t be under the same roof at the same time. My thoughts are that I can tell my grandmother is narcissistic, manipulative person. I understand PTSD and trauma is a thing and my mom has lots of trouble controlling her emotions on this subject, but during arguments, she can\u2019t communicate properly which escalates the situation a lot. My father, I think, understands her pain to an extent but I think he just feels that duty to be a good son (even though I think based on what his parents did, they don\u2019t even deserve his respect). Still, I feel like he has grown a bit numb and insensitive to her crying so he will do things for his parents despite my mom\u2019s refusal and plead.\n\nTLDR: Grandma is a pretty terrible human being and did nothing but berate my parents for wanting to be together. Also actively did things to sabotage their relationship such as smashing things and spreading rumors, which caused my mother a lot of trauma. PTSD even perhaps. Dad forgave his mom now but mom hasn't and this causes issues because mom thinks dad no longer cares about the pain they shared. I do, however, urge you to read the whole thing to get a clearer view.\n\nSo I make this thread so they may hear your thoughts. Should my dad just cut all ties with his parents for the things they\u2019ve done? Should my mom just wait it out until they die in the next few years? Is my dad unjustly insensitive towards my mom on this subject?",

   "selftext": "I had the most amazing weekend, well Thursday-Tuesday, in Colorado visiting old friends from college. I graduated in 2016, and left not too long after to seek employment in a cheaper city, something I regret every day. I love Colorado and I'm actively working on getting back. Anyway, this is a big time beer town, everyone drinks, and most people drink a lot. I made plans with friends months ago to come out for one of their 27th birthdays. We planned to camp out and see a show at a venue up in the mountains, one of my favorite concert venues in the world actually. So obviously I was stoked. But like I said, I made the plans months ago, when I was still in full on drink-mode, and made the plans fully intending on getting royally plastered basically the entire time I was there. Well, 40something days ago, I had had enough of my own bullshit and decided to make a major change, and quit drinking. I debated telling my friends, but I didn't want them to adjust their plan or their expectation of the weekend because of me, so I held off, especially because I had tried before to get sober but never made it much past the first week or so. I knew they would be supportive of whatever I chose, but I didn't want to say something if I wasn't sure about it. Around day 30 I decided it was dumb not to say something, so in conversation about our plans for the weekend I causally dropped in that I was actually about a month sober so I wouldn't be drinking, but didn't want that to change whatever plans we had, except I might skip the brewery tour and probably wouldn't be bar hopping. As I figured everyone was super cool about it, but I knew the real test was still coming. We had planned to camp out Thursday-Saturday night, with the show late Saturday, so Friday and Saturday would be the rager nights with lots of friends coming up for the show. Thursday was chill, it was just 5 of us up at the site, we were smoking and all of us ate a little bit of psilocybin chocolates. They were drinking, but not really to excess, as we were all pretty high from the chocolates. I went to bed around 2am, but instead of going to sleep, as I was still very much tripping, I had a very deep, emotional 'conversation' with myself, about my life, what I was doing, where I was and where I wanted to be, and how I could get there. It was very therapeutic for me to finally think though some of the things that have been stuck in my mind that I was too afraid to address. I eventually fell asleep and woke up feeling fantastic. This was the first 'sober' night of camping I've had since I was kid. Normally I start drinking before I even get to the campsite. I'll have a couple road beers, crack a fresh one the second I get the cooler out, with whiskey pulls spaced throughout to keep the buzz ever rising. That was what everyone's Friday plan seemed to be. The guys I was with were up late, even though they hadn't drank all that much. But the first thing each of them did was crack a beer (~10am). I am all too familiar with this camping phenomenon that means drinking beer before 10am is no longer frowned upon. I was definitely a breakfast beer guy. I was able to convince them to go hike after about 12, but not without a couple beers in the backpack along with a water bottle someone filled with whiskey. This whole time I'm thinking \"thank god I'm not drinking, because I'd be hammered already and it's not even noon\". I honestly didn't feel an urge to drink once my entire trip. After our hike, we went back to the campsite and just hung out and smoked, everyone around getting steadily more drunk as the day went on, passing bottles of whiskey and tequila around (a couple more people showed up while we were hiking, toting even more booze of all variety), while making quick work of the multiple cases of Budweiser and Bud Light everyone brought. At this point I'm loving how clear headed I am, I am talking to people I haven't seen in years, who have only know me as the drunk guy, who are so genuinely happy that I'm sober, and I'm just further cementing this dry mindset. The night pretty much just goes like that, with people slowly getting more and more fucked up, while I smoke a bit here and there and sip on my peach-pear LaCroix. I was talking with this girl a lot through the night, but it got to a point where she was so intoxicated I couldn't talk to her, and she eventually barfed in her tent, while I slept cozily in my hammock sober and un-vomited-on. This is getting really long, but I'll wrap this up with the concert on Saturday. It was a lot of fun, but it was also pretty maddening at the same time. The show was great, but it was freezing cold and snowing a little bit, so less than ideal concert conditions. What was annoying, and something I obviously never realized before because I was always hammered, was just how little spatial awareness drunk people have. I was constantly getting elbowed, shoved, bumped, toes stepped on, drinks spilled, when I was barely even moving. I had to go to the back of the venue where I could have a bit of space. Which actually ended up being pretty cool because I started talking to this random chick, which is something I would never do drunk. Nothing happened, we just talked a bit, but usually I'm too in my head and worried about saying stupid shit because I'm so drunk to even approach or start a conversation with a random pretty girl like that, so it felt like a good 'out of my shell' moment. This is a wall of text I'm sorry, I just wanted to share the story of my amazing weekend with my amazing friends, that I stayed fully sober for. And I'm damn proud about it.",

   "selftext": "Sorry this is so long. I can't talk to anyone about this, just needed to get it out.\n\nMy [~21yo] brother is addicted to alcohol and weed--not bud, either, but concentrates. When I visited this Christmas, I couldn't help myself and ended up looking through his room. I didn't have to look hard. I found about a dozen empty vodka handles casually stuffed under his bed and an open one on his nightstand. He is open about the weed use, even with my parents (who he lives with), and it's easy for him to get his hands on dabs since he's of age in CO. It was at this moment I realized how bad things had gotten. I chatted with him about it later that night and asked where he thought this path would lead him. He said, \"I know, I know... Alcoholism.\" But things have only gotten worse.\n\nSeveral times he's called me saying he drank too much and needs tips for sobering up before work. He drives for a living. Every single time he does this I tell him to CALL OUT, DO NOT DRIVE, but he makes some excuse about why he can't and inevitably goes in.\n\nAbout 8 weeks ago, my parents threw him out of the house. When my mom called him to ask where he would be sleeping, he said he didn't know, that he had just walked down to the local pub where he was spending his last $11. He had no plan. Later that night, he ended up breaking into her (unlocked) car in the driveway. He slept there for three nights before apologizing to my parents and promising to do better. He still hasn't told me about this--my mom did.\n\nIn the last 18mos, he has totaled 3 cars (admittedly one of those times was not his fault). The last one was particularly bad--he broke his hand and the doctor told him there could be permanent damage. Just this week his insurance company fired him as a client, and he can't afford the insane insurance rates at other places with his minimum wage job. And that means he's losing said job, as he works as a delivery driver. It might sound silly, but that job is his whole life right now. His entire social network. All of his friends. He's losing all of his friends. He's completely crushed.\n\nHe has no self esteem, at all. He's never been in a relationship. He tried college for a year, but my parents pulled him out due to bad grades/poor attendance. He sees no paths forward and often says things like I'll never have a good job, a wife, children, etc. \nIt doesn't help that my life is going pretty well, at least on the surface--I'm about halfway through my doctorate, in a six year relationship, should be starting the dissertation this time next year. He constantly refers to me as the Golden Child and himself as the family's black sheep. He doesn't believe me when I tell him exactly how difficult my life can be, will continue to be. He doesn't believe me when I tell him how much therapy/anti-depressants have helped me. He has labeled himself a failure.\n\nToday, when I tried to call him (three times) just to help/listen/provide support, he dodged every call. We haven't spoken in two weeks. When I called my mom to make sure things were okay, she told me he doesn't want to talk to me. He's shutting me out. I guess I understand on some level, but fuck, it hurts.\n\nMy brother is sweet and funny and honestly pretty good looking. He wanted to be a counselor and would be great at it. I'm so worried he's going to drive drunk and kill himself or someone else. I'm so worried he's going to commit suicide. \n\nWhat's more, my parents' marriage is beginning to fail. All they do is think about him and talk about him, and it's like a poison. They've been sleeping in separate rooms for 8 months.\n\nI love him so much, but our family is imploding over this and it's killing me. Thanks for reading.",

Alcohol was an essential part of nearly my entire life. \nTowards the end I was getting miserable. I calculated I would have 30 minutes of intense euphoria, then about 12 hours of misery. I enjoyed that 30 minutes a day so much that this cycle was repeated over and over. I hid my drinking from my family.

I was so plastered that I was staggering around and could barely speak. My teenage children had to prop me up in the chair. I was so embarrassed that I admitted everything.\nThe next day I went cold turkey.\nI made it. I cannot believe I have done it. My only support is this group. I have very few close friends, and certainly no one to talk to about my addiction. There is also a fear of an impact on my job. If I have documented alcoholism, I jeopardize my professional license.  For the first few days I immersed myself in reading books about addiction. My favorites were \"A drinking life\" and \"Basketball diaries\"\nMy cravings are still there, especially when I drive home after work. \nI am being policed by my own virtue. I constantly say to myself \"I don't drink.\"\nMy wife thinks I am still drinking. Of course I was drinking exclusively vodka to avoid getting busted. She comes up to me and smells me every few minutes. This has become so annoying I am tempted to stop wearing deodorant.\nI think I have this beat. Even if I am permanently sober, I plan on checking in to this group forever.\nThanks everyone, and good luck to you\n",

   "selftext": "I kind of use it as a coping mechanism. I drink a lot of nights. I don't get hammered or blacked out drunk or anything, I just drink until I don't feel like it anymore, which is usually around 5 drinks depending on the night I guess. The thing about my drinking, is, I know it's wrong, and my closest friends don't like it, but they won't ever speak up about it. But what they don't know is why I drink. I use it to stop feeling the way I do when I'm sober at night. I've been sober the last three nights, and it was the worst three night stretch I've had in a long time. I was extremely suicidal last night; I went for a drive, because that usually calms me down but it didn't feel right, and I started to have think about driving as fast as I could into a tree or something. So I turned back and went home. I tried to talk to my friend about it, the only friend who knows I'm suicidal, but that didn't go so well. Now we're not on great terms, once again. She hates that I drink for the reasons I do, but she won't ever help me even though I've asked numerous times. I know it's a bad habit and I've tried quitting once before, but I barely lasted one night. These last few nights (where I was just too lazy to go buy more alcohol) have made me scared to quit drinking because I know what'll happen if I do without a reliable alternate coping method. There are people I want to talk to, a couple I consider close friends, some not as much, but I like them a lot and trust them. I just don't feel like it would be right. To talk about my alcohol use would mean bringing up my suicidal past and tendencies, things I've only ever talked about with one friend, who I trust more than anyone. I'm also not in great contact with these people. We're all apart since university is done for the summer, so it's not easy. I don't know what I expect from this post, but maybe I'll feel better getting some of these things off my chest to someone other than my unhelpful friend.",

   "selftext": "My girlfriend and I have been dating a few years now and she recently moved in with me to my apartment. She had been going through a rough patch, high anxiety and depression problems which she has been struggling with (on and off) for as long as I've known her. This caused her to recently lose her job and her apartment. \n\nI reluctantly agreed to let her move into my place, after she was adamant her unemployment was temporary and she'd be back on her feet in a month or two and was confident she'd be able to contribute, financially. Basically, this was her only option besides either moving into a group home or move three states away to her alcoholic mother's house. I didn't like the idea, but finally caved. \n\nSo, a month goes by and she does start working a (very) part time job. But she is still struggling and tells me one evening she thinks she needs to go on disability and can't work (for the foreseeable future). I didn't take much stock into it, she's talked about it before and things have kind of \"blown over\". I, stupidly, said I would be supportive as much as I could with her decision, not fully processing the situation. Literally, the next morning she quits her job and now with a month out of work the reality is starting to hit me.\n\nFor the past month I've been covering 95% of expenses. I make a decent living but it has been a financial burden. I'm still paying off my school debt and car loan, and now I feel like I'm supporting a child and it's really starting to drain my bank account but moreso, my soul. I come home from work and she is on the counch in her pajamas watching Fuller House and my once pristine apartment reeks of weed and kitty litter. I don't know how much more I can take without snapping. I also feel like my trust was breached and am feeling more than a bit used.\n\nIt's very likely that she will get disability given her mental history, but that is at least a year out and honestly, I don't think I can deal with this for a year, mentally or financially. Also, I'm nearing my 30s and I really wanted to start saving for a house and more aggressively pay down my bills, not support an adult. And once the disability comes through, we are looking at maybe $1000 a month for her to live off of, so basically I will always have to finance her lifestyle if I remain her partner. This has huge implications from everything to buying a house, to having children, etc.\n\nBasically, I feel guilty for having these feelings and I know a lot of this is my fault but I don't think I'm cut out to be with her if disability is the road she's going to go down. I don't think my life goals are compatible with that. Does this make me a bad person? How do I break it to someone who is already at their lowest point that I'm having these feelings and feel it's time for me to move on? How can I start putting my own needs in front of hers? I love her but I just cant do it any more, how do I dig myself out of this?",

I know that this was SUCH a horrible idea but I noticed my sunscreen had expired so I just didn't put any on as it didn't feel overly sunny or like I was being burned (complete mistake, I don't know how I could've been so stupid).

   "selftext": "So, I am in a streak right now, and  am feeling pretty good. I've been here before, and really 19-20 days isn't that big of a deal in terms of your mind or my mind for that matter. I've said it before and I'll say it again I've been dealing with porn and its power over me for over a decade and I'm 23. I am not one of these people who claim that not jerking off got me 20 big booty hos or that I suddenly gained 12 million friends and everyone wants me! What I am experiencing is rough, and anyone who says otherwise is a liar or should really consider whether or not they actually have a problem with porn.\n\nI don't say that to be disparaging, but sometimes you can be like an alcoholic and drink too much, or you can be a social drinker and only drink mildly. there's no shame in that. With me though, I lack impulse control with porn for sure. Recently I've begun a new routine to resist porn, and really it's based off of an old one. Workout at least four times a week for an hour, and it's tough for my low metabolic ass, but it's been helping me feel better I truly and honestly believe. Be it by endorphins or what have you not only do I notice this damnable gut of mine reducing but my overall happiness (though mildly) increasing. I have done this in the past but I always manage to fall out of it, but this time I'm honestly committed to it. I've cut back on junk food a crap ton, but do allow myself a cheat day to get those food cravings out of the way a week, and while I am also a soda addict I have mitigated this and added to my overall health by forcing myself to drink metric tons of water a day. Can this routine work for you? Maybe, but everyone is different.\nBesides the working out I will say again, proudly, I am a religious sort. I don't believe in forcing it onto others and I refuse to ever walk into a church to this day because of their BS. However, I have my own relationship with my higher power and I've taken to talking  to him twice a day. It helps me think through my problems and seek some guidance. Again, if you're not religious I get it, but maybe you should talk to either yourself more, or someone who can just listen rather than interfere in your own thought processes.\n\nNow, what about urges? Fucking unbelievable. Never for a moment believe you've washed yourself clean of porn, NEVER. Arrogance and pride are killers, you have to be humble and remember you've fucked up, but you can and want to try to do better. On a daily basis porn and sex are always on my mind, and I do my damndest to force them out, sometimes I can't. In those moments I have to breathe, and allow myself to feel what I'm feeling. Is there memory recall, yeah tons of it, but that's what happens when you're stressed out and your brain is trying to get you to calm down and deflate using methods you're used to. But allowing yourself to feel those feelings, and saying 'it's okay, but that's as far as it goes' has helped me work through those rough times.\n\nAgain, everyone is different so don't expect my routine to work for you and neither would I claim it to. I also must admit I did my best to stay away from NoFap. I have nothing against you guys, obviously since I'm posting, but sometimes I think this site is like Facebook or other social media. It can make us feel worse rather than better with the ridiculous expectations we build in our heads from seeing what others claim to be happening to them. I also didn't count how many days I have been clean. As when I put a number to it, it often makes me feel as though I need to strive towards an arbitrary goal that, once reached, leads me to arrogantly believe I don't need to try as hard. It's a daily thing, and it's a lifelong thing, at least for me.\n\nI probably won't be coming back to NoFap at least for a few weeks and try to not give a shit about counting days. I just want to be better, a better man, a better human being. healthier and happier, and I know porn will always be there, calling me. what's important is allowing myself to recognize that, and move on.\n\nI may fail, but that's a risk I and everyone else has to accept.\n\nI wish you all the best of luck.",

   "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nMy mom's been an alcoholic much longer than I've been alive, probably close to 40 years. She lost her job 6 months ago and the drinking has gotten worse now that she has nothing to do during the day. Worse is that her epilepsy, which is normally under control, is active and she's having seizures and hurting herself all the time.\n\nShe got sick last week and stopped eating and refused to get medical care because she doesn't have insurance. Finally I took her to her neurologist and he ordered that we go to the ER right away and that she stops drinking immediately. She's been in for two days with pneumonia and gallbladder issues. They're giving her meds for the detox right now.\n\nI had a long talk with her about drinking and how it's going to kill her if she doesn't stop. I feel like this is the last stop for her, and thankfully she's getting dry for a few days in a hospital, but I want her to stay dry when she gets out. I would like her to go to rehab but she has no insurance and no money and I can't pay for it. I'm just feeling at a loss right now trying to figure out what to do while also living my own life. I'm not at a point where I can take care of her or even take her in with me. Sorry for the long post but I had to get this out.",

I ended up bar-hopping and had way more than that, but I can't remember. \n\nAt a certain point I became belligerent and started kicking bikes over, punching lamps, yelling, swearing, not letting anyone get in my way. Got pushy with a guy after he told me they were closing and it very well could have ended in a brawl. \n\nEnded up calling my mom and spilled the beans. Told her I was sorry she had to put up with me, for ruining the rest of her day, and that there was something wrong with me. I thought of killing myself that night because I felt that I didn't have the strength to do this anymore. \n\nThankfully we have a good relationship; she simply told me to go home ASAP and sleep it off. However, she just had all her suspicions confirmed about me not being able to control my drinking. She now knows that her son is an alcoholic. She is supportive of me and willing to be an ear for me. \n\nUsually my relapses are spent alone in my apartment, but this time was different. I went totally crazy. I was an embarrassment to myself and the people around me and I was wrong. I was so wrong to have started drinking in the first place and wrong to let myself act in that way. If I affected you, I'm truly sorry. This is why I can't drink anymore.",

   "selftext": "Let me put some things in perspective. I have exactly 1 friend who's a girl, and the only reason we started talking was because I messaged her blackout drunk my first night drinking grain alcohol. What happened with her is an entire story for another post, but suffice to say alcohol was my crutch.\n\nBut then again it wasn't. I remember one night in my sophomore college dorm, I desperately was trying to work up the courage to talk to this different girl. I was already about 6 shots in, and I don't know about you but that would be enough for most normal people.\n\nBut it wasn't enough for me, so I drank some more. Still wasn't enough, still too scared. So then I drank some more. I think I finished the night on somewhere around 11 to 13 drinks, and it still wasn't enough. I learned that night that apparently being a coward is so ingrained in my personality that no amount of liquor would fix it.\n\nBut I still tried. Fast forward a year, and by that point I had, on separate occasions, stolen all of my one roommates beer one night, tried unsuccessfully to water down my other roommate's liquor so I could steal it, thrown up in the bathroom and had to replace everything in it, and endangered myself countless times. I tried to quit during my junior year, but a couple months later I found out that one of my roommates was having sex with that first girl I mentioned not 20 feet from my room. I started drinking again.\n\nGood news is I've been alcohol-free for over a year now, and I don't doubt for a second that it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.\n\nBad news is that I think alcohol has been a major factor in why I've been FA for the entirety of college. While everyone else was having fun and connecting with each other freshman year, I was too scared to do anything. While everyone else was having fun and connecting with each other sophomore year, I was drinking myself half to death while still being too scared to do anything. While everyone else was having fun and connecting with each other my last two years, I was instead focusing on alcohol recovery, all the while still too scared (and now too depressed!) to do anything.\n\nNow that college is over, I feel like I drank away all of my opportunities to become a normal person, and now I'm developmentally stunted with relationships and sex. I can't express interest in women sober, and because I was one step away from being an addict I never learned how. Now I'm behind and I hate it.\n\nOn a more superficial level, it now means that bars or any alcoholic occasion is right out as a way for me to meet people. The only thing worse than trying to socialize with a million drunk people is being the only sober person in the building while trying to socialize with a million drunk people.\n\nAs always, thanks for sticking with me if you read the whole thing. I really needed to get this stuff off my chest. &lt;3\n\n**TL;DR** I drank away my college years in an unsuccessful attempt to get more courage. I had to quit and now I feel like I am without my only social crutch.",

Two of these Roommates, we'll assign them as Roommate A and Roommate B. The other Roomate I have I have known for a year now and is one of my close friends. We'll call him Roommate C (more info below). \n\nFor almost a year now my roommates have been extremely loud, inviting friends over all\nhours of the day 4 days out of the week including weekdays. We all go to the same college and I have tried to get them to quiet all year long.\n\nTo give a bit of a backstory on myself I am\nquiet, have minimal friends over, and keep to myself. I am also a very clean and organized person, however the common room is always filled with beer bottles and marijuana bongs.

It is really starting to scare me that my personal record can be in jeopardy. \n\nCurrently roommates A and B have left for a few weeks to travel and while this has happened they have invited one of their personal friends to stay at the apartment and have a key while they are away. I have a huge problem with this person because he sleeps on the couch and invites multiple people over to smoke and drink every single night. They also crank up the volume of music annoying the fuck out of me and my girlfriend. \n\nRight now I am working on getting the police and notifying the apartment about these issues. \n\nThe reason why I am posting this is in regards to:\n\n1) a proper way to get the police involved to ensure that all parties are hopefully arrested and charged in court. I have never gone through this and I am not sure how to make sure I can get the police involved. I am thinking of the next time that the friend of roomate A and B's throws another party to call the cops over and see what they can do. I am wondering the best course of action. \n\n2) and this is a big one. Roomate C is one of my friends but he also smokes in the apartment and he is really close with my other roommates. I really don't want to bring him down but I am fearful that if I bring up what I am trying to do to my roommates/their friend, he will most likely tell them. \n\nSo, users of Reddit, what course of action should I take? \n\nTL;DR: My random roommates have irritated me enough with their unlawful activity that I am trying to get them arrested. I am worried about burning bridges with one of them because he is a close friend. \n\n",

My father is a alcoholic and he blames being in the military for that but I always knew there was something hidden in him that he has to drink so much. My father has never hit me but he has emotionally abused me. For instance one time he spit in my face and called me mean names. This has been going on for awhile and when I turned 18...some secrets came out. I first found out that my sister (who is adopted, but is truly my real sister) had been molested for about 10 years of her life from our dad.  She's my oldest sister and I hurt because she had to keep this hidden. She's already 25 and she told my other sister who is 23. We told our mom right away even though she didn't want us too. She didn't believe it but one day my dad was drunk and he admired it. He said something stupid like \"that wasn't as bad as what they did to me\"....he was crying. Then he admitted that his brothers raped him....this is a lot of stuff to hear. I need help because I don't know what to do about this information. I know there are a lot of people out there that go through this and don't become alcoholics.  My parents already got a divorce and so far he looks like he's changed but this has really affect me. Should I forgive my father for most of my life being in a asshole and all the emotional abuse he has put me through because there was a factor that led him to do that Or should I stay away from him and just forget that he's my father. The father that put me through a lot of shit. There's a lot more stories like him putting a gun to my head when I was 1 years old and him doing coke.  I'm just rambling because there's a lot in my head but I just need advice. ",

My partner's wife is back in the hospital, and he was tired from long drives in the opposite direction, so I drove again and we discussed how demanding his wife had become. He's going through a lot and the thought of a drink is not coming anywhere near.\n\nOnce inside, the process for which went very smoothly, with our \"get out of jail free\" cards in our pockets, the alternate universe took hold pretty quickly.  Early on the leader asks if there are any 'burning desires', any shit that needs be dumped. And a man spoke up.  It seems that a lot of the older correction officers are retiring and they are being replaced by much younger ones, some of whom have a drive to make a name for themselves by writing 'tickets' for infractions which are non existent or very rarely enforced.  One, another, and still another man shared of this, and then a lifer, spoke \\-*\"*let's be real here, let's tell the whole story, I am the reason I am here in prison.  It all comes back to me.\" *** *****\n\npreachybit/I am most grateful I did not have a felony in the wreckage  I had to clean up when I got sober, *but the applause I got in the AA rooms for however many days sober did not carry out of the meeting room to my bosses office, to my house where my wife had boxes of resentments.*  I did not want to admit it then, but I was the reason I was not being considered for promotion, I was the reason my wife did not trust me, **I was the reason I did not like myself.**.. and it was not easy to admit./preachybit\n\nIt was also pointed out that these new correction officers fell squarely into the category of things \"we can not change.\"  Eventually they will learn the balance that exists in prison, how mutual respect works a lot better than throwing your weight around trying to establish fear. Until then keep your head down.\n\npreachybit2/ AA is not called \"Attitude Adjustment\" for nothing.  Sometimes the things we hear in meetings are not things we want to hear.  Yeah these guys had to get it off their chests, but they also had to make sure they weren't still carrying a chip on their shoulders.  As an alcoholic I was good at pointing at others, blaming, but as they say \"When you point, three fingers are pointing back at you.\"/preachybit2\n\nThis lead to another man talking about how great it is that in AA we can talk about this stuff. How we can help each other see the truth... \\- the meeting progressed; we read from one of the books, we shared, we came together and in some way each of us grew, if only a little, one realization at a time.\n\nSo if someone asks \"You still go to meetings?\" I answer,\"yes and I still get a lot out of them\".",

Then, I met my now (ex) fiance, who was a great guy in some ways...but encouraged a lot of really unhealthy habits in me. He kept telling me I didn't really have a problem, that I deserved to \"have fun\" etc. (eyeroll).  \n\nWell you know how the story goes from this point. Overdrinking, shame, feeling like total crap. Never just one drink...never.\n\nNow, I've finally called off the wedding...and I'm so done feeling this way! I want to get back to where I was living a sober, healthy and thriving life. A few things I need to remind myself of:\n\n1) I DO have a problem with alcohol. I always will- and I AM an alcoholic\n2) I never have just one drink\n3) I DO deserve to have fun- and to live a life free of alcohol to do it!\n4) One day at a time...\n\nAnyways, I'm wondering if anyone has any tips for dealing with cravings. I find the first day is usually ok (generally because I still feel guilty and like crap)- but by the second day thats when I start to fall into my pattern of drinking again.\n\n",

   "selftext": "My father in law is an alcoholic.  My husband and I have been together 6 years, married for 4.  His family lives in a different state, but not too far away and we visit them/they visit us several times each year.  Every time we are with them, FIL has at minimum 12 beers and usually closer to 20+ in the afternoon/evening.  He ALWAYS passes out where he is sitting in the afternoon/early evening, then wakes up, drinks more, and eventually passes out/falls asleep on the couch or in his chair later on. \n\nEveryone ignores this.  It's clear he's been doing this forever.  He doesn't generally get nasty or belligerent while drunk though there have been some inappropriate and aggressive Facebook comments when he was clearly drunk and he always deletes them later.  The problem is that now we have kids.  Our oldest is two and a half, old enough to notice her grandfather is asleep on the couch but not able to understand why he doesn't wake up when she calls his name.  The first time this happened I was just taken by surprise, didn't know what to do and clearly nobody else in the room did either.  Later I realized it's not ok for this abnormal behavior to be ignored and treated as normal.  This is not an ok example for our children. \n\nMy husband and I have spoken in vague terms about having to address this once there are kids in the picture, but never got specific.  After the last visit, I told him it was time for us to do something.  I told him about our daughter asking him to wake up and everyone ignoring it or just redirecting her.  He had never been around for that to happen.  He agreed but said he didn't know where to start. I'm planning to go to an alanon meeting but with a toddler and a newborn it's difficult to get it together. \n\nSo I'm not sure where to draw the line.  We will visit but not stay with them?  They can visit but no drinking?  I'm afraid that one will result in us becoming the alcohol police in our home and having to ask him, drunk, to leave if he starts sneaking alcohol.  I just don't know.  But I'm pretty sure he's never had any treatment or counseling in his life, probably needs detox to get off of it and we are going to be VILLAINS for addressing this because nobody ever says anything, especially not to him.  Especially me because I did bring it up once, to him in a private email after a particularly egregious Facebook comment on one of my family member's page, on a post that family member had tagged me in. I explained why what he said was so offensive to us and that kind of hateful speech won't be tolerated especially in front of our children, and suggested that if it had something to do with his drinking maybe he should get some help. He replied essentially denying any wrong doing, no apology and no comment about the drinking.  However, it has been made aware to me that he shared this with his daughter (my husband's sister) and she said I was  \"out of line\".  This is going to cause a serious rift in his family and I think I am going to be blamed.",

   "selftext": "I've tried to quit drinking many times. I even took a year off a couple years ago, and from my high horse, I thought I could then start moderating. Turns out, no. I cannot, like many of you.\n\nI've tried quitting since then and often came back to post here to rant, celebrate wins, and confess relapses. I couldn't understand how I was able to stop for an entire year but just a few sober days or weeks now seemed impossible. I was expressing my frustration when u/Thornkale (THANK YOU!) said, \"Nothing changes if nothing changes,\" and asked me a simple question: \n\n\n*\"What tangible actions are you going to take to remain sober?\"*\n\n\nIt struck me, hard. Until then, I never thought to make a sort of \"action plan,\" a step-by-step procedure for what I will do when cravings strike while at home, while out, etc. So this time, I did just that. I realized this morning that maybe others would want to see it, that maybe it could help inspire their own. \n\nDisclaimer: I've never participated in a step program, but I've adapted some methods (like HALT) from existing techniques. Also, I know I'm only 4 days in right now, so time will put this to the test. But I've already referred to it multiple times, and it feels like I have someone rooting for me 24/7... the determined, level-headed me reaching out to help the addicted, dopamine-charged version of me.\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps!\n\n\nSTEP 1. I will put my sobriety FIRST.\n    1. Before relationships: I recognize that sobriety will strengthen those that matter and only erode those that don\u2019t.\n    2. Before diet and exercise: I recognize that increased energy will come with time. And while I will be careful to not replace one vice with another (junk food), I\u2019ve got a few calories to spare by not consuming the empty calories of alcohol. \n    3. Before my career: Sobriety will make waking up early easier. It will also improve my job performance. But if a work-related social gathering threatens my sobriety, I will follow the guidelines in Step 5 below, and leave if necessary. \n\n\nSTEP 2. I will tell my partner (family, close friends, etc.) plans for quitting alcohol entirely. I cannot control how they initially react to this.\n\n\nSTEP 3. Daily check-ins on r/stopdrinking. \n\n\nSTEP 4. When a craving comes on at home, I will: \n    1. Acknowledge the craving and my ability to ride it out.\n    2. Use HALT (Hungry or Happy, Anxious or Angry, Lonely, Tired) to determine the trigger of the craving and address it at its source. \n        1. If I\u2019m hungry, I\u2019ll eat whatever I want. If I\u2019m happy, I\u2019ll celebrate without alcohol. \n        2. If I\u2019m anxious, I\u2019ll do something to keep my hands and mind busy, meditate, or do something else relaxing. If I\u2019m angry, I\u2019ll go for a run by myself.\n        3. If I\u2019m lonely, I\u2019ll journal, go on SD, or contact a friend to talk or hang out.\n        4. If I\u2019m tired, I\u2019ll read a book, take a nap, do an energizing breathing exercise or 7-minute workout, or have some coffee.\n\n\nSTEP 5. When confronting temptation while out, I will:\n    1. Acknowledge the craving and my ability to ride it out.\n    2. Prepare by bringing a seltzer water with me.\n    3. Research whether the destination has exciting non-alcoholic options. If it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll seriously reconsider whether or not I need to go.\n    4. When offered a drink, I\u2019ll do more than just turn it down. I\u2019ll say, \u201cNo thanks, I\u2019m not drinking tonight,\u201d in order to prevent subsequent offerings.\n    5. I\u2019ll take a break from the situation and go on SD for a few minutes. If simply reading posts doesn\u2019t help, I\u2019ll send a chat request or message a trusted sober friend.\n    6. If it doesn\u2019t subside or I feel like I can\u2019t concentrate on and enjoy my surroundings, I\u2019ll politely excuse myself. I will remember that I don\u2019t need to justify my leaving. I can simply say, \u201cGood seeing y\u2019all, but I have to go!\u201d\n\n\nSTEP 6. When someone asks me why I stopped drinking, I\u2019ll say, \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t fun / It doesn't serve me anymore,\u201d with a smile! - &amp; go into more detail if they\u2019re interested. \n\n\nSTEP 7. I will continue to read relevant/timely chapters of This Naked Mind every day\u2026 on the hard, the easy, and the OK days.\n\n\nSTEP 8. I will participate on SD whenever I feel pulled to, by posting or commenting.\n\n\nSTEP 9. I will practice self-love, self-care, and self-forgiveness.\n\n\nSober on, friends. We can do this together.\n\nLove, Chair\n\n(Edit: formatting)\n",

It didn't actually ever happen, but I always felt like I needed a toilet closeby or things would end badly. I got a therapist, got diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and started working on it. Improved ove time, but hit a plateau not too long ago making it hard for me to progress more. \n\nFor example, public transport and going to college is still hell for me. That's where alcohol comes in.\n\nWhenever I have to undertake something that's still way out of my comfort zone, I have 3-4 beers or 2 glasses of wine to calm my nerves.  I don't drink during other stuff, just before I have to get out to go on a bus or go to college. Just enough to get a little buzz and be comfortable.\n\nSome weeks, this means I'll drink a crate of beer (24 bottles) over the course of 5 days, other weeks I'll have maybe 10 in total.\n\nI'm trying to drink less and less as the weeks go by, and it's working slowly but surely.\n\nWould this make me an alcoholic? I don't crave alcohol, only when I need to face my anxiety heads on.\n\n\n*TL;DR: Have bad diagnosed anxiety, use alcohol to calm my nerves for certain things.*",

He joined the military young and from there he moved in to a very successful job abroad (He's from the uk), but in September last year he called to tell us he was moving home. \n\nHe confessed he had lost his job due to getting caught drink driving for a 2nd time, and within a week he was back home living with us, and we realised just how bad his drinking was. He has barely squeaked out a weeks worth of sober days in the last 8 months, and has been sleeping on our sofa this entire time, when we initially thought it would be 2-3 weeks to get back on his feet and find his own place. \n\nHe came home with zero savings from an almost 100k a year job, and has recently (the last 2 months) found himself a good job again.

He's currently not driving, which is a relief, but it means I'm driving him to work at 5.30am before I start work, and by 7-8pm when I come home he is usually passed out drunk on the sofa. When he works late I drive to pick him up at 10pm, I have done literally everything I can to help him get back on his feet but he just spends all his money on booze and is only sober during work hours. \n\nWe (our mum and myself) have spoken to him at least 10 times about quitting drinking, we've threatened to kick him out and told him how much hassle he causes being drunk every day, but nothing seems to work. We've tried the soft and caring approach and the harder more angry approach.\n\n When he's sober he's smart and funny and it's good to have him back after 12 years of him mostly being away, but I only get my brother for about 10% of the time, the rest of the time I get an alcoholic who is barely present.\n\nAny help would be hugely appreciated, I simply don't know what the solution is here, and I don't just want to kick him out and see him spiral further because I know he's a good person and he doesn't do anything malicious to try and hurt anyone. \n\nSorry for the big read!

I get stressed out about it and worry excessively and I really don't know how to stop. I don't want to be a buzzkill, but for me partying and drinking excessively is a no go. I get concerned about people I love being in the party scene, especially when I'm not there to make sure they are okay. \n\nOne of my closest friends is going out this weekend with some older people and it gives me a lot of anxiety. I'm trying not to fret, but I would hate for him to get into a bad situation. I don't think that hookup and party culture is what is best for anyone longterm and him going out with party girls scares me a lot. \n\nAny thoughts on how I can begin to get over this?",

While I\u2019m no longer with him, there are things that happened during that time that make me stop and think with a new perspective.\n\nIt was St. Patrick\u2019s Day weekend and we were living in Chicago. This was before I knew he was an alcoholic. He had wanted to try this restaurant and bar place with a fireplace inside. We had talked about going there, but never really made any plans that were written in stone, and we didn\u2019t call to make a reservation or anything. So we had talked about how maybe we could go to that restaurant like the following day. However, on the following day we made tacos and ate them at home, and we also had plans to go to see a comedy show at a club that evening. I didn\u2019t think we would be able to eat at the restaurant, besides, I didn\u2019t think it made much sense to eat a bunch of tacos, and then a couple of hours later go and eat at the restaurant, and then go to the comedy club, but that\u2019s what he wanted to do for some reason? He wanted to go to that restaurant and \u201chave a nice time\u201c...he was always talking about \u201chaving a nice time\u201d even though he would be smashed for most of the things he wanted to \u201chave a nice time\u201d at.\n\nSo we made and ate the tacos, and I decided to go get ready for the comedy club. Maybe I should have communicated a little bit better, or asked questions, but I didn\u2019t.  So we ended up skipping the restaurant, and it ended up being my fault somehow.  I didn\u2019t think skipping the restaurant was that big of a deal, but he did. I don\u2019t really know why. I just remember we were standing in line waiting for the comedy club to open up. We were standing in line with a bunch of other people waiting to go into the comedy club. And he was angry at me for some reason. He kept mumbling under his breath, \u201cevery f-ing time, you do this.\u201d I\u2019m guessing he meant taking a long time to get ready, but I really don\u2019t know. I just remember feeling bad that he was mad at me. Looking back, I\u2019m sure it had something to do with alcohol and he was mad that he had to wait a whole 2 to 3 hours for the complimentary drinks from the comedy club.\n\nWhich, we had to leave the comedy show early because he fell into the aisle during the show.",

Didnt think much about alcohol or drink beyond that.  \n\nUntil last Friday, when I drove to Tucson, AZ.  Tucson is this shitty little town where I went to college.  It's where my alcoholism developed, where I dropped out of school, but I have tons of friends there.  My hair stylist also lives there, so I drive to Tucson to see him and get my hair dyed.  Im weird, and getting my hair dyed red is part of my identity.  Lately my scalp has been a little damaged from allergies and itching, which makes the dying process unbearable, so I normally have a painkiller or a few drinks before he starts.  Only thing is, this time, I didn't stop.  Over the course of a good 4 days, I drank 2 bottles of wine, and 3 bottles of hard liquor.  \nI made a lot of really bad sexual decisions, as well, so now I'm very scared for my health.  And there isnt a lot I can do about it except abstain from sex and wait 3 months to get tested.   \n\nHere's to starting over.  I love that I was able to drink with family without any negative consequences.  But it's fair to say that at this point, it's just too great a risk for me to think I can entertain that sort of control.

Now he's in Seattle living off of some girl, always telling me how he's going to \"Get a job soon.\" He's had electroshock therapy for his depression and just never came out the same. \n\nI mostly grew up with my mom and she always was a tough love person. I hated her rules and judgemental view of people, although I love her perhaps more than anybody in the world. I think she may be the root of my social anxiety, which I think is a big foundation of my drinking. I've been to rehab, been to AA, and just have no idea what to do next. I've worn out my welcome with my roomates because I can't keep a job. I'm a fucking mess. I don't know what to do.",

   "selftext": "I'm going to try and keep this short. I live in New Orleans and have been here since I was just a toddler. I forgot who said it first, but New Orleans truly is a city full of alcoholic Peter Pans. I grew up in this culture of drinking and soon enough, it rubbed off on me. It started with just binging on the weekends, but eventually I was choosing \"daily moderation\", basically picking up a six pack every afternoon or two tall boys and some vodka. For what seems like 10 years now (I'm 30), I've somehow managed to maintain this lifestyle. No matter what job I've had or relationship I've been in, I've made sure to drink at least 4 beers every day. Down here, this is pretty normal. In fact, most of my friends drink daily as well and who can blame us all for drinking so much when that is such a main attraction of the city itself? People flock here from all over the world to experience the freedom of getting wasted in public. Anyway, after a lot of thought, I have decided it is time to quit for as long as possible. To me, it is more than just the feeling or the clarity of being sober though. It is about taking a stand against the societal pressure to drink here in America and especially, New Orleans. Every few blocks in my neighborhood is another gas station beaming with neon lights exclaiming the various types of low quality beer they have in stock. Every festival, fishing trip, or outing down here seems to revolve around alcohol. Every band I've played in has had issues with alcohol in general. Anyway reddit, I hope I'm really done. I'm tired of waking up with a slight hangover every day, wondering why I grabbed that last beer when I was already sloshed. I'm tired of being on a first name basis with every gas station cashier within a five mile radius. I'm tired of spending my hard earned money on the daily bottle and neglecting my talents and potential. I'm going to keep writing as the weeks progress and hopefully, it will help me stay on track. Btw, I'm a total noob when it comes to quitting anything (I have other habits ::puffs:: ) , so any guidance would be helpful.\n\nEdit: So I've seen a lot of advice talking about the meetings. Just a note, I am in my senior year at UNO (Mechanical Engineering), and I work  almost 30 hrs a week so I have no time for meetings. I know I could \"make time\" , but that ain't happening any time soon.\n\nSecond, I just went my first night without alcohol and so far, all good. Waking up without that hangover feeling is insane. Thanks for yalls support and I definitely plan to write updates regularly.\n\nBout to google alcohol withdrawal symptoms... ",

   "selftext": "Hi.\n\nToday is my Day 1, and I would like to \"introduce\" myself because I have decided, after months of lurking, that I will be very active in this sub (I made a separate account, I didn't want to tie this problem of mine to my main account - is that acceptable?)\n\nOkay, so I guess I'll tell you about myself. I'm 28. I have multiple college degrees. I bought my own property and helped build my own house when I was 24! I have two dogs that I adore. I have a really good career and, when people find out where I work, they're either really impressed or *hate* the entity for which I work. I grew up in a nice suburb, my parents are still married (they don't really like each other though), and I had no childhood trauma that I can think of. I'm responsible, and generous, and have always had the ability to make people laugh. \n\nAnd I'm also an alcoholic. The binge-drinking kind. Would you like a brief history?\n* I would occasionally drink when I was in high school. Nothing serious; got sick like twice.\n\n* I was a responsible drinker (rarely drank at all) until around three years ago. This is when things started picking up.\n\n* Three years ago, I was dating a guy who would drink no less than 11 Miller Lites every night while playing Rust. I started having rum and diet drinks at night, too. And I'd drink with him at parties and get shitty.\n\n* After we broke up, I stopped drinking for the most part. But still preferred to write my research papers while buzzed.\n\n* At some point, about two winters back, I got really *depressed*. I had NEVER felt this way before! I had had normal phases of ups and downs, but this was different. Everything felt hopeless. The worst part was that there was no REASON for me to feel this way. And since I could not figure out \"why\" I was so depressed, I couldn't \"fix\" it. Guys, it was bad... brushing my teeth and showering felt like so. much. work.   I also started dating someone new. I shall call him Hunter.\n\n* During this depression, I drank like a liter of vodka at night, give or take, almost every night. \n\n* Depression lifted, but drinking stayed. It calmed down quite a bit, but I was still slamming liquor at least two nights a week.\n**During this depression, I GAINED EXACTLY 100 LBS!**\n\n* This past holiday season, the person I was dating was in an alcohol related accident. BAC was .26. Thankfully he didn't hurt anyone else, but he really hurt himself badly (frontal lobe TBI, two brain surgeries, a surgery to repair his carotid artery that was crushed in the crash, a surgery to fix his broken skull and face, and more) somehow, he is doing INCREDIBLY well. People say they would never guess he has a TBI, but I only know him as Hunter 1.0 (pre-accident) and Hunter 2.0 (post-accident). I vowed to quit drinking.\n\n* Hunter and I split up, on very good terms. Good news for him! He has been completely sober since his accident. He says he doesn't have the urge to drink, and I believe him (that frontal lobe damage can do some strange stuff)\n\n* Present day: I recently consumed almost a bottle of tequila on Monday night, and almost a bottle of vodka on Wednesday night.\n\n\nI am quitting. For good. Why? \n\nI feel guilty, there is nothing wrong with my life, and I shouldn't need to drink to medicate anything. I'm also sick and tired of having liquid yellow shits which I'm sure mean my liver is going to give up on me soon. I'm tired of going to work hungover. I don't want to be obese anymore. I am sick of having puffy, tired-looking skin and fucked up hair (Idk if alcohol can actually do that to you lol). Prior to this drunken spiral, I had been actively losing weight for three years, was weightlifting 3-4 time a week, and felt like a million dollars.\n\nI want to feel like a million dollars again.\n\nI'm sorry for the long post. I didn't know what to say so I just typed whatever came to me. ",

I'm just not feeling it right now and I feel I would be selling myself short if I didn't reach out one more time*\n\nI'll start positive: i've had a productive last couple of days. Yesterday I had a good, if slow, day at work, chaired a meeting, and today I made good progress on moving out of my house. I'm very grateful that I had some friends and family lend a hand today. I'll have seven months in about an hour on my  which is by far my longest streak out of four attempts.\n\nI'm sitting on my bed in my largely vacant  house and I'm struggling not to throw it all away. I'm tired of living life on life's terms. I don't have anything particularly difficult to deal with but existing with myself makes everything difficult. I'm having the same issue that brought me out before and that regularly gives me distress: the second step. (Step 2: became willing to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity) I use a secular higher power but even if an omnipotent God exists I can't fathom the idea of being made sane, of being made okay. \n\nI deal with a lot of \"outside issues\" as they call it. I like to call it a neurotic clusterfuck, i've been seeing psychiatrists since I was a kid. I'm fortunate enough to have professional help but right now I'm in a pretty dire place in spite of that. In addition to that I feel like I don't have anything to show for my 24 years of life. I dropped out of college and I'm working in food service. I haven't even lived the party life that others in the program my age often joke about; my drinking was never about fun, it was medicine. I feel aimless and incompetent.\n\nI often hear that your \"bottom\" is simply whatever gets you to stop. But when I first stopped alcohol hadn't resulted in any real consequences. It hadn't even stopped being an effective solution. I quit because I was embarrassed that a cashier at a store I went to  had playfully called me out. I also have a sister (primarily addict) who has been sober for 4 years and I knew I didn't want to go to the lows she did. I'm at a place where I know I'm an alcoholic but I doubt a drink could make me worse than I am now.\n\nThere's a sentiment I infer in aa that if you're dissatisfied it's becuase of a lack of action on your part. This is very frustrating to me. I don't work a perfect program, sure, but I've gone to meetings almost every day since my last drink.  I really want it to be effective but lately it hasn't been helping me like it used to. Meditation used to ground me but now I can't quiet my mind. I feel like I'm deteriorating and I'm losing hope that sobriety can help me. And considering where i'm at, I can't help but feel that drinking might be a lesser evil. \n\n*again, this is not motivational, please don't use me as a poster child for sobriety*\n\nI've been engaging in self harm. I did before, but it's more frequent and intense now. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts for a while now. A few days ago I came close to a pathetic attempt that probably would have just ended with me in the hospital burdening my family. I'm not considering that option right this moment. Honestly, after writing this I'm not sure what I'm expecting. I don't want to lose all I have gained so I'm trying to reach out like I've been told to do. But I'm also tired of making my ilness the problem of those willing to put up with me, so I guess I'm pawning it off on a support group instead. Sorry, thank you if you took the time to read this",

So, I went to a couple AA meetings decided it wasn't for me and left after 2 or 3 meetings. I stayed sober for about 4 months until New Year's Day, when I had a little wine with dinner to celebrate. I stopped drinking again for about 5 months this time(until a couple days ago). This time I could barely get buzzed after downing half a bottle of Whiskey. Keep in mind I haven't been drinking this entire time, and haven't ever had enough to drink to generate any kind of immunity.

It was in a thread about people that went to their high school reunion and the worst case of someone that was popular in high school falling from grace. Someone mentioned that there was a person who wanted to become a motivational speaker and that he was three years clean from addiction. The comment stated that he didn't have a job, house or a wife and all he had done is stay sober for three years. I read that and was was kind of taken back. Three years is an astounding thing. The fact that he sobered up from addiction is amazing in itself and that he was able to stay sober for three years definitely merits himself to be a motivational speaker, no job, no wife and if he lived on a bench, hell i'd still listen to him. I do listen to motivational people 4 - 5 times a week, some with decades of sobriety.. and living on the street, with no wife and no job. This is a good reminder though that alcoholism and addiction are still a big negative in general society and it re enforces the anonymity that I have in my program.",

I don't have any particular trigger days anymore like 'oh it's friday, it's the weekend, i must drink more on these days' so i know i wont struggle on a weekend anymore than i would during the week. Perhaps it's fate that I was meant to stop work for a bit, purely for the purposes of making my getting sober easier. Everything for a reason.\n\nWell this is now the longest i've gone without a drink since I was in hospital for two weeks last year. I'd been vomiting constantly all day, ended up vomiting blood and my urine was practically black. Got blue lighted over to hospital where it emerged i in the end that i had severe hepatits and acute kidney injury among multiple other things. The consultant said my liver Transaminase values were too high for it to be caused by alcohol \\(ALT was 7000 \\- yes 7k, normal is around 40\\-50\\) and that it was caused by either poisons or illicit drugs. I had in fact had a 12 hour cocaine binge a few days prior but i didn't admit to it as my Dad was in the room (I used to do it once or twice a year). Anyway so I was discharged from hospital having almost died of liver failure, buy as it wasn't 'alcohol related' i thought \"i can get straight back on the sauce!\". I was such an idiot. My liver had taken a battering regardless of the cause. An alcoholic will always find any excuse.\n\nThis journey has had many ups and downs, and I don't just mean this week. I've known for a long time that i've had to cut down or stop, i've had pancreatitis in the past, but nothing seemed to stop me. I've made loose promises to myself and others before that 'i'll cut down' or i'd lie through my teeth and pretend i hadn't drank in days or weeks when in actual fact i'd been sat at home on my own day after day drinking as much as could afford until i passed out. I've spent every bit of money on alcohol, even choosing it over birthday and Christmas gifts for my family and friends. Even the threat of my brother stopping me from seeing my 2 year old nephew wasn't even enough.\n\nThis time is different. This time I mean business. I don't care how tough it gets, how much i cry or how much i sit there shaking with anxiety, i will NEVER give in to the evil poison again. If the cravings get too bad, I'll get something from the doc to help with them. Similarly if the anxiety and depression get too bad, I'll get my doses of meds adjusted. For anyone thinking 'i don't want medication' well you've been medicating with alcohol so this is a better alternative and it doesn't have to be forever.\n\nAll you guys have SD have got me to 5 days through your loving support, and honest posts. I know that if ever I do get the urge to cave, which I'm sure I will, I will come on here first to get words of wisdom from you guys and to make me rethink. To anyone who is struggling right now, we are all in this together so KEEP COMING BACK!! \n\nIWNDWYT",

   "selftext": "This weekend is Memorial day and I expect it's a challenge for many of us. I'm freshly sober and am curious about peoples approach to this situation.\n\nMy personal situation is my family is visiting some friends of their mother with me included. Everybody there will start drinking around 4PM and go till 11PM. They'll drink within what is considered acceptable while I'd usually be keeping pace and sneaking refills to hit oblivion right around bed time. Unfortunately got quite good at that sneaking. \n\nSo this time I'm gunning for 0. I am not announcing that I'm an alcoholic to these people or anything close to that. I haven't told anybody and will be starting that with close friends.\n\nSome approaches I'm considering are:\n\n1) I'm on a diet or a cut and am keeping calories to 1500\n\n2) My stomach has been off so am taking a break from drinking.\n\n3) Getting one glass of wine and just not drinking it but pouring some out every 10 minutes or so (this would never work but would be easiest socially).\n\nBesides just saying \"no thanks not tonight\" are there any other stop gap techniques for doing 0 drinks while others are in a confined social space imbibing?\n\nEdit: Dislike lying, but really to close to my quit date to take the pressure of confronting a blanket \"no thanks\" in small quarters.  At a party no problem, but this is going to be a living room with 4 adults for 6 hours of basically wine tasting...kind of feels like I need to not go.\n\n",

   "selftext": "My husband has a job interview this morning.  It's a job he really wants.  He has always had a commute to work, but what he really wants is to be a contributing part of the well-being in his own community through his work.  I shined his shoes for him this morning and ironed his clothes.  I poured love into shining his shoes, especially, because it reminded me of when I was a little girl shining my father's shoes for different special events.  He was a plumber so he had lots of work clothes and boots and just a little bit of nice clothes and shoes.  \n\nMy dad is an alcoholic.  Because he inspires so much empathy in me, it is hard to even say that he is an alcoholic.  He was a very rough parent.  Words failed him and his temper was frighteningly hair-trigger.  He was raised in very poor conditions, economically, emotionally, and physically.  It's so bad that he mostly doesn't speak of it.  The things I remember about my childhood with him, though, are going out with him to have a donut and chocolate milk on Saturday mornings, shining his shoes and having him admire my work, and water fights with the whole neighborhood with my dad standing on the roof of the garage with the hose, spraying kids in the face as they tried to scramble up the TV tower and overpower him.  My mom would grab me and my brother up and hold us because the water fight was so raucous and wild that we had to sit out and watch for our own safety.  \n\nAs I forgive myself for my flaws, all of them, not just drinking, to the best of my ability, I just want to say to you parents and those of you with parents (so I guess that is all of us), just forgive as much as you can.  For your own heart's sake, forgive and go on and sew together as much bits of joy and happiness as you can.  Thank you for helping me, every single member of SD.  ",

   "selftext": "So, my fiance and I come from different cultures. In my culture \\(and I thought most\\) it is customary for the bride's side to throw the shower. The shower is meant to be about the bride getting together with friends and family close to her, or so has been the case with every shower I've been to. \n\nMy FMIL insisted on throwing a shower right from the start. The shower would consist of all my FMIL's friends and of course I could invite people \\(but I don't have anyone to really invite\\). I reluctantly agreed at first because I was put on the spot \\(not something I wanted ever\\) but then told her I don't think it's a good idea. I also told her my mother is hurt because my sister is my maid of honor \\(but she's like 13 years younger than me\\) so my mom thought it would be our family's thing to do. My MIL backed off for a bit. \n\nThen a month later, I get a text from my FMIL telling me to send her dates I want for the shower because her friends want to throw me one. Now, I don't know her friends, but my FMIL said that her \"crew\" throws showers for each other's children. Without going into too much detail, I reluctantly said ok again because if I don't my FMIL will throw a party after our wedding for her friends to attend. So I'd rather just get it out of the way now. I did tell her I wasn't sure if my mom would feel comfortable going and that there wouldn't be anyone on my side going \\(my friends are all out of town and if my mom isn't comfortable going neither will my extended family\\). \n\nMy FMIL told us where she was thinking of doing the shower and it's a place with a lot of meat, barely any vegetarian options. My fiance and I are both vegetarian \\(he will be attending\\). He told his mother not to have it at that place and she should look into a place that is more vegetarian friendly. She didn't. She ended up still booking it at the place she was asked not to without asking. \n\nSummary: \n\nReasons why my mom doesn't want to go, which I also think is justified: \n\n1\\) Culturally the bride's side throws the shower and she feels like my FMIL is stepping out of her boundaries. Also, FMIL doesn't have the common courtesy of including my mother in any of the planning at all. \n\n2\\) Religiously my mother does not drink alcohol and doesn't feel comfortable around it. All my FMIL's friends are drinkers so there will definitely be alcohol. I personally don't feel comfortable around it either and am not a drinker. My fiance is actually a recovering alcoholic but my FMIL still drinks in front of him.\n\n3\\) My mom can't eat meat unless it is prepared in a special religious way. Yes, my FMIL knows this. So not many options for her to eat either. \n\n4\\) My mother doesn't do well in social settings, especially around people she doesn't know. \n\nIf my mom doesn't decide to go to the shower I don't know what to say. I was going to say the truth. I don't want my FMIL's friends to think my mother isn't attending because she doesn't like my FMIL because that is not the case. \n\nMy FMIL is excluded from a lot of events from her husband's side of the family because they don't like socializing around her. At first I thought it was because they were biggots since my FMIL is Jewish. But now I get it. I think it just may be her that they have a problem with because she is very very pushy and won't stop till she gets her way somehow. My fiance doesn't want the shower and gets why my mom wouldn't want to go, but I'm curious if others, like my FMIL's friends would. ",

Depending on the algorithms, you\u2019re seeing website ads full of yard tools, grilling ideas, and booze, booze, booze.\n\nTwo of the most useful tools I know for heading off and then dealing with cravings are [HALTS](http://bradfordhealth.com/halt-hunger-anger-loneliness-tiredness/) and [DEADS](http://blog.smartrecovery.org/2012/04/10/5-ways-to-deal-with-urges-and-cravings/#.VpM_730rKVM)\n\n**H**ungry  \n**A**ngry\n**L**onely  \n**T**ired  \n**S**tressed  \n\n**D**elay/**D**istract\n**E**scape  \n**A**ccept  \n**D**ispute  \n**S**ubstitute\n\n**HALTS** is list of self-care factors that I run through anytime I feeling out of sorts or that I wanted a drink. I had to address all of them, and only then could I consider picking up an alcoholic drink. I have to eat, talk to someone, relax, calm down, or even nap. Then, only after I am not feeling any of those feelings, can I consider if I still want to drink. It\u2019s also a good list to consider to head off uncomfortable feelings: make sure I have a snack, minimize my anger and stress to the extent possible, and be aware of how tired I am.\n\n**DEADS** is a useful set list of things to do when I have a craving. Addressing the factors in HALTS is an awesome way to Delay and Distract. I always have an Escape planned when I go to events, whether it\u2019s taking a walk, checking in on SD, or not going in the first place. I dispute my NEED to drink by realizing that, really, I just WANT one. I Substituted with lots of seltzer, fruit sodas, and juices. They satisfy many of the cues I got from beer--tart and tangy, fizzy, a cold can in hand.\n\nWhat sort of tricks have you found to address DEADS and HALTS?",

   "selftext": "Alright so I'm probably going to piss off a few people but here goes...  \n\nThe term alcoholic doesn't work for me.  When I was 23 my drinking started to escalate rapidly.  I approached my parents, doctor, and therapist about my alcohol use.  The decision was unanimous... that I didn't have an alcohol problem because I didn't meet a pre-requisite number of criteria to officially make it into the alcoholic club.\n\nI guess, for me, a better question is, Does alcohol fuck your shit up?  Because if I don't meet the pre-requisite criteria to be an alcoholic, then why shouldn't I just keep drinking?\n\nI think the Does alcohol fuck your shit up?  framework is a more effective evaluation tool than the black/whiteness of I'm or am I not an alcoholic.  \n\nEver wake up on Christmas Eve night not knowing where the hell you are with a rabbit bouncing around you?  \n\nEver wake up wondering who spilled water on you while you were asleep, and why this water smells kinda like piss?\n\nThose are some examples of questions that can help identify if alcohol fucks your shit up. \n\nIn the US, it's Memorial Day weekend.  This equals lots of alcohol.  I'm not going to lie, it'd be nice to sit out on someones back porch, about to eat an overcooked hotdog, while drinking a shitty lite beer.  The thought is better than the reality.   \n\nSo instead of asking yourself if you are or not an alcoholic, so you can rationalize having a drink, maybe try asking Does alcohol fuck your shit up?, and if that answer is yes, maybe skip that first drink.\n\nI'm not sure what this weekend will hold, but tonight I'm going to clean my kitchen because it's covered in honey from processing honey, give dog a bath, and watch a movie with my daughter.  \n\nWhat's everyone else doing tonight?",

   "selftext": "Today is the first birthday in 10 years that I won\u2019t spend all day/night drinking.  I\u2019ve never been a big birthday person, most people usually forget it, but I would always take friends out and treat them or host a cookout at my house and spend most of the time on the grill (and on some bottles). This year, i\u2019m in a new city with my family, no real friends here, and about 900 miles away from \u201chome,\u201d but I\u2019m looking forward to being sober for it and actually remembering all of it.  If I didn\u2019t quit drinking, I would imagine I would be headed to the store to get booze as soon as my wife got home from work, then would be happy drunk for a handful of hours with my wife and kids, and then most likely finish the bottle of liquor and grab another one from the store, drink a bunch of that while playing music too loud downstairs and being generally obnoxious, then getting in a fight with my wife somewhere around 3am because i\u2019m being so loud, drunk, stupid, and obnoxious.  Then, tomorrow she would still be pissed at me but give me a \u201cpass\u201d because it was my birthday, which would be different if I only did this once a year on my birthday, but this was a pretty regular occurrence on the weekends for me.  This might hit close to home for some of you, and for others, it might be very far from your experience, but I am glad to not have to deal with ANY of that shit this year.  I can actually enjoy today and the weekend without making myself look like an asshole and having people mad at me for things I did.  Also, no drunken text messages to people that i\u2019m embarrassed of the next day, which I would just drink more to not feel shame.  Hope everyone has a great day not drinking today!",

   "selftext": "This is my first time here though I should have come a long time ago. This will be a long post with a lot of backstory so I apologize in advance. My mom and I were extremely close growing up and she was nothing but loving and supportive to me. Two years ago, things took a turn for the worst. I wasn't aware until recently, but apparently she has been addicted to pain meds for pretty much my entire life- she sustained a near-death accident when she was 18, and has had numerous surgeries since then. As such, she was always heavily prescribed meds and became addicted. My dad and her would fight about this frequently (never to my knowledge, I rarely if ever saw them actually have any serious verbal fight, and they have certainly NEVER had any physical fight). Anyways, my moms doctors stopped prescribing her pain meds at some point along the line- and she switched to alcohol. She never drank heavily but definitely always liked beer and would drink more than most other parents- but never liquor. She switched to liquor and began drinking in private, hiding bottles in our house, etc. It got very bad very quickly, but we (my dad, brother, and I) had no idea as we had never encountered real alcoholism. She passed out on the floor when my girlfriend (now-fiancee) came over for dinner one day. This was the first sign of a real problem. This was on a Sunday, and I was so embarassed that I left the house (I was living at home at the time). I went to work the next day, and came home and went straight to my room. My mom came home from work and wanted to talk acting like nothing was wrong. I was still furious with her and said \"I'm not talking to you until you apologzie for embarassing me and until we sit down and have a talk with Dad.\" She tries to change the subject and I ignore her. She sulks upstairs (drunkenly, though I didn't admit it/notice at the time). About 30 minutes late y dad rushes into my room asking what the fuck happened to my mother. Apparently, he came home to her sitting on our staircase, swaying violently, blind stupid drunk, drinking a 750mL Tito's bottle straight. She was crying and babbling about nothing and he put her in bed upstairs. She threw up violently and was just losing it. I'll never forget walking up those stairs to see her- the stairs she carried me up when I had a broken foot when I was younger. The stairs she chased me up when we were playing. The stairs she cried when she watched me walking down them for my first date/prom/graduation/moving out for college. The stairs that held so many fond memories were now a staircase to a hellish nightmare. I traversed the dark stairs, hearing her wails and sickness with each step. As I turned into her room, there was my mom, a soulless husk of the grand woman I have so much love and respect for. In short, she said she wanted and needed help. We took her to the ER where she got some benzos and we came home. She began an outpatient detox because she couldn't miss work. Started therapy sessions and going to AA. Things were going great for awhile- she would talk about her sobriety and celebrate milestone days (1 week, 1 month, 2 months). But she slowly stopped attending AA (said she didn't like the old people and depressing nature of it), stopped celebrating milestones, etc. She relapsed. Not as bad this time, just beer, but still relapsed and we had to find out by finding the bottles. Rinse repeat the cycle- less emotional this time, more anger on my part but not outward, still very understanding. Same cycle, did a physician-appointed at-home detox of sorts with my dads unwavering help and support. Weened her down. Things went well for longer than before- about 6ish months. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. I am engaged to be married (September 15th). My mom had talked about this moment my entire life and LOVES my fiancee. Wedding planning has been difficult though. My mom will get emotional about things, and even angry/lash out at me over small things (she is NOT an angry person, always the sweetest, gentlest woman I've ever known). I lose patience with her- she will get mad at me for not telling her about certain things with the wedding, though I have definitely already shared with her these things. She becomes more forgetful- I ignore the signs and grow disdain for her. I share less and less with her and go home less and less (maybe subconsciously I know she is drinking again, but can't handle the heartbreak of the lies and to see her in that state). My dad and brother (both at home) say nothing to me. Finally, I go home one night to discuss wedding stuff with my parents. My mom does not look well and is being very loud/animated. She says \"why haven't you shown me the wedding registry I haven't seen that\" when I had sent her the link mere days before. We go on and more of this continues, and my dad angrily yells at me at one point that \"this wedding is getting out of fucking hand\", which is bizarre because he has nothing to do with the wedding, the bride's family is handling it all as is tradition here in the States. Anyways, my mom is clearly very drunk, looking back, but I deny the signs and just think shes being stupid and head home early. Lying in bed, I can't shake the feeling of how \"off\" everything felt- I had dreaded goin home in the first place, and wanted to leave as soon as I got there. My house used to be a place of comfort- my friends would all come there and chat with my parents for hours. They'd come in times of happiness and sadness, because they loved my parents and parents were both so honest and welcoming and happy. We were never the richest and had financial problems, but our bond as a family was always strong. Lying in bed, I was overcome at how that feeling had gone completely to shit. I was overcome with how the happy memories of my mom were quickly fading and were being replaced with anger and resentment. My dad called the next day to apologize for his outburst. I said don't sweat it, hes stressed with work and whatnot, blah blah. But I gather up the courage to ask if mom is alright. Silence. He asks what I think. I say I think she's been acting increasingly irrationally, is forgetful, and that I think she's drinking again. He breaks down. She has been drinking liquor again at an increasingly alarming rate. In the morning, at work, on the way home in the car, and at home. Waking up in the night to drink. Lying to us. The car has damage from where she has hit curbs/backed up into things. She had made my dad and brother promise to not to me, as they are enablers and I am not. The last time this happened I had said if she drank again she would not be invited to my wedding (I realize this sort of ultimatum is probably not healthy but I honestly have no idea what the fuck I'm doing and am just lost and said what I fealt).They had got in a fight after I left because she was so happy I had come home to talk to them and said we had a great conversation- my dad said she had not pulled it off at all and he was embarrassed by her. My dad goes on and on about how she never wants to leave the house, and when they do she embarrasses him in front of their friends. He says \"I am fucking dying, son. I cannot keep doing this\". My dad has always been the light-hearted \"funny guy\" amongst our family and friends- to see him like this broke the little piece of my heart left that my mom hadn't already broken with her constant lies to my face about her problem. We talked for hours, I broke down in tears at my fiancees parents house. They now know her problem because I couldn't hide my emotions. Fast forward to today- my mom has underwent another successful \"weening\" detox and is 1 week sober (according to her and my dad). She is seeing her therapist again and, in my opinion, is sober and doing well. However, she is still hesitant to talk about alcoholism, and will not admit to friends that she has a problem. She also will not go to AA (she says its too depressing). I am extremely concerned with her having another relapse. I am concerned (selfishly) that my own mother will be too drunk at my wedding, and will embarrass me. I am concerned we won't have a mother-son dance. But most importantly, I'm just concerned for her. All my love for her is slowly leaving and getting placed with resentment- having her lie numerous times to my face to hide her drinking has ruined my trust with her. I question everything she tells me now, even in times of apparent well-being. What can I do? I have no friends who have been in a similar situation to seek guidance from. I just want my loving, sweet mother back, not this hellish shell of what she once was.",

   "selftext": "   I recently got out of a VERY toxic relationship with a woman. She was a pill and alcohol addict who I tried to help get clean for too long, and the camels back finally broke when she came at me with a knife for confronting her about some mini wine bottles behind the dresser. I tell you this to illustrate she is a loose cannon(I\u2019m okay and my life is great, don\u2019t worry). \n\nAnyway, I recently opened an older laptop she was still logged into gmail on(I know I shouldn\u2019t have snooped anyway, but in fairness she was terrible and it gave me a good bit of closure to her terror.) apparently she cheated on me ALOT, which in itself I\u2019m rather ambivalent to. I already suspected it and she downgraded so oh well. What bothers me is I looked him up on Facebook, he was a co worker so I know him by name, and the affair overlapped with his marriage, the conception of his child and birth of his child. Given the emails I\u2019m also certain his wife has no clue. \n\nUnder no circumstances do I want this horrible person back into my life in any way whatsoever. Butttt my sense of justice makes me feel the need to let her know what\u2019s up.\n\nI guess my question is: is it morally right to tell her, possibly breaking up their marriage, letting her kid grow up a child of divorce, etc, or do I let her be blissfully ignorant( they look like a happy family at surface level on Facebook ). She\u2019s technically a message away and I just am at a loss of what to do.\n\nTLDR I know about a cheating husband and don\u2019t know what to do with the evidence.\n\nPS it might seem selfish but this would have to be semi anonymous to the wife, I really don\u2019t want to be involved in my ex\u2019s drama anymore.\n\n",

   "selftext": "It has now been over two weeks since my last drink. It has been relatively easy since the last two weekends have been quiet with not a ton going on. I was able to keep myself busy and not even really think about drinking. \n\nThis weekend will be barbecues, social gatherings and plenty of reasons to drink. I brew beer and that is tentative for this weekend too. This is going to be hard and in all honesty, I might cave. I just hope if I do I will be able to keep it in moderation and really only have 1 or 2 beers (famous last words). \n\nWhat I am struggling with is telling people why I stopped drinking. I have been using the guise of losing weight and being healthy, but that makes it sound like the is temporary and I will start being the same drinking person I was. I feel like I need to tell people the extent of my past drinking, but I am not ready to do that. (I am not sure I will ever be). My mom said she noticed that I wasn't drinking and said \"you weren't one to get home from work and have a beer\". I said \"Yeah I did\", but little does she know about the 1-2 750ml 100 proof vodka bottles I'd go through every weekend. Plenty of weekends, in the past 6 months, I would literally be wasted from Friday at 6pm to Monday morning. I would sober up for 3-4 days and start all over again. \n\nI don't want to get back into that sort of behavior. Even if I do drink this weekend, I don't think I will but I really don't even want to take that chance. \n\nMaybe I can just say I am sick and be anti-social. Being social around drinking has to be the hardest part of sobriety and I am not in a place where I am comfortable yet.  ",

   "selftext": "I'm 23 years old and I can't stand being sober. I have pretty bad social anxiety and spend most of my time alone. So, when I'm not either high or drunk, I'm bored and restless, yet too nervous to actually do anything that may lead to embarrassment or failure. \n\nAbout 5 years ago, after catastrophically failing at life, I started smoking pot. Things were shitty, and I felt shitty, and it was an escape. This became an everyday thing very quickly. Whenever I move or lose contact with my dealer, I switch to 'functional alcoholism mode' until I find a new one.\n\nI honestly can't imagine life without substance abuse anymore. I can't remember the last time I was sober for over 24 hours. I remember being pretty depressed and extremely self destructive before I started self medicating. I'm afraid that I'll go back to that person when I stop. \n\nI cant tell my therapist just how bad it is either. I'm too scared that she'll get mad that I've been hiding it. Last time I was serious about my problem, the doctor suggested rehab. \n\nI can't do that. I just cant. I would feel so, so, so bad about myself. I would feel guilty for taking away from addicts with a more serious problem. I would feel pathetic for not just stopping. I'm not a raging alcoholic or a hard drug addict. I'm not a danger to myself or others. I'm just a pathetic wimp who can't stand my own thoughts or emotions. (Note: please excuse my harshness. I dont actually think pot addiction in itself is pathetic. I think I'm pathetic and this makes me more pathetic)\n\n People would laugh at me. Not to my face, but I know that they would.\n\n I don't want to do this anymore. I'm sick of being broke and caring more about pot then myself. But without it... I don't know what'll happen. I dont know how I'll feel (other then bad). \n\nI'm telling myself I'll just wait for my meds to kick in (going on two weeks on antidepressants). But what if they never kick in because of all the smoking? \n\nI'm just really scared.\n\nEdit: thank you all so much. This is a really nice community and I'm glad I joined.

   "selftext": "Hi. Ive been to 3 AA meetings. A little about me:\nI binge drank as a teenager with my friends every weekend or so. I had a larger problem around age 18 and spent about 1.5 months drinking every second day. I decided I didnt like that and quit drinking for about 6 months. I gradually started drinking again, found myself in an emotionally abusive relationship, and was not drinking frequently, but each time I drank it was binge drinking to cover up anxiety and dread. As I got a bit older and got out of that bad relationship, I noticed that if I was in a certain 'down' mood or anxious, I was more likely to drink, so I was using alcohol to calm the anxiety (which it never did no matter how much I drank) or to keep myself in a mental down mood 'rut' because drinking was literally easier than doing anything else even though other stuff would have changed my mood (exercise! creating anything!). So I drank fairly infrequently for the past 3-4 years, but in the past year I've noticed that about 60% of the time when I have a drink I dont know if I'm just having 1 drink or more, it feels like it's not up to me in a way? So much mental energy has been used on Friday nights going back and forth between \"Am i just having one drink? But what if i want more? What if i drink too much? \nthen what if i do/say something bad? Should I even go? What if I feel anxious? Can i leave? Is it rude? Should i have another drink to not be rude?\" etc etc. I dont usually like to go out, maybe once every 3 months, but this is a conversation I have with myself. But sometimes I'm very confident that I can have just one beer, and have done so on many occasions, because i enjoy the taste of craft beer and dont actually like the feeling of being tipsy or drunk. Anyway, it's been confusing to not fit into the \"mold\" of an alcoholic, but I figured if I can't always tell if 1 drink is going to be 1 drink, and if I can't guarantee control over my drunk self, then it's better to stop than to hurt myself and/or others.\n\nBack to meetings:\nI picked a group that has a younger crowd so I'd feel more comfortable. I really like a lot about the meetings, but some stuff puts me off because of personal reasons, or has me feelings 'left out'. \n\nI like that the group is really good as in positive, funny, genuine, humbling. Its on a weekend morning, so it almost feels like church in a way? Like a place to discuss a larger picture, and I think this is mostly what I like about it. There is lots of laughter and honestly and vulnerability, and those things feel nourishing.\n\nI'm definitely put off by repetitive parts of it(reminds me of cult-y parts of church), addressing everyone with \"Hi (first name)\" and \"thanks (first name)\" when someone wants to share.\n\n I also don't care much about the chips? And the milestones? I view each day sober as wonderful and I dont care about the number, if its day 5 or 5 years. To be a \"member\" of the group I have to give them the day of the last drink I had? But this number doesnt feel important to me, I'm not shy about it, I don't feel shame about it, I just feel neutral. I can see why for most alcoholics its a HUGE thing though. \n\nThe 12 steps:\nI dont have interest in doing the 12 steps at this point, or ever, not that anyone has asked me to, and I know my opinion can change. They are talked about a lot, and I've read over them but there is definitely something missing when most of the people in the group have worked through them at least once, so people reference them and their experience a lot. I feel a little lost listening to these experiences, but can relate to some of them.\n\nIm also really not down with describing my lack of self control as disease. But I feel like this has been talked about a lot in the subreddits.\n\nEven though there are a lot of negatives or questions in this list, I'd say that I enjoy or find useful 70-80% of the meetings. I just don't feel like I have problems in some of the same ways people are talking about having problems and it doesn't make me feel 'fucked up enough' to be there, and that coupled with not interested in the chips or ever doing the 12 steps makes me feel weird when people wanna connect with me and have me come back. I feel like I have to sign up for it all for some reason.",

   "selftext": "For as long as I can remember I\u2019ve always loved to pick scalps, my dry lips, my nails, and my cuticles. But here\u2019s the story of the worst kind of picking I ever fell into. \n \nWhen I was 10, I got lice. My scalp itched a lot, so I asked my mom to check for lice, but she didn\u2019t find anything. I guess my in my really thick hair it was hard to notice. But I took her word for it. It still itches though. Badly. So I scratched. And I scratched so much over the next few weeks that I made my scalp bleed. And after it bled, any wounds I made from it I just made bigger. It felt good in a way. Fast forward a few more weeks. We\u2019re on vacation in Canada and my mom notices me itching, she also notices white flakes in my hair. She thought it could be dandruff, so she did a closer inspection. It wasn\u2019t dandruff. It was lice eggs. I was right all along. So we got lice shampoo and got rid of all of them. Case closed, end of story right? WRONG. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why. But what I originally did because of itching, caused me to actually find the best kind of picking. Better than nail biting, better than my cuticles. The consistency of the skin on the scalp was somehow different. More interesting. And i guess I started to feel comfort while doing it. So I did. I dug my nails into my scalp to purposely create wounds, so I can keep picking them. When they scabbed . It was amazing. It gave me even more to pick! So I picked the scabs. They were all over my head. But they were pretty small. My mom noticed the bleeding eventually. Since I was still young she found a way to control me and I eventually stopped. \n\nThen I turned 16.  I was in highschool. I was in high stress. I hated school. I hated home. I hated everything. I was laying in bed crying and my hands somehow got to my head. I remembered the relief I felt when I picked. So I dug my nails deep and I picked. I created two nickel sized wounds on my scalp. And where the wounds were, I balded; so now I had easy access to those scabs. I kept picking for 3 weeks. But I was so embarrassed. Why was I doing this? What if someone sees my head. I had to make sure my hair always covered the spots. If someone sitting behind me in class ever noticed I would die of embarrassment. I started forcing myself to wear ponytails. To cover them, to not pick them. And it worked. The scabs healed, I didn\u2019t pick. I was ok. I just went back to my old habits of lip biting and cuticle picking. \n\nThen I went to college. This was the most stressful place ever. Finals made me crazy. I was stressed. And again. Somehow I remembered the comfort of my scalp. So I started again, but this time was worse than all the others. I picked. And I couldn\u2019t stop. Sometimes I didn\u2019t even notice I was doing it, sometimes I did it on purpose. I dug in three different spots on my scalp. I tried hiding my picking so badly. When I would sit on the train, or in the library with my friends, I would pretend like I was just leaning on my hands ( like with my elbow on the table, holding my head), but I was using my fingers to pick. And I loved the wounds. I picked the sides of them to make them larger.  I bled so much. I scabbed so much. And before I knew it, I had two near fist sized bald spots on my scalp. They were no longer bleeding. They were pus. They were infected. But that didn\u2019t stop me. Wanna know why? Cuz when pus dries, it gets crusty. And crust was AMAZING to pick. I couldn\u2019t stop. It went on for months. \n\nIn school I\u2019d spend 40 minutes in the bathroom stalls picking. I only meant to do it for five, but I was so into it that I had to keep going and going. And I would lose track of time. I\u2019d be late for classes. And all I could think about was picking. \n\nWhy was I like this? I felt so ashamed. Who does this to themselves? I was knowingly hurting myself, and I kept doing it? I wasn\u2019t normal. It was so embarrassing. That\u2019s why I never told anyone. No one would ever see me the same. Not my best friend, not my boyfriend. Nobody. They would all think I\u2019m some kind of freak. That I was disgusting. \n\nSo at 19, I googled it for the first time. And you know what I discovered?? I wasn\u2019t alone!! There were people like me out there. I\u2019m a freak. But I\u2019m not a complete freak. There was something wrong with me that others had too. And thru my research I discovered that in that same year, this disorder was just added to the DSM manual. It was considered a psychological disorder. That somehow gave me some kind of comfort, So I grew some balls and I told my boyfriend. He tried helping me, he pushed my hands away, he even made sure my hair covered my bald spots when it was down; he did what he could. But I still picked. I went to urgent care to clean out my infected wounds, and I went to a psychiatrist.  I was diagnosed. And put on ssris. I stopped for a while. Which was good i guess. But I never completely stopped. \n\nI\u2019m now 23 and every few months, when my anxiety is high, I pick. And I bleed, for weeks at a time. But I\u2019m not embarrassed anymore. I told my coworkers my messed up little secret. And they somehow didn\u2019t judge me. They listen when I rant. And when I pick, my boss makes sure he keeps me busy with both my hands. Like stapling flyers to our paper bags, cleaning the displays at our store, even cleaning the bathroom. Because when my hands are covered in rubber gloves and bleach I can\u2019t really pick.  And my coworkers always slap my hands away when I try to pick. \n\nI also found some ways to cope. Sadly there are no fidget toys that really imitate picking skin. But I found something else. I don\u2019t throw away my prescription pill bottles, ever. I collect them and I always keep one or two in my purse. And when I need to pick I peel the labels off of them. And they\u2019re not those easy peel kind of stickers. They require a lot of work to pick off, I do it till every last bit of label is picked off. And it helps. \n\nYes I still go thru times where I reach for my scalp, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever COMPLETELY stop. But this has been my journey so far.

   "selftext": "TLDR:  should i try to smoke recreationally after having quit a daily habit?\n\nI quit smoking on 1/29. My psyc recommended I quit (i have bipolar disorder, add, and depression). I did what she said, because otherwise I would have to classify myself as an addict. I quit the same day I joined a transformation challenge, and I won, losing 20 pounds. I look great, feel great, and really changed SO MANY of my habits. I don\u2019t binge anymore, I exercise A LOT, and I\u2019m much more active than I used to be. \n\nIt\u2019s nice to not feel ashamed of my daily smoking. It had been nearly 15 years of that. It\u2019s nice to go out of the house more easily. It\u2019s nice to have the time to meal prep. It\u2019s nice to seek out my \u201chigh\u201d via intense exercise. \n\nHowever. \n\nI quit the same day I started taking an antidepressant. I also started a sleep aid that helps with anxiety and focus. I also started eating healthy 99.9% of the time. I started achieving goals. I started spending more time DOING things. Instead of melting into the couch and enjoying the high from MJ. But what is responsible for that?  So many things changed at once. \n\ni went backpacking a few weeks ago and smoked. I thought it was a good time to do it recreationally. Per my therapist\u2019s advice, I spent a few nights sober to fully experience the experience, so to speak. Then I smoked one night. Out of 4. \n\nIt was amazing. It felt like home. At the same time it felt like no big deal. I thought about it for weeks. I considered whether it would ruin the experience or enhance it. I worried that I\u2019d slip again into daily use. But when I smoked that night, i realized how small it really is. It makes me fuzzy. It makes me laugh. It makes me feel like I\u2019m as heavy as a boulder and can\u2019t move. \n\nI didn\u2019t fall back into a daily habit. Although it was hard. I wanted to. But I didn\u2019t. \n\nBut I\u2019m about to hit my 4 month mark (the length of time prescribed by my psychiatrist). I\u2019m 4 days away. Now it\u2019s my turn to decide. Do I smoke weekly?  Special occasions?  Never?  I legit don\u2019t know what to do here. I know it would be so so easy to fall back into daily. It feels so good in the moment. \n\nBut what\u2019s good for me long term?  What will help me reach my goals(5 more lbs, more focused at work)?  What is right for me short term?  I\u2019d rather smoke than drink. But I gave up both for 2 months. Maybe none is best. Probably. But do I really want to give up substances for life?  Shrooms are amazing. Drinking is fun with friends. Pot is fun on the couch with pizza and a great movie. \n\nI know this is a forum centered around people who can\u2019t do it here and there. People who are all or nothing. I get it. I was raised by an alcoholic. My brother is a victim of the opioid epidemic. It runs in my family. \n\nBut here I am, holiday weekend. Friday night. No responsibilities. I have gym class and yoga with live music and a haircut scheduled for tomorrow. Tomorrow is obviously not a good smoking day. Is today?  Is there a healthy medium?  Is it worth dipping my toe in the water again?  \n\nI. Don\u2019t. Know. \n\nAnd I\u2019m scared of making a decision. I\u2019m so proud of where i am today from a fitness perspective. Wine gets in my way. Weed has no calories (however the hunger thing is not ignorable). I just. I\u2019m struggling to decide what to do next. I struggled when my transformation challenged ended too. What will I eat?  What if I gain it all back?  As it turns out, I found a happy medium, and have maintained my weight loss since then. \n\nInsight would be appreciated. Anyone go back just a little successfully?  Anyone try that and fail miserably?  I have so much time under my belt at the moment. And oy, those first few weeks were rough. Do I really want to go through that again??\n\nTalk to me about this. \n\nThanks. ",

I was ten years old when everything happened and came out and I was put through even more.  I'm not sure when it happened exactly but she gradually began drinking more and more and then it was like one day I woke up and I was living with an alcoholic mother.  I had to take care of myself most of the time, cooking my own food making sure I got places like school on time.  Then when I started to date and came into my own as a person she got even worse.  It was almost like she resented me for moving on with my life while she was still stuck on the abuse that her husband did to me, but the sad thing is she continued to abuse me.  She would degrade me tell me that I was an ungreatful daughter, that my father didn't love me, that i made her life worse.

The first two months after the relapse were just the occasional social drink, I thought the sober time had, uhhh... \"cured\" me? Not sure about that logic.

   "selftext": "Hey all. First of all, I don't even know if this is the right sub to post this but some things are going through my mind and I just had to get it out. I just want to tell someone. Anyone. I like to consider myself a good person, but there are things in my past, horrible things, that I feel keep me from having a meaningful relationship and keep me from living my life to the fullest. I grew up without a father, and my mother was an abusive alcoholic and drug addict. We were very poor, my mom, myself and my sister living in Section 8 housing. My mother would often leave us with strangers I didn't know. A couple of times, when I was 4 or 5, I was sexually abused by two men. I have repressed much of the memory and exact details, but I still know it occurred. I do not remember who the men were but they very well could have been family members. I remember being sodomized and I'm pretty sure I was forced to perform oral sex. I did not know at the time I was being raped, I just thought it was a game. This is something that in my whole life, I have never shared with anyone. None of my therapists or psychologists, friends, family, girlfriends, anyone.  \nI've always just been so scared that I would not be believed, and that I would be humiliated. I would no longer be me. I would be that guy who was raped as a kid. Soon after the abuse, I went on to start playing \"games\" with my sister and other kids from the neighborhood. At the time I didn't know how bad the things we were doing were. I was just a kid. My innocence was taken from me, and I took the innocence of other kids like a spreading disease. These are things that keep me up at night and make me want to kill myself. I've struggled with anxiety and depression my whole life. When I was 8, I was sent to live with my grandmother in Florida. The first time I tried to kill myself, I was baker acted and placed into a Boy's home. I kept running away and was eventually let to stay back with my grandmother. I was very withdrawn and shy in school, I wasn't necessarily bullied, I was just... there. When I become an adult I was a little better, having jobs helped my social skills and I had a few romantic interests, however they never went anywhere... in fact, since childhood I haven't had sex at all. The idea of sex feels disgusting to me, I've literally been in bed with a beautiful girl who was naked and wanted me but I just couldn't do it. I try dating and being romantic and loving, but there's just something wrong... something off about me. I feel like I'm observing myself from an outsider standpoint, like all of my relationships with friends, family, etc. are fake and being a normal person is just a ruse I'm putting on to trick people. I sometimes feel like I'm not even a human being. I just want to feel like a person. I feel like nobody could ever love or care about me.  \nIf you are a male victim of rape, please believe me you are not alone. It's just that no male victim ever wants to come forward.\n\nThank you for reading this if you did, and I assure you not to be worried about me. I'm not a danger to anyone or myself. I just wanted to tell somebody my story in hopes that maybe I'm not alone in feeling like this, and hopefully get advice if anybody else has overcame similar circumstances.",

It\u2019s 7am and I\u2019ve been up all night with a crackhead. \n\nSo last night my friends and I are going out and I decide to pick up some coke to have more fun. So we are hanging out at the bar and closing time comes. I drive home and stop for some soda at a gas station. On my way in a guy stop and asks if I can take I\u2019m somewhere. Me being coked out I say yes. I ask him if he wants a line and he agrees. He tells me he smokes crack (difference between crack and coke). So I get to talking to him while I\u2019m driving and we go to a hotel and do a line before he goes in. and he goes in and asks to ring his dealers room.  Comes out a few minutes later and says he got no answer. So he asks me to drive him all the way across town to his house. I go and he tells me he has some beer and asks if I want to come in. Now when he says this I immediately wonder what if this isn\u2019t his house and I\u2019m about to help him break in. \n\n Oh shit. I\u2019m coked up so I go with it.  It\u2019s in a wonderful neighborhood so I get to asking him how he affords his with no job  he tells me his mother is in the hospital after she fell and broke her hip.  and his family asked him to watch it.  OkayWhynot.jpeg day okay and we go in. He opens the door and says he forgot to lock it when he left.  Uhoh this is where I start thinking the family is going to come home and I will go to jail for trespassing.   \n\n  We go in he says he can\u2019t find a beer so he offers me half a cup of tequila and juice that was already drank from in his fridge.  I say no because I\u2019m not putting my mouth on anything of his. So we sit in the living room he\u2019s pointing at pictures of his family and telling me their names. He seems to be thinking before he tells me their names. I don\u2019t know if his is because he is lying and this isn\u2019t his house or he is just high.  Ohshit.jpeg. \n\nNow I\u2019m sitting in the living room and we are smoking cigarettes and I put some coke on the table.  And we do another 2 lines. He asks me if he can take a little bit and cook it up. Sure why not. So I watch him grab a spoon and and baking soda and make it. All while asking him questions about his life. His responses seem genuine I guess but who knows if it was. So he does his thing and and sets it on the stool to let it dry he says.  So 20 minutes to by and 2 more lines and he says he will be back. I am using a club card to make he lines and made sure he didn\u2019t see my id to know my real name as I told him a false name. \n\nHe walks out to another room and smokes his crack and comes back and is out of his mind. He was using a screw driver to stir his water for his crack and I\u2019m constantly making sure he isn\u2019t wielding it in a great ending way. He asks me to hold his spoon my dumbass does. So we sit there in his living room and do a couple more lines and talk about life. All while I\u2019m watching him and he\u2019s completely high he is whispering to me now and I can barely hear him and he puts the tray of coke lines under the table. I ask him where it is because I wanted my line and he is just sitting there thinking as if he wants to play stupid but I assure him I left some on the tray. He gets me some bottles of water and I drink them.\n\n  So time goes by and  he is still high as a kite so I feel safe enough to tell him I\u2019m leaving. He asks for my number and I tell him my phone only works on WiFi.  I tell him I need to go I take his number to his house phone and tel him I will call him when I get home and I leave he also asks me to help him fix his screen door before I leave to which I say no. I make sure to take my cigarette butts with me and my bottles of water to get rid of evidence but now I\u2019m worried what if that wasn\u2019t his house and my finger prints are found or something. I didn\u2019t touch much and I took everything with my evidence on it with me. I\u2019m sitting on the toilet at home now completely terrified I\u2019m going to get arrested for breaking into a house now because he kept looking out the windows and telling me if I hear anything it\u2019s the mail man bringing the paper. \n\n  All in all not a good experience. He was nice to me. Telling me not to mess with drugs and stuff. But I\u2019m completely scared shit less right now. I screenshotted his address and dk what to do. All this when he told me his name at the gas station it was Jerome. And when I asked his name again when I was leaving he told me a different name.  I\u2019m home safe now but really scared shitless.

   "selftext": "Hello,\nI\u2019m 22 and living at home and just found my moms hidden stash of wine (the bags from inside a box of wine hidden in a filing cabinet) for about the fifth time. This is a fairly new problem, I don\u2019t remember her drinking much when I was a kid. When they were older, she and my Dad started enjoying  wine some more and until the last year or so she usually kept it to a glass a night. After finding the wine this time I just threw it out. I usually confront her about it but have given up on that because the conversation usually goes to four topics:\n1. She\u2019s not my problem to worry about. If it bothers me that much I can just move out (would love to if it wasn\u2019t for student loans)\n2. It hasn\u2019t affected her work so clearly it\u2019s not a problem \n3. She\u2019ll be able to stop before it gets to be a problem \n4. The only reason she hides wine is because my dad and I give her grief when she drinks.\nThe last one is her favorite. Neither my father or I mind if she has a glass with dinner (I\u2019ll even have a glass of wine myself some nights). We also don\u2019t comment when she has a second glass. It\u2019s when she takes glass three after having two big glasses that sometimes we mention something. She\u2019s never been full on drunk but it\u2019s still concerning (probably because her tolerance is up). The part that gets me the most is a few months ago her brother had to seek help for his drinking. At that time she even admitted she wondered if there was a genetic predisposition. She still made no attempts to cut back! What do I do?Am I over reacting? Who do I talk to? She\u2019ll refuse to consider an AA meeting because she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem. I don\u2019t want to tell my father about this latest find because he has enough going on (new manangement at work and stuff going on with my grandmom). My mom just started seeing a therapist but I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s mentioned her drinking to them. I\u2019ve considered calling the previously mentioned Uncle but I don\u2019t know what he could do. This has truly driven me insane. I\u2019m anxious all the time about her hiding wine and checking her hiding spots has become a part of my daily routine (that\u2019s how I found this wine). I hate feeling the need to check the wine totals every night but I really can\u2019t trust how much my mom is drinking anymore. Any advice you can give would be greatly appreciated.",

The hangovers, the stupid decisions that I make when I'm drunk, the absurd amount of empty calories, it's just too much.  My main concern is that I'm a musician and that I play in bars quite a bit, but I intend to stay sober regardless.\n\nI guess I just wanted to write it out, I recently found this sub and it seems like a nice and helpful community.  I will not drink with any of you today :\\)",

From what I heard and can witness from my childhood home he was indeed financially successful and *always* provided for my mom (divorced for 3 years now, my mother suffered from his alcoholism for 20 years) and their children, my sister and me. \n\nHe showed affection by providing, we always had plenty to eat, toys to play with, by teaching me and my sister how to fish. We both loved to see him so *alive* when some of us caught something.\nHe was never physically abusive, but emotionally he was and still is unreachable. \n\nFlashback to the present moment: me and my sister (26 and 24 years old) have lived in the Netherlands for 2 years now, my father has lived in our native land. His visitation was a waited one, of course we want to see our dad visit our home for the moment.\n\nWe spent 5 days together. It was truly a shock to see this man in such a *thirst* for alcohol. All he talked about was alcohol. Every single thing we did was centered around alcohol; \"let's have a pint for good times 'eh\". There was nothing about him that I remember from childhood. It was all just... *alcohol*. It was extremely sad to see my father, my childhood hero, destroyed by his addiction.\n\nDeep down addictions are about suffering. I know he suffered a lot in his life. Yet as his child I'm so angry towards him wasting his life like this, for not being there emotionally, for being so distant, always thinking about that next drink, for not helping me with my homework when I pleaded him. He was too busy dealing with his own addictive mind.\n\nNow, I can see this process of addiction happening in me too. Do I want to waste all that good inside of me? Every day I have a choice to affect that. I don't have children yet, but I know I do NOT want to be this kind of father to my children.\n\nLong rant. Lot of anger towards my father. It's better now.

   "selftext": "Hey. I don't really know where to start, but I'm hoping this will help me in some way. I'll try to be brief as I think telling my story to the full depth simply isn't possible. It's way too complicated, even to myself. Let's keep it as short as possible...\n\nI'm in my early twenties and ever since I was 14, my heart has been heavy. During that year I lost my best friend \\(she's not dead\\) and was groped by my mom's partner. I've never been the same ever since. Saying goodbye to my ex bestie felt liberating since she hadn't been treating me well at all for years and I had just realized that. Breaking free was my only choice, I believed, and it felt bittersweet but mostly good. This time was also the time where I was most fit, a few months prior to being groped I decided to get real about fitness. I did a whole lot of cardio in addition to playing sports and got into the best shape of my life to date. Because of this, I started to feel very confident both physically and mentally. Slowly but surely, my confidence level got lower and lower. It was the middle of the summer during school break and every adult around me was drunk. He touched me, very inappropriately. I acted out, screaming at the top of my lungs asking him what the hell he was doing. Seems like the rest of the crew were too drunk to even notice. They were a big group. He grinned and mumbled, then walked out. I couldn't go home because I was a long way from home, mom brought us there and she was too drunk to have a proper conversation with. I was very frightened. I had to go with him and mom to his place that night, sleeping at the room just right next to theirs. I still hadn't talked to her as I figured I couldn't with her being that intoxicated. I was scared he'd hear about it as well, as we really couldn't go anywhere \\(countryside with no public transport at those hours, and she was way too drunk to drive\\). I figured it was best to just shut my mouth that night and pray for the best. Nothing else happened that night. But I sure as hell didn't sleep soundly. \n\nFast forward 2 weeks and my dad overhears me and my brother talking about the incident \\(they're divorced\\). He instantly calls mom to tell her about it and she doesn't believe him. He puts me on the phone and I confirm that what he said is true. She's on his way to him and tells me \"what should I do now?\". I couldn't bring it to say \"leave him\". I thought it'd be so obvious, I was stunned by her question. The phone is hung up and I come to learn several years later that she never even talked about it with him. Basically, what happened was that we all acted as though nothing had happened. I didn't dare confont him, and I already felt betrayed by mom. I did make it very clear though that I didn't like him by staying in my room everytime he went to visit us, never seeking eye contact and generally just having quite a hostile aura. It got very intense, I was forced to live with him later on even though mom knew I protested. It got to a huge fight between him and me one day and I decided I couldn't take it anymore. Desperately, I decided to move to my alcoholic father who lived very, very, veeeery long from there. I won't say much, but it got super ugly. Not even in my wildest dreams did I think it could get worse than I had already had it. I got suicidal. I decided to move back. Choosing between plague or cholera. One was slightly better in the sense that I never had to fear being beaten or the fact that at mom's, at least I had a proper bed to sleep on and she didn't remove my door. I was never completely safe there either, but I got through it by crying silently in my room and always staying in my room. Those were some painful af years. Glad to have moved out.\n\nNowadays, I have a good job and I live with my boyfriend. We got together roughly 2 years after the groping incident happened to me. My biggest problem aside from what I've already mentioned \\(which is swept under the rug by mom, she married the guy just a few years ago\\) is the fact that I feel so extremely lonely and I feel like I'm an outcast. I have no friends to hang out with. I do have one good friend but she lives far from here and I cannot see her very often \\(maybe once or twice a year\\). I don't make friends easily. I'm not the type to hang where there is alcohol. I have no intention to ever drink, understandably due to my father and his many ways of harming us when under the influence. I don't want to study yet so I can't meet friends that way. I only have 2 co\\-workers and one of them I don't like all too much due to some unfair circumstances so I wouldn't want to hang out with her. The co\\-worker that I sorta like never responded to my fb friend request, lol. I've moved a few times during these years, to different cities. That's often an advice I see. To move to get new acquaintances and thereby new friends as well. It hasn't worked for me... I don't know what I am doing wrong. I feel like everybody just wants to party and meets friends that way. I don't wanna do that and I don't have a lot of hobbies that could actually be a social thing. I like singing, sewing. That's basically it. I'm not a very \"wild\" person, I'm more of an old soul/calm person. I feel like I'm a 40 year old trapped in a 23 year old body. I feel \"too reasonable\", too grown up, too boring to make friends. Where does a person like me even meet people and not hate being there? The only place I've ever met people organically before was school and soccer practice but even there I didn't really make friends with them. I've been friendless since I was fourteen! When I started junior high at 16, I \"made friends\" again and I was the only new face in the class since the others knew each other since before. My \"friends\" there ended up isolating me just a mere week afterwards. I think I might be scared to get myself out there again after that, I don't know. Why do some people make friends so easily and others feel lonely for years? It's almost been a decade of me having a malfunctioning social life now, and that's pretty sad considering I should be having the time of my life.\n\nThis wasn't brief at all, but this doesn't even begin to describe all of the incidences I've been through. That's why it's still so long... I feel like I'm breathing but not living. My boyfriend is a big part of me feeling happy sometimes, but one person is not enough. I need a life besides him to feel better because I don't want to smother him. I doubt this thing with my mom will ever resolve. There'll always be the \"pretending to be okay\". I'm hoping to receive some good advice about meeting new people and making friends. It almost feels impossible...",

   "selftext": "Growing up in an alcoholic household as a kid was challenging, not because I believed it was challenging back then, but because when I look back, I realize that I just swept everything under the rug hoping it would go away. I had no tools to deal with the nonsense my parents were making of their lives because all my traits and problem-solving skills were being taught to me by alcoholics. I know now that they were not only alcoholics, but they were mentally unhealthy, and booze just made it worse. They never had the tools to deal with life so how could they teach them to me? They used alcohol as their way to deal with life\u2019s problems, and in turn, that\u2019s what I picked up on and ended up doing it the same way. I actually hated the thought of drinking alcohol until I was in my late teens. I\u2019m not shitting on my childhood or parents, but this story wouldn\u2019t make sense if I didn\u2019t tell you what it was like. Even though I vowed never to drink when I was a kid, I still ended up drinking with friends at about the age of 18 and not once did I think it could ever become a problem because we were just having fun. I never thought about the fact that I would have to wrestle with my emotions, feelings, depression, and anxiety, because I hadn\u2019t known anything about the importance of mental health. Nobody wants to admit that they\u2019re sick, especially sick people that are teaching kids how to be adults.\n\n\nSo, knowing what I knew, I headed into adulthood believing that I was going to do great things in life. I had the optimism but none of the tools. I got into the car business at 18 as a salesperson and the cycle continued to get worse. I wasn\u2019t a drinker just yet but just about everyone I worked with was. It didn\u2019t take long for them to start getting me into bars, and it felt good because I was getting away with something, and more importantly, I was fitting in. I\u2019ve always had a lot of friends, but this was different, these guys were older than me and it felt good to be included. I had left the childhood where I was ashamed for having alcoholic parents, and instead, I now had alcoholic friends. It looks like I was paying attention to what I was taught when I was young.\n\nHow important was alcohol? Like a lot of young guys, it was all we talked about. We talked about how going to the bar to get drunk was the perfect thing for a car salesman because if you sold a car, you can go celebrate, and if you didn\u2019t you could go let off some steam. Either way, we were drinking. That should have sent me running away from the car business, but I saw nothing wrong with it. I figured that this is life and I\u2019m going to go with it. We went out all the time, and it cost me more money than I made, but it was fun. I felt like I was a part of something bigger than my childhood, and it felt good to be there. I was blind to the fact that these guys all had a serious problem. Here comes the cocaine! What a drug\u2026 for the first ten minutes. After that, you\u2019re chasing the first high you ever had but you never get there. For me, it was another bond with the guys, something else I felt like I was a part of. How I didn\u2019t end up a complete bust out (car guy term for loser), is beyond me. That was the life I was creating for myself with the life information I had at the time. Looking back, I feel like I should\u2019ve seen bad times coming, but what did I know?\n\nThank God it was easy to lay off coke when I wanted to, or had to, because I would run out of money. Either way, I was putting myself in a position of failure and I wasn\u2019t even 25 yet. I spent my 20\u2019s on a bar stool with people that didn\u2019t give a shit about me or where I was headed. I don\u2019t know if I cared about them either. That\u2019s not to say that I haven\u2019t made, and still have great friends from that time in my life, but you find out that people don\u2019t give a shit real fast when things go bad.\n\nI got married when I was 31, and by then, I was drinking daily. I had life altering anxiety and alcohol was the fastest way to cure it. I couldn\u2019t do anything or go anywhere without being in full panic. The idea of having to communicate with another human being scared the hell out of me. I had no idea what was going on. That anxiety turned on like a light switch and I was done. I had no answers and I was afraid to look weak in front of people. I had sucked it up for so many years, I thought I just needed to do it again, and that\u2019s how I lived. I don\u2019t even want to type this stuff from the memory of it, but doing it always gets me past it. That\u2019s one way I deal with problems now. I go back to a period of time when I wasn\u2019t doing well and write it out, so I can feel how I felt at that time. Many times, a new memory from a situation will show itself and that allows me to deal with it and assure myself that I was never in any danger. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trying to go back to my 5-year-old brain and tell the little guy that everything worked out.\n\nThere is way more to tell but It\u2019ll have to be another article, so I\u2019ll end it here with my point. From the time I could walk, alcohol was a big part of my life and continued to be for nearly 40 years. It was a major focus with everything I did, until I decided enough was enough, and decided to get healthy. If we can focus on making ourselves better human beings instead of focusing on not drinking, I believe that we\u2019d have much more success at becoming recovered alcoholics. I\u2019m going to keep telling these stories until people start having \u2018ah ha\u2019 moments in the comments section, and this spreads so far and wide, that we become nondependent on alcohol or can at least help the people who are. My whole purpose for these blogs is to help people understand that your recovery doesn\u2019t have to be a lifetime thing and you can be recovered. Just because I\u2019ll never drink again, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m against alcohol\u2026 just the abuse. Please share what you like!",

   "selftext": "Note: rambling post\n\nIn my late teens, I had a thing for a girl. She for me too. Stars just didn't align... until they did. \n\nStill remember the first date. Went to see \"How High\". The kiss at the end of the evening was an experience I've not experienced since: butterflies, fireworks, etc.\n\nSoon, we were hanging out often and became sexually active. One of those situations where young kids explored each other. I wasn't a virgin, but the first time with her,  I got so nervous, my heart was beating out my neck.\n\nOne day, she was real quiet. I'm thinking \"shit, I know where this is going\", and prepped myself to deal. But she got even more shy, stuttered, red in the face... \"&lt;My name&gt;, I love you\"\n\nI was shell shocked. I mean, I felt strongly about her but love? Had a long couple days thought and realized yeah, I do.\n\nWe were together much more often. I met her grandparents even. It got to the point that she would stay with me at the house for weeks at a time (made my mom uncomfortable).\n\nAfter a couple years, circumstances led to it becoming a distance thing. It was so awful being apart. I made it *sooooooo* much better for getting jealous and overbearing. It was my fault it ended. I had my night of rage: breaking shit, crying, drinking.\n\nBut it became evident that I was now broken. Just numb.\n\nI did everything to move on: lifting weights, drinking, pot (huge pothead for about 2 years), progressively heavier drugs, joined a frat, became very promiscuous.\n\nI decided to stay an extra summer semester after walking, just to do college things. Well, she didn't know. Figured since I had \"graduated\" and had a job up there, I'd be a text away. Text message at 10, by 10:05, I was rage quitting. Liquor, coke, pills. Last thing I remember was my frat bro kicking me out of the house for punching a hole in the fence. Came to the next morning, crushed.\n\nThere was another girl that was close: we kinda crushed for a year and just informally  went for it the last semester and summer before we moved on. But when we broke it off, it was different. We got upset, but it's one of those times you just look back fondly.\n\nAfter graduation, I entered the work force. I was nowhere near my friends, so I just sat there, sulked, and slipped into alcoholism. I needed structure, I converted to a different religion and it provided that structure, and something to focus on besides her.\n\nAfter a few years, I got married. It seemed like the thing to do. Shes from a completely different culture than me, but I thought whatever, this will work.\n\nWe got close, intimate. We had a kid. When his diagnosis came, it crushed me. I thought, what if I was still with her? Would I have a child who wasn't normal (whatever the fuck that means)?\n\nOne day, I got to thinking about her. That caused another round of chemical addiction. In the meantime, I decided to get my PhD. Just anything.\n\nAnother 5 years go by (now) and I run into her. She's divorced, couple kids. First  time I've actually come into actual contact in 14 years. Nothing has changed on my end.\n\nThings with my wife have deteriorated. Cultural differences are VERY apparent now. Just together for the kid.\n\nI got to thinking last night: I still remember everything about her: eye color (green), clothes size (4, she's still a 4), various birthmarks, the stupid laugh she has when you tickle her tat, her favorite dress, favorite perfume, favorite song (that lame \"Falling Even More in Love With You\") and even goddamn favorite cigarette brand.\n\nI know maybe 2 of those things about my wife.\n\nWe've kept in touch every so often over IM, FB but it's not the same. I have that wave of numb again when I saw her face to face. \n\nI am an asshole but I would leave it all for her. I mean, I'd want to take my son, but the wife is a vicious lawyer and I probably wouldn't see him again.\n\nFucking 14 years of this shit. It's obsessive. She's had to have moved on at this point, why can't I?\n\n*I'm so lonesome, I could cry*\n\n- Hank Sr.",

He just called from the airport and as anticipated is drunk. Flying is one of his favorite excuses to drink. The free alcohol in first class is a special treat for him. So, I am neither surprised nor disappointed. It is what happens / has happened.\n\nI have a few hours to think about it (I hope I don't spend a few hours thinking about it), but I am contemplating just excusing myself from the weekend drama altogether. I had hoped that the seven months apart would mean that once he decided to come home he would be ready enough. But maybe not. And I don't know that either one of us will benefit from the situation as it is currently unfolding.\n\nWhat I may opt for is to wait for him to contact me when he is sober. And I am clear that I do not know when this will be.\n\nI am heartbroken by what our life has become. But I can survive this. My friends and family are all at the ready to spend time with me and remind me I am loved and cared for.\n",

   "selftext": "I am 32 F .Married. No kids yet.\n\nThere are parts of my childhood I cannot seem to forget.\nMy father was an alcoholic. He used to beat up my mom pretty often. As kids, I and my sister would often join in the fights to save my mother. There was a terrible amount of verbal abuse as well. I was scared to face my friends from the neighborhood with whom I went to school. There was this weird thing that my mother had sex with my father in exchange for favors - money or something else. My mother once told us that their relationship was only about sex and nothing else. There was a huge amount of pressure to perform at school. My father would degrade us verbally if we did not do well. \n\nI had multiple failed relationships. Some of them were assholes, some felt I was too clingy - I am not sure if I was. I used to believe someone would come and be my savior. I was also bullied terribly at school and I never said anything at home about it. I realized only I could get myself out of the unhealthy environment so got a job and left the city.\n\nI had one more failed relationship with a person I trusted too deeply. He was extremely caring and loving towards me for almost 4 years. All of a sudden he decided to leave and marry someone else. I was shattered. I stayed single for over a year before I chose to get married.\n\nI had an arranged marriage - meaning I met and spoke with my husband only a few times before we tied the knot. He seemed to be older, mature and honest. The first year was a nightmare. I did not get along with his mother and there were huge misunderstandings. There was verbal and physical abuse on both sides. \nThings turned little better once we moved to a different city from his mother. Yet I find him emotionally distant and not tuned in towards my needs. He does not seem to have empathy when I need it. Sometimes I feel, because of my childhood, none of my adult relationships are working out.\n\nWhat should I do? Should I try to make things better in my marriage? Should I leave? Should I get therapy?",

It's also the first time I've worked from home. No Bueno. Two hospital trips in the last 6 months didn't open my eyes. \n I recently lost a family member who was an alcoholic but had 25 years sober.

Multiple fights with my wife the last two weeks, the fck ups at work and concerns over my health prompted me to make the decision. I'm fortunate to have access to medicines and advice from a dr respective to managing withdrawl. I feel like complete crap regardless of the meds. The anxiety I feel as my wife keeps asking me what's wrong just gets the wheels spinning even more. I can tell she is worried about me but my failed past promises I'm internalizing that she is over it. Add to the fact that we both come from families with alcohol dependence issues, I'm not sure she wants to deal with another drunk. I will not drink today but for me it's been hard.

   "selftext": "I almost made a throwaway, but I should just own this.\n\nUntil August 14, 2017 I was a daily drinker for 15 years.  I knew I was an alcoholic but I didn't care.  Like everyone else here I decided to sober up.  Literally every bad thing in my life was the result of drinking.  I wasted most of my 20s and 30s and I have to live with that.  The summary of what is going on with me is my alcoholism has shifted from daily drinking to binge drinking every couple months.\n\n\n\nThe pattern is always the same.  I quit, and after a couple days of feeling off, I feel good again.  I keep feeling better and better.  Its easy.  The ironic shit about that is its almost too easy.  When I start looking back at 50-60-70 days sober without it really being a struggle after day 2-3, the voice in my brain kicks in.  It tells me I'm a problem drinker that goes too far, but not really an alcoholic.  \n\n\n\"CtrlAltDelLife, alcoholics can't quit for months at a time like its no big deal!  Stop waffling between extremes and find some balance in your life!\"\n\n\nSo I do, and I end up on a binge for a week before I quit again and hate myself.  And the problem is I want to listen by that point.  I WANT to be able to go to happy hour after work once or twice a month.  I WANT to visit my family and sit with my aging dad on the back porch with a beer a few times a year.  I WANT those things back.  But that is not the reality of my mind and my body.  If I choose to be the person who can have those things, I'm choosing to give up and risk everything else.  I am much happier sober, and that leads me right back to giving in after a couple months when it starts to feel like, \"no big deal.\"  The fact I still romanticize it like that after a couple months isn't cool.\n\n\nThis time the cards really stacked well against me, and I saw it coming and did nothing to counter it.  In retrospect I planned this lapse.  I got a new job, a big raise, and a week off between jobs ending in a holiday weekend.  My wife loves me, but she doesn't drink and tends to follow my self assessments when I suggest these 2+ month stretches are a sign it, \"wasn't all that bad\", and \"I can be balanced.\"\n\n\nI have read/heard many times that the body and brains healing after long term alcohol abuse happens in some pretty pronounced phases.  2 of the big ones being 90 days and 6 months.  If that is the case I'm never even making it out of the first phase and I have no idea how good I may start to really feel.  I have also read/heard many times that relapsing after short duration of sobriety effectively reset the brain's healing back to day 1.  Not suggesting 60-70 days isn't good progress, but from a purely biological level its basically erased.\n\n\n\nI think it is time to legitimately try Smart or AA.  I need a continuous support system for when I start telling myself 2 months or more without any issues is proof of some bullshit.  When I romanticize the unmatched chilling out level and chemical euphoria that to be honest aren't even real.  I have avoided AA after some bad experiences in the past.\n\nI realize by typing that last bit I have sent out a telepathic signal that will summon Frank :)  But as I said, I'm going to try again because there are many different meetings and I live in a different part of the country now.  I need to find one that is right for me.\n\n\nThank you all for reading.  Lets try this again.",

Well last night he went out to get a soda and after being gone for a half an hour I had to call him to see where the hell he was because our son was crying for him as I was trying to get him to sleep. From the second he walked through the door I knew he had been drinking. His tone, his demeanor, the redness in his face. My heart was beating out of my chest. I asked him flat out and he denied it, then tried to change the subject. Asked me \u201cWhy the fuck are you doing this?\u201d Tried to make me feel crazy, made me doubt my instincts. I had to go to the rest room and gather myself and give myself a pep talk. I knew I was right, I\u2019m sick of being gaslighted. Eventually he admitted to having one beer. The only way it would have been one beer was if it had been one of those double bottles of IPA. Ah, verbal loopholes. I gathered my shit and went to the couch, started having a panic attack and crying. He followed me, I begged him to leave me alone. He ended up passing out asleep sitting up next to the couch in the span of about 3 minutes. I just laid there looking at the back of his unconscious head. He came to a minute later and tried to play it off in case I\u2019d noticed it.\n\nI eventually got in bed because i wanted to be close to my son.\n\nToday he\u2019s sucking up, telling me I\u2019m amazing and I make him a better person, sending me all kinds of photos of my son at the park, etc. I don\u2019t know what to do.

This had put me to sleep since I first got drunk the first night of my study abroad almost four years ago. \n\nNormally I would chalk it up to random insomnia or whatever, but mainly I knew it was because at her house or when she was with me, I couldn't drink.

I broke down in tears and told her the reason that I couldn't sleep is because I used excessive amounts of alcohol to get myself to sleep.

We were both crying and she was so kind and generous and sweet about it and promised to be as supportive as possible. \n\nThat was about two weeks ago. As I write this is it 2 in the morning. I have given up trying to go to sleep tonight. She is fast asleep as she has been since about 11.  \n\nThis is truly awful. \n\nI didn't sleep well last night.

Instead I was laying staring into either my eyelids or the back of my sleep mask that I had bought to help me fall asleep. \n\nI have tried just about everything. Valerian root, Chamomile, Lavender, Lavender and Chamomile, tea made out of calcium, red leaf kratom, CBD oil, keeping \"dark comfortable places,\" taking a shower/bath before sleep, using lavender essential oils, playing soothing music/ listening to lectures, avoiding screens for 1, 2, 3 hours before bed, turning off lights for 2,3, 4 hours before bed, keeping the temperature down, sleeping with little on except socks, praying to God, literally everything.\n\nLiterally if it is in one of the myriad of \"How to get to sleep\" articles you see, I have tried it.\n\nA lot of them say \"go to sleep and wake up regularly\" But that is next to impossible as one has to fall asleep to wake up. \n\nThe results are spotty at best. It is not uncommon for me to go multiple days without sleeping at all. It is the most difficult thing I am going through. It is so hard for me to force myself away from two bottles of wine, or a fifth of vodka, or some beer. It will help me sleep, even if it is shitty sleep that isn't real, at least it is something. \n\nI feel like this is pittance for my sins of drinking, but honestly I am not sure how much more I can take. I will keep pushing forward and hopefully this will clear up sometime. I keep telling myself it has to. The need for sleep has to be stronger than insomnia right? \n\nRight? \n\n I know I'm not alone in this. But, I won't drink with you today. ",

If I do it will most likely be S . Things arent going so well right now. I feel scared because Im not doing enough to ensure my future. Thats how I feel at least.  Today I didnt go to S's house after the dinner because I had to \"clean my room\". All I did was lay in bed the past 7 hours not doing anything. I guess ive been trying to sleep but I just cant. Two weeks ago I started having these feelings of worthlessness again and I dont know how to fix it. I feel myself getting drained mentally and physically. Things that are normally easy, like being around people and conversating with family, are becoming harder and harder to do and all I want to do is lay down and go to sleep. I dont want to wake up in the mornings. I dont want to start my days anymore. I just want to lay there and dissolve into nothing\\-ness. Im afraid too. My anxiety has gotten worse and worse to the point of me having to fight it back just being outside of my house. I feel people staring at me when im walking about, or biking down the road. I feel lesser because I dont have my license and im 20. I feel like people judge me and think im lazy for not getting my license but driving isnt fun for me. I dont enjoy it and I just flat out dont want to drive. I still have a lot of hang ups on my appearance too. Even though ive lost so much weight, Ive still got so much to lose. Im still fat and Ive been going to the gym for months at this point with no physical changes. Ive still got man tits and ive still got a fat gut and ive still got fat legs and a double chin with no muscle on my frame at all. I feel like shes going to leave me if i dont fix this mess. Im anxious about my home life. lately people have been saying that my dad is an alcoholic and it really hurts me. I love my family alot but when im over with them and they talk about my dad like hes just some guy that drinks it hurts. It makes me cry at nightime because it hurts so much. I dont know why anyone would be so rude to him. Hes nothing but caring and kind and he loves me with all his heart and they just shut him down. My uncle is a loud obnoxious prick. He was interrogating my dad about his truck and asking him if it was really fancy and my dad kept saying no its just a basic model and it was almost like he was making fun of him and I wanted to just fucking hit him so bad. I hate him. Hes been nothing but loud and inappropriate the whole night. I love my dad and it kills me to hear that these people who are supposed to be loving him are talking like that behind his back... I dont know what to do about it though im still young and i dont want people to be upset with me. you know, i say i dont want people to be upset with me but then i do stupid shit. i didnt go see S because im not feeling well and i couldnt even tell her. Shes the one person im supposed to be 100&amp;#37; honest with and im too scared to tell her that i want to die because i know how itll effect her. I have no future. I dont have the grades to do anything after university and i dont have a plan at all. Im just wasting time and money and im not going to have anything to show for it after im done these four years of my life. my dad is going to resent me for not doing well in school and im going to have to deal with not being good enough for anyone again. i dont know what to do\n\ni guess its just another one of those days.\n\n\\-Just a journal entry from today. not doing well\\-",

Eventually he asked if I ever felt like I self medicated with alcohol to handle the stress of the job. I answered yes. And he seemed uneasy about my answer. He told me that it was concerning but he\u2019d finish my investigation and turn in his findings to my employer.

It's not even *close* to be being at the root of the issue that my loved one has. \n\nHaving her sober has demonstrated this powerfully - she got stuck around step 3 and has been continuing as a dry drunk for a couple of years, still slipping in and out of her fantasy world where so long as the grown-ups don't find out, she can do all sorts of things (spending money we don't have, and engaging in fantasy relationships are the two I've been having most fun with). \n\nAlcohol may have been a pair of training wheels on this bike.

   "selftext": "I was seeing a guy for about a month. Things turned really sour when he became very irritable with me and would get into moods where he would become quite insensitive. This obviously triggered me and he went on to say that he is a 'jerk' and is going to get '100 percent jerkier' and if I want to continue dating him, I have to be ok with this. He expressed that he needs to be with a girl who will put him back in his place when he acts like this and because he has a drinking problem, he is likely to get meaner after drinking. This is not the relationship that I am after, especially having BPD, so we both agreed to end it there.\n\n\n\nIt was a terrible decision, but we agreed to stay friends with one another and communicated via Facebook messenger. We'd get into this routine where we'd chat like we used to before we got romantically involved, then one of us would confess to each other that we still had feelings for each other, we'd both agree that we found talking was making it difficult and to give each other some space until we were ok to talk again. After that agreement, I would get these overwhelming impulses to contact him and talk to him because it felt that when we took that time apart, my feelings for him grew stronger and became really intense. I'd have this overpowering need to speak to him and I'd break the agreement and  cave in. I would then realise that it was best to give it time, I'd apologise and back off. This cycle went on for about a month and each of these discussions were spaced around a week to two weeks apart. During every one of these discussions he continued to speak me to me like usual and he quite willingly engaged with me. He even told me that I can break the contact rule at any time if I was in a bad place and needed someone to talk to because he still 'really cares' for me.\n\n\n\nAfter the last agreement for no contact, I caved in and got in touch to tell him that I really wish we were able to make it work and that I was struggling to move on. He responded saying that he feels exactly the same and that something deep down makes him want to say, 'stuff it lets just be together', but he knows deep down because of his alcoholism, it would be catastrophic for both of us. Two days passed with no discussion between us and I continued the conversation. He said that he was just drunk when he wrote that stuff to me, he doesn't even remember saying things about still having feelings for me as they are no longer there for him anymore.  I tried to engage further and he ignored my messages, which set me off to ask him if he was ignoring me.\n\n\n\nAfter two days, I wrote in to apologise for bombarding him with those messages and he told me that he is done talking with me now and doesn't want to have anything to do with me anymore because I keep getting in touch, I keep asking the same questions and it keeps going around in circles and he just wants to have some peace. He said that he has told me time and time again not to communicate with him (however he never once did express this), he has tried to be polite and has tried to respond to my messages but now he wants to cut off all contact for good. I apologised profusely to him as I felt terrible for misreading the situation and overstepping his boundaries. I felt so ashamed by this and begged him not to end it on such sour terms and he told me that it's the only way and he can't help how I feel. I asked him if this is really what he wants and he said 'there is another question, I told you to stop communicating with me, yet you still keep going'. I then expressed that I will respect his decision to stop interacting and apologised for all of this.  He read my last message, ignored it and then deleted me off all social media.\n\n\n\n\nI have been struggling to cope within the last few days since this happened as I am filled with these immense feelings of worthlessness and shame for being such a nuisance to him and behaving in a way that was disrespectful to his boundaries. I am also filled with a lot of anxiety and feel this will cause me social isolation as he hangs out in a big social crowd that I can't really avoid when I go out and I am concerned he will talk about me and tell people how annoying and unstable I am,etc and that people will judge me for it.\n\n\nDoes anyone have any insights as to how I can help get myself up from here?",

I have a bunch of issues, I'm bipolar, I'm a recovering addict/alcoholic, I have non epileptic seizures and I'm just generally messed up. Piece by piece I've been putting my life back together. But I don't believe I am healthy enough yet to share myself with someone else. \n\nI stopped self harming a couple of years ago, after one of my attempts at ending my life I said I would never do it again unless I made sure i was going to die if I did. I'm trying to word this in the least emotional way possible cause it's hard to think about. I had been abandoned by everyone around me, part of that was because of who I had become but part of it was also that I surrounded myself by people who betrayed my trust and hurt me over and over so I cut an \"X\" over my heart and told myself I would protect myself by not letting anyone into my heart until the scar had faded, turns out it is permanent. \n\nSo I'm sitting here thinking about the relationship thing and wondering how I would deal with someone seeing the scar. Or any of the others really, I am afraid to wear shorts or t-shirts. The rational healthy part of me acknowledges that it was a silly thing to do but all of a sudden there was this other voice of mine that out of nowhere said \"but the relief felt good. I miss it.\" This seems to happen whenever I think about it or look at my scars, as painful as that time in my life was the part of me that is attracted to that way of dealing with things is still there. \n\nI am safe, I am not even in a low mood which makes it even weirder to have a thought like that. It has upset me but not to a worrying degree. \n\nJust figured I would see if there was a place I could express this and maybe see if anyone else has had similar experiences. Does it ever go away or is it just something I will have to manage alongside my bipolar, anxiety, seizures and recovery.

I'am from different country came to Ireland to study IT and try to find better life, because there is no future in my home country.

Nofap made me look differently to my life and it made me realize that shit happens to people if they want it or dont. For me I life with my house mates they are all 10 years older than me and you know more experienced in life. They often tease me that I'am to young to understand many things I'm still a child compared what they went throught. For example one of them \\(one of the roomates\\) was a drug addict he got stabbed for owning money, other goes to prostitutes and last one is alcoholic. But they are not the mean type but more like everything what they do is normal type. Once there was a party at our house I met other my nation people they were a couple but they often fight and curse at each other. I sat down and asked the women why do you keep fighting like this and still be with him and the answer didnt shock me but made me less be happier about life overall what she say'd was '' We need everything in our lifes it would be boring for me if we would not do drugs drink alcohol or fight, it would be awfully boring living a peaceful life''. Being a person what was raised in very peaceful family with no alcoholism no fight only love and strict rules.

Nevertheless, may your own conscience guide you: perhaps God will use this to bless you as well.\n\nI'm going to try to keep this short and sweet (though I probably won't), intending to wrap this post up by sharing the *one* happening that encapsulates and symbolizes everything that freedom from lust has wrought within me.\n\nAlthough the ultimate reason that I practice NoFap (or, as I also call it, chastity) is to obey and grow closer to Christ, the subsidiary motivations of (1) rewiring my brain to achieve sexual *normality* and (2) healing my PIED are also powerful, powerful motivations.\n\nBy the grace of God, I have enjoyed freedom from lust\u2014in all of its forms\u2014for 94 days and counting. I don't even let my eyes rest on a female form: why shave fiery sparks onto a pile of very, very dry wood? Should God ever bless me with a wife, then I will rest my eyes on her and her alone.\n\nI am 37 years old, and my long addiction to lust had warped and bent me inside: I used to look at things that now make me shudder. I felt so *filthy*, but that filthiness and twisting of everything that was good and pure in this world was precisely the *tang* that I craved. I had no normal sexual desires and no normal libido.\n\nI am also an alcoholic. I drank for sixteen years, and I have now been sober for 20 months and counting\u2014rehab, AA, the whole nine yards. AA saved my life.\n\nThose two addictions fed off of each other and amplified one another for *years*, and in that swamp of isolated, lonely drinking, I looked at oceans of porn, and the warping and twisting and bending and sexual leprosy just metastasized within me.\n\nThroughout sobriety, I have always struggled against lust, trying to extend my recovery into that area. But, and I'm sure that most of you can relate, I would always go three or four weeks and fail. Porn became my \"new\" alcohol: when my coping mechanisms were overwhelmed, I would go on a three- or four-day porn \"bender.\"\n\nIn my experience, addiction to lust, like addiction to alcohol, is progressive. Even physical sobriety and the weeks of seeking God didn't change my sexual tastes one iota. Once I indulged, it was back to the pigpen of anti-natural, \"taboo,\" filthy, insectoid cravings.\n\nBy the grace of God, I now have freedom: though I remain vigilant.\n\nFor most of this period, I honestly wondered whether my manhood would ever work again. It was just lifeless.\n\nRecently, I met a Christian girl. Last weekend was the best weekend of my life: it was downright enchanting, and I never knew that such synergy and intimacy could exist between a man and a woman. Honestly, it was *magical*. I didn't know such a thing was even possible. And best of all, it felt *clean*. I felt *clean* and *pure* and *wholesome*, and that was **exactly** what I desperately panted after when I started this journey.\n\nAll of that to say, my emotions were overflowing, and when I went to merely hold her hand, my manhood came to life. It surprised me . . . and actually made me embarrassed: I was craving for purity *coram Deo* and was desperately worried that she would notice.\n\nBut the *best* thing about it was that *it wasn't the handholding that caused the rush of blood*: it was the **emotional contact**.\n\nI am so grateful to God that I could almost cry just thinking about it. To me, *that* is what the sex drive was meant to be, or, at least, that is its highest function. I am not degrading physical intimacy\u2014within its proper, God-ordained boundaries: I am no body-abhorring gnostic.\n\nBut I cannot tell you how incredibly grateful I was that *clean feelings of intimacy towards a girl that I care about* activated my libido.\n\nIt's the gift beyond gifts, and I wouldn't trade it for all of the filthy lust spasms in the world.\n\nAnd had I \"tested\" to see whether my PIED was cured by dipping into the pigpen, all of that snow-white purity would have been tainted.\n\nI'm rambling.

   "selftext": "So, I had a particularly bad (in my opinion, maybe you all will disagree) experience with trying to find a counselor to talk about my issues with drinking this weekend. A little background: I\u2019ve posted in here and on /cutdowndrinking before. I have a problem with drinking too much white wine during the month - I.e. can\u2019t stop after one or two. I also have occasional black outs because of this. I don\u2019t drink alone or during the week. Regardless of all that, I know this is not healthy, it scares me at times, and I want to take steps to change that/stop completely. I saw a counselor yesterday in hopes of starting that process. She began our appt asking me why I was there and I said something to the effect of \u201cwell I have trouble with moderation and drinking too much, at times to the point of blacking out.\u201d And she cut me off immediately with \u201cso you\u2019re an alcoholic.\u201d I was pretty taken aback that she felt confident in diagnosing me after I gave her maybe three sentences-worth of information. I tried to rebut with \u201cwell, I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s what I am. I just know I have a problem with drinking and want to fix that.\u201d And she came back with \u201cwell one of the definitions of an alcoholic is that you can\u2019t stop once you start. A lot of times it\u2019s just in your genes. That\u2019s all.\u201d I went on to say how the label stigmatizes people and (I\u2019ve read some Annie grace before) that while you can quit something like cigarettes without the raising of an eyebrow, you get labeled (like she labeled me) an alcoholic when you say you don\u2019t drink. She didn\u2019t really seem to comprehend that this was anything to really be concerned about because she then said \u201cwell you don\u2019t have to tell people you\u2019re an alcoholic, you just say it doesn\u2019t make you feel good.\u201d The appointment basically went down hill from there (she also asked me if I was religious and when I said no, told me I need to think about something because kids need religion. I don\u2019t have kids yet.) I guess I\u2019m just more venting and wondering if there are better therapists out there. Or, am I being too sensitive? Sorry for long post. ",

At 30 days sober I went to the doctor and got bloodwork but they said everything was normal including thyroid. \n\nHowever, I am struggling with some symptoms that I believe may be related to hypothyroidism. My body temperature is always 97.6 instead of the typical 98.6 and I am always cold. If I drink cold water I have to get in the shower to heat up! My eyebrows are thinning around the edges and I have melsasma/hyperpigmentation and rosacea. My skin is dry, I can't stay hydrated no matter how much water I drink, and my eyes are always red. I've always struggled with energy and have IBS. \n\nEven when I was drinking I was otherwise super health-conscious. My diet and exercise routines are good. I attributed these symptoms to drinking/not taking care of myself but now that they are not going away I am wondering if I should get a second opinion.\n\nNot looking for medical advice, just wondering if anyone else has been through this or similar issues (hormone imbalance) after quitting and if things ever got better!

   "selftext": "Hi everyone. I apologize in advance if I ramble a bit, but I've made the decision to quit and want to get all my thoughts out there and get some advice from those of you who've done it already.\n\nI took Kratom for the first time last August. So less than a year ago. While I DO consider myself to have a somewhat addictive personality, I have no history of opioid abuse/addiciton or anything like that. I drink alcohol occasionally, but have no issues with abuse or alcoholism. I started pretty slowly and experienced all the positive benefits we probably all associate with Kratom. As I'm sure is typical, I slowly started to use it more and more often and at slightly higher doses. Truthfully I didn't do the proper research or read about any possible negative long-term effects, so in my mind I was totally fine taking it as often as I wanted. It got rid of any desire to drink alcohol, which I perceived as another positive and more reason to continue.\n\nAround February, I decided I needed to take a month off to prove to myself that I wasn't addicted. I quit CT for about 27 days in February-March. I experienced extremely low energy and a lot of fatigue, but I was also on a calorie restricted diet at the time and working out more than usual, so I chalked my low energy levels up to that. At the time, I didn't even CONSIDER that this may be due to the Kratom withdrawal. After the 27 days, I slowly started to take small doses again, which then led back to the daily use at higher doses. A couple weeks ago, I started getting random runny noses which I found really odd. I decided I needed to take another break to prove to myself that I could do it, if I wanted to. Towards the beginning of May, I quit CT for about 10-11 days. The low energy/lethargy was MUCH worse this time around, and this time it was made even worse because I KNEW it was from the withdrawal. I have a very rigid workout routine, so I train every single day. I always work out in the morning, and get through my workouts just fine with high energy, but about an hour after I'm done training, the low energy hits very hard and sticks with me the rest of the day. I've also started experiencing depression symptoms, which I've NEVER had issues with in my life. High anxiety and bad depression which have been the absolute worst part of the withdrawal. I can deal with the low energy, but the depression is so new to me and I can't allow myself to go through it. I have two daughters and a wife, so it's fucking humiliating to me that I have had to come to terms with the fact that I got addicted to this stuff that I didn't even know existed less than a year ago.\n\nAfter my last 10 day quit, I tried to slowly pulse in low doses again with days off in between. It worked for a couple days, until, of course, the same thing happened again and I started dosing every day. That leads up to today. I woke up with crippling anxiety and a terrible depressed mood this morning. I'm at the point where I know, without question, that I need to quit for good. This is where I am hoping to get some advice or tips. Based on my rambling story, do you guys think quitting CT again (for good) is my best option? I just hate the anticipation of how bad the depression/anxiety/low energy is going to be. But I also don't want to taper and draw this stuff out any longer than I have to.\n\nIn your experiences, how quickly do you think the mental issues go away once you quit CT? And have any of you had any luck with any natural remedies to help with the low energy and depressive mood? I'm 100% ready and committed to being done, but I'd like to take the smartest route possible. \n\nFor reference, my usual daily intake is probably 10-12G. Some days it was more, some days it was less... but I never really got to the point where I was taking 50-60G per day like I've seen some people do. Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read!",

   "selftext": "I'm new to this, so if i've posted to the wrong thread please point me in the right direction, thank you. \n\nI lived in an emotionally traumatic household my entire childhood (around 17 years), leaving me with severe depression and anxiety. To keep it short, I had an alcoholic father, a mother who was gone on business most weeks and wouldn't believe me or take action when i told her my father was mistreating me, and a brother who would lie to school counselors to defend my father when I spoke out about it. I struggled all throughout elementary, middle, and high school, having no motivation to do well and had difficulty staying focused. \n\nThe emotional abuse I went through left me very socially awkward and incredibly sensitive. I found ways of coping through social media sites and video games, and made very little friends at school, and am now left with none outside of the internet since moving states. I had no reason to leave the house because I had no friends who would invite me to go out with them, so I never did. \n\nI am now 20, living with my parents and have had no job experience whatsoever. I've applied to jobs but no one has ever hired me. The one time I was, the job was far too much pressure than I had thought it would be, and I embarrassingly bailed without a word. Most jobs i look into seem like too much pressure, Like i wouldn't be able to do any of them, no matter how simple they may be. \n\nI am prescribed zoloft (50mg) by my doctor, and it helps with the anxiety (without it I have daily panic attacks at seemingly random) but I still suffer from depressive episodes. Mainly having very little interest in things or being motivated. Most days I'd rather stay in my room rotting away rather than make a life for myself. It's rare that I leave the house more than once a week.\n\nI do want to move out, have a job and make friends, just something relatively normal rather than what I do now, but i feel hopeless, and most of the time i give up on that thought and just accept that I'll be the loser living in his parents basement his whole life. Is there any suggestions to kick start my hopelessness and gain control of my life and work towards being an adult? Do I need to up my prescription, or possibly try something new? I'm very against the idea of therapy but if enough people think I need it I will give it a try. I'm open to just about any suggestion, as I would very much like the help. Thank you.",

   "selftext": "Happy Memorial Day weekend fellow soberites.  I try to post or reply here to someone daily because I know first hand how helpful this SR is so thank you all for reading and contributing to the community.  One thing has me concerned at this point in my sobriety: am I setting myself up for failure?\n\nMy \u201cquitting\u201d story is on this SR so I won\u2019t bore with the details. Essentially, I hit a personal rock bottom March 1st and said enough is enough \u201cI\u2019m done\u201d. Forever. Felt like someone died the next day emotionally.  Nothing happened per se, but I felt like had I not quit, something irrevocably tragic would happen. Felt it in my bones. So here I am today. \n\nThe problem or concern is, for me, now that the first 60 days are behind me, I don\u2019t feel the urges and cravings others here experience.  I feel completely in control and free. I feel confident and secure. I have been to the liquor store and restaurants where alcohol is the focus. I have attended get-togethers centered around adults drinking. I feel it in myself that I am an alcoholic just like them. Only difference is I don\u2019t drink. Never again. \n\nSo here is my question: do people relapse and battle for months and years because they haven\u2019t fully committed or something else?  For me, I believe, now, that taking a drink is as simple as choosing to imbibe any other liquid by it\u2019s just a choice. Just like the choice I make every day to not drink. I know booze will ruin me and gives nothing back if not some \u201cfun\u201d around others that may or may not remember the \u201cfun\u201d or care either way. \n\nJust curious if I\u2019m overconfident in someone\u2019s eyes or if a dedicated and deliberate effort to choose never to drink again is a benchmark of long term success. I hope so: it\u2019s all the power I have over alcohol. ",

His dad beat him, his parents got divorced, his mom is an alcoholic, brother is a crackhead, sister is never home, etc etc. Well for a while now I\u2019ve known of his drug habits. He smokes cigs, drinks, smokes weed, and the sorts. He has also been diagnosed with several mental disorders ranging from severe anger issues, ptsd, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, mood swings, and a few others (I can\u2019t remember). I should also mention we\u2019re in high school. He\u2019s always been pretty bad with regulating day to day behavior, but as of lately it\u2019s gotten much worse. His girlfriend of 11 months broke up with him and he didn\u2019t handle it well. I tried explaining high school relationships don\u2019t mean much, but he won\u2019t listen. He\u2019s began to snort adderall  and going to any random party to get high/drunk.

To deal with this, he drinks and has told me that previously he would drink 12 beers a night just to be able to fall asleep. \n\nHe went to a large party school for college where he would drink to the point of blacking out every weekend and would drink everyday. I guess his friends acted as a crutch for him and would make sure he got home and in bed because he would lose all mental and motor function. We went to visit his college last fall for a football game and his friends all met us there, and he got drink to the point where he blacked out and cheated (made out with another girl), with no memory of the incident. \n\nIronically, he and I both found out the night before we were moving in together so for that and other reasons I made the decision to move in anyway (although in hindsight maybe it was a sign) and work on the relationship. I black out that night as well (very rare for me) and since I have never gotten that drunk again, out of pride and shame in the incident and that I was too inebriated to know myself. \n\nFast forward, my boyfriend still gets drunk and drinks every day. It ranges from 3 to up to as much as 16-17 beers a day (like today) and still blacks out here and there, though not as often as before. It makes me very bitter that this sort of drinking nearly cost our relationship and hurt me emotionally but it is not enough to not binge drink or at least to set limits or not black out ever again. I have brought it up that he should cut back his drinking and even that it makes me nervous that he can get that drunk (due to the infidelity) and he doesn't take it well. His tolerance is really high so he can walk and such, but I know he relies on it to relax and sometimes to sleep so I know he has a problem. I have not given him an ultimatum because I personally think there are healthier ways to get the same outcome, but I know I need to make myself more clear. \n\nHow can I communicate to him that this must change without sounding like the bad guy?

That would have been last May. I started noticing some red flags late January this year.\nWe both drank a lot; on the weekends, at new work parties, over wedding planning.

Among other things. This past year he's been admitted to the hospital on three occasions for pancreatitis, a blood transfusion due to low hemoglobin and GI bleeding/hemorrhoids/leisons on stomach. As well as probably at least 100 trips to the emergency room in 5 years for various ailments.\n\n Each time I go I adamantly  mention alcohol consumption but he downplays it with the doctors.

The idea of forever not only makes not drinking far too intimidating but I end up railing against the idea and going *hard*, only to wake up feeling shitty again. \n\nI have a new job that I love, and we have an insane week coming up. I want to be clear-headed and full of energy for it, but I can always convince myself that I'll have just one beer and it wont affect me much. As you all probably know, that is never how it plays out after the first drink. \n\nI want to quit for the following week, at the very least, and take it from there. I'm not certain that I can even stick to that, but I think posting here will definitely help strengthen my resolve. \n\nI've also bought a supplement that aids in detoxifying the system (Chlorella).

   "selftext": "I become easily hurt when mental health professionals tell me that I \"need to try harder\". What does that even mean? That phrase has lost all meaning to me. Haven't I tried \"enough\"? \n\nI have been receiving mental health services on and off for going on 11 years. I have been on around 30 different meds, receiving therapy for the better part of 5 years, numerous inpatient stays, in residential services with a day program for 3ish years and have had ECT. I think I've put a lot of effort into my recovery, dare I say more than a lot of people in my situation. \n\nYet, it has all been in vain. \n\nI have never been \"functional\". The longest I've ever worked is 2 weeks and it was a struggle. I have only lived on my own once and it was awful. I don't think I'd be able to again, my paranoia is so bad. When I was living with my ex and he'd go to jail, or rehab, being alone in our house was overwhelming. Every single night I would have a panic attack thinking someone would break in to the point where I started hallucinating that there was someone else in my house. I could hear doors opening, foot steps etc. Every day as it began to get late and start turning dark, I would be petrified. I slept with a big ass knife. \n\nI even became afraid of going out by myself. It didn't help that our neighborhood was not good and by that I mean attendants at gas stations would be behind bulletproof glass. Shootings were an often occurence. A few restaurants in the area accepted foodstamps, no hate though, it was nice to be able to get a calzone, or fried chicken with my stampies. The point is, it was an impoverished neighborhood with a lot of crime and drug activity, which again, was nice to have people selling me weed and Xanax on a trip to the liqour store.\n\nBut even now, that paranoia, that anxiety, has followed me. I live out in the country and I would not feel safe if I didn't live with my parents. I don't like going places by myself. Of course, I have to muster up the courage on a near daily basis to make my trek to the liqour store and even then, such minimal human interaction, leaves me feeling frazzled. I worry, pointlessly, about what they must think of me. \n\n\"She's an alcoholic, she's weird, she dresses weird, her hair is stupid, her eyebrows are fucked up, we're in Florida why is this bitch so pale, she's ugly and too thicc, what a FUCKING FREAK\". \ud83d\ude27\n\nI used to panic, but now I don't know, it's like the anxiety is just a part of me now, it integrated with my personality. Same with depression. This is just my life now. I've accepted it. A person can only be knocked down so many times before they realize the ground is comfortable and not get back up anymore. \n\nThis is how I feel. \n\nIt's not like I haven't *been trying*, it's just nothing has fucking worked and I feel lower than I have ever felt, except it's not a \"depressive episode\" anymore. *Oh no*. I have transcended depression.\n\nI read about this species of parasite, this could be completely science fiction because my brain is fried like rice, but they infect the host and actually take control. \n\nIt's like that.\n\nDepression, anxiety and paranoia used to be like ticks. They fed on my essence, but could have been combatted at one point. Now it's like that parasite has control of my brain and to kill it would be to kill me at this point. Completely inseparable.\n\nI honestly don't think there is any coming back from this, no matter how hard I try. Can't run a marathon with 2 broken legs, you know.\n\nI just get so sick when people insinuate that if you try at something hard and long enough, you will be successful. That's utter bullshit. That's the American dream though, right? Poor people are just lazy quitters etc. The fact is, that you can put your all into something and still fucking fail.\n\nDo you think all of those people who audition for American Idol and other talent competitions go on to be platinum recording artists? *Of course not*. The simple fact of the matter is that some people do fail. Miserably. \n\nI had an AA sponsor tell me that, \"not everyone gets a chance to recover\". It kind of upset me at the time, because I was doing all of the right things, putting in so much work, certainly I would be successful?!\n\n*Fuck* no.\n\nI'm fucking sick of it, honestly. Sick people can get better, but that doesn't mean every single fucking sick person will make a full recovery. That's ludicrous. Imagine having cancer and an oncologist telling you that if you \"try hard enough\" you'll be cured! \n\nThat would be fucking cruel, unheard of.\n\nSo let's just stop, okay? Stop trying to convince me that if I delude myself, despite evidence to the contrary, that everything will be okay! NO. Fuck off.",

   "selftext": "Throwaway, New to posting, On mobile, sorry for format. \n\nBackground: My mom grew up wealthy but chose a life of drugs abusive men instead. When she learned she was pregnant with me (6-7/months along), she supposedly quit meth for good. She was an alcoholic all of my life. \n\n20 yrs ago she was diagnosed with Hepatitis C, a disease affecting the liver, yet continued to drink and smoke cigarettes. \n\nWhen drinking, she was EXTREMELY unstable and abusive. When sober, shes like a mildly crabby old lady but nothing like her drunk self. But she drank almost every single night of my life. \n\nShe\u2019s been kicking me out of the house since I was 10. Once I turned 18 I had the police help me collect my stuff and told her to kick rocks. She hasn\u2019t laid a hand on me since. \n\nI didn\u2019t talk to her for years though when she did reach out, I would have contact with her only when she was sober. My sisters would have inflammatory on and off relationships with her. \n\nHer liver has been suffering since the 80s and already had cirrhosis. Then they discovered cancer as well. \n\nShe quit drinking, quit her job and lost her apartment, due to how ill she was. \n\nI offered her a piece of my liver many many times. (It grows back!) she said no. Eventually she started hinting she wanted me to offer my liver again. My grandpa called me right before he died guilting me into giving it to her. I was struggling so much with my health and would lose my job that I didn\u2019t feel like the surgery was the right thing for me and I did not offer again. \n\nThrough a LOT of hard work, on her part and her doctors\u2019, she was sent across the country to receive a liver transplant. Surgery happened 4 months early because she was basically dead and she eventually made it home healthy! \n\nHer best friend of 50 years helped so much in the process and stayed in the other state with her while she healed and moved in with her here to continue helping. \n\nThat was around the new year. Now, she has a relationship with 2/4 daughters (including me) and her granddaughter(my niece). Which after all she\u2019s done, is very lucky for her. (I am her only family living in state) \n\nI recently had to leave my ex because of his drug use and temper (yay!) and she offered to have me stay which is the first time I\u2019ve stayed with her in 6 years. \n\nHonestly it\u2019s been pretty good for a week. She doesn\u2019t remember most of the awful stuff she\u2019s done and i don\u2019t see the point in rubbing it in her face. But it\u2019s been nice talking and making good memories together. And I absolutely love her best friend who I call an aunt. Especially after everything she did for my mom this last year. \n\nThen last night mom came home drunk and reeking of cigarettes. Her attitude was so nasty, it brought back so many gross feelings.\n\nI had a huge panic attack. If she tried to get violent with me now, I could handle it. I was just so disappointed. She was never going to be the mom I wanted but I really wanted to give her the chance to be a mom to me.\n\nAnd her best friend is receiving the brunt. My mom just treats her like an annoying authority figure and acts so judged when it\u2019s fucking normal to be upset! It\u2019s offensive to her friend, the liver donor, and all the sick people that didn\u2019t get a liver. \n\nI told her how I felt this morning and that I had a panic attack and was worried about her. She said she slipped and \u201cit\u2019s not like I\u2019m gonna drink every night again\u201d and I\u2019m afraid she doesn\u2019t even realize the quantity wasn\u2019t the problem, her behavior when she drinks is.\n\nShe\u2019s stressed out because her social security is ending soon and she has to go back to work. We are in the middle of nowhere which has cheap rent for an older lady but nowhere offers above minimum wage which is not enough to cover her minimal bills. Not an excuse but stress does that to addicts. \n\nSo on one hand, I want to look after my mental health. On the other hand I know my mom has been through many traumatizing things in her life and I want to give her understanding and love so that she can get better. I don\u2019t want her to throw away her chance to have a real life again. \n\nTLDR: Alcoholic, abusive mom sobered up and got new liver. I just moved in with her. She drank and smoked cigarettes last night. Boooooo\n\n\n\n",

   "selftext": "Could do with some advice on how to handle this situation....\n\nSo I have suffered with social anxiety for a long time. For the last couple of years of my alcoholism, I have barely seen anyone. I'm used to being on my own, being very independent and doing my own thing.\n\nHaving started attending AA this week, I've met some people who I consider I get along with, but I wouldn't call them 'friends', they're very different to me, but we have bonded over our respective addictions. Anyway, a couple of these people got wind that i have a car, and now they keep asking me for lifts to and from every meeting. Its absolutely sending my anxiety through the roof because I HATE having people rely on me! The odd lift if they're stuck is ok, but even within the space of a week it seems to have become a given! It's making me angry as I think 'well I've only been at AA a week, and you managed before I came along!'. Also, there's the cost aspect. One of the girls was telling me how much she usually spends on taxi's, yet hasn't given me any money! I'm absolutely skint at the moment, and I can barely afford to run my car as it is, let alone ferry everyone else around from different locations in the process.\n\nIt's my car, and my money running it, and it was a major step for me to walk into AA and if I'm going to be taken advantage of like this, then it's making me not even want to go to AA. I am going to AA for ME! To help myself recover from alcoholism, not to be a taxi service. I feel like crying. It's my first week, it's fucking hard, and you'd think they would remember how it feels and not put any additional pressure on me. I hardly know these people, if I wanted to give them a lift I'd offer. It's making me want to crawl back into my shell and say fuck it to AA. Any advice on what to say to get them to back off would be welcome IWNDWYT.",

I live in a rented house with two roommates who don't respect me, one of them is an outright asshole to my face, both of them were good friends before we moved in together. Most of my close friends have drifted away because they started doing things I don't have an interest in, and I think they resent me for it. The friend I've had the longest I've known for 5 years and she's an alcoholic, and a frequent hard drug user, and I've started using also to have something else in common with her. Every time we hang out it's because she wants something from me, and we usually just drink and rail lines until my bag is empty. I usually don't even have a great time with her, but I've caught feelings and she's beautiful.\n\nI've been using for about 6 months and the addiction is there for sure. I don't even really like it all that much, but as soon as Friday hits the only thing I can think about is grabbing a bag. Stay up till the sun rises and sleep my Saturday away, feel like shit all day sunday, then drag my ass to work on Monday. Luckily it's not gotten me in financial troubles, and I'm telling myself that I won't let it get there, but then again I'm sure that's what every one says before it happens. \n\nI'm working about 60 hours a week, and I'm under paid by about 40%. I took over an account in February that was at 68% of goal, and the since I've taken over I've raised it to 94%. This customer makes our company a ton of money, our second largest customer, and our department head just restructured our bonus plan, and I'm getting royally screwed. I'm estimating about $1000 a month that I won't see because of this new plan.\n\nThe health insurance at my new company will be 100x better than the joke of a plan I have now, but my teeth are royally fucked and my mouth hurts all the time. My new insurance won't kick in for a few months after I start, it'll cover about 50% of the cost of the work I need done, but I'll probably still owe a few thousand that I don't have, and likely can't get a loan for because young me fucked my credit. Been working on that though. \n\nI will probably have to work until I die because all the money I get coming in, goes out to bills, food, and fun. I've never once had a 401k, but that will be changing with my new job, hopefully. I know how to fix this problem, but I never seem to actually do it. Maybe this time will be different, I say again. \n\nI'm an only child to a single parent household, I love my mom to death. She worked her as off to be able to live in a not so nice apartment in a well off city so I could have a quality education. Everything she did as I was growing up was to make sure I was going to be ok. She sacrificed so much of her life for me, and I appreciate it so fucking much, but I don't think she knows it. I live 20 miles away and I probably see her once every three months, talk to her about once a month. For some reason she annoys the hell out of me, and I just can't get past it. I'm an asshole. I also don't know what I'll do when she passes. I'm absolutely terrified about not having her here anymore. Luckily I think that's a long ways off. \n\nEvery day I fantasize about packing up everything I have, and moving halfway across the country. Start fresh. I'll never do it, and I know this, and that's why it sucks so bad. I know that moving away won't fix any problems I have, it'll just change where they're happening. But I so badly just want to leave. \n\nI really want to be a dad. I think I'd make a great parent. I think I'd make a great husband. I threw away an amazing relationship a few years ago because I'm an idiot, and now I feel like that ship has sailed. Who's in the market for a single guy, in their 30s, who wants to start a family?\n\nEven though I've got all this shit going on, I still like who I am. I think. I feel I have good morals, am intelligent, funny, and well liked by most everyone. But I still feel empty. I feel like I'm in Groundhog Day, only I'm getting older. Every day is the same as the last. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading.",

And I especially am uncomfortable with what feels like a lack of personal empowerment (I'm incapable and I can't do this without my higher power). \n\nBut I need more people in my life who are sober. And I have someone in my life who has begun challenging some of my preconceived notions about the program. And I've realized that alcohol took more of a role in my life when I no longer had other crutches that used to provide some comfort or escape.\n\nSo here I am, recognizing myself in other alcoholics' stories. Thinking that if there is some way that I can not be so afraid all the time and find some peace, that it might be worth working the steps. My sense of personal responsibility and need to be in control all the time (and not being willing to say I can't do it on my own) actually might be part of my disease. Just the thought of saying I don't have the answers and giving it all up to something greater than me fills me with huge amounts of anxiety.\n\nSo, despite all that I've overcome \"on my own\" (which has honestly made me more self centered) here I am ready to say that I'm ready to try something different. Something outside of me or bigger than me has certainly been working in my life to get me through some major life changes in the last 6 years, to bring me to this moment... Right when I was thinking I should be on top of the world, I couldn't figure out why I was still miserable.\n\nAt the very least, I don't think I have anything to lose by trying to work the program. But I'm really looking forward to giving up the reigns that I've held on to for dear life since childhood. \n\nI'm an alcoholic.",

It looked like fun but I had soda as a treat instead.\n\nSaturday was a lovely party with some relatively new friends. Kids were in the pool, parents were having a few beers in the sun. I was so happy to be drinking water. It was so hot and just looking at those beers made me feel dehydrated. \n\nOn Sunday the weather was terrible and we were all cranky from Friday and Saturday. My son pitched a fit on the front porch just as the church across the street was letting out. I\u2019m sure they think the devil himself lives here. By the time we got to our party I was cold and hungry and pretty much fed up with the entire thing. I went to put the seltzer with the other drinks and there was box of white wine. I am not usually a boxed wine kind of girl and even looking at it made me sick, anticipating the hangover. But it suddenly occurred to me that I could have a drink. I\u2019m an adult. I deserve a little escape. I started to tell our hostess, \u201cIt\u2019s been such a crappy day I think I might just have a drink.\u201d But half way through I realized what I was saying and I just shut my lips tight. I grabbed a water and immediately stuffed a brownie in my mouth. \n\nMaybe I will drink again one day. But it\u2019s not going to be nasty boxed wine and I won\u2019t be because I\u2019m having a bad day. That\u2019s what got me into this predicament in the first place. One bad day turns into years of bad days. The rest of the party was really fun and I had a nice bedtime read with my son instead of throwing him in bed so I could to get back to my drink. I slept well instead of waking up at 3am filled with remorse. And now I\u2019m ready for the next round of parties that I\u2019m sure today will bring.\n\nI won't drink with you today!",

The divorce happened last year but we have seen no change in his mood, there are still a lot of tears. It's as though he is going through a long grieving process, and I know that things can change over time, however he is not particularly active, has no friends and his ex wife was all he had in his life.\n\nWe are visiting as often as possible, but have recently noticed that he has been drinking a lot. He admitted that he had a problem, and would reguarly go to the shop in the morning for another drink. We want to help him, but being quite a solitary person, we have always struggled to get him out the house or doing anything outside of his comfort zone.\n\nWe know he has developed some health problems, high blood pressure as well as being diabetic, but upon finding  some information from his doctor that had not been filled out as it should, we are worried that he is going to get himself in to some serious difficulties. There is no motivation there to do anything except to sit in the house and drink and fall asleep on the sofa.\n\nHe is currently still working however, but would love to know if anyone has any experience in dealing with someone who has no support system outside of the small amount of family he has.

   "selftext": "I'm currently unemployed without any prior job experience, and my highest level of education is a high school diploma. My financial situation is quite tight, and while I can just barely pay the bills, disposable income is practically nonexistent. I attended college in the past, though I always ended up dropping out each semester due to being overwhelmed by my courses. I don't even want a career at this point: I just want a part\\-time job to give me a little more to spend or save on a rainy day. It's not like I plan on doing anything important with my life, so why waste my time in university only to work off my college debt for the majority of my life?\n\nI don't have any friends, and those that I considered my friends are off tending to their own lives while I'm slowly learning from past mistakes. I honestly don't really want friends, though I'm starting to see the results of leading a lonely life with minimal emotional support. It goes without saying that I don't have an intimate partner, though I can kind of live without one despite my occasional pining for such desires. I don't really know how to go about making friends or becoming more than friends, and it doesn't help that I'm painfully socially awkward and shy. I do find most people to be rather shallow and manipulative, so perhaps that's why I'm so reluctant to persue even platonic relationships.\n\nMy familial situation is strained, as I have my clingy biological mother and an emotionally abusive stepfather as the closest forms of parental units. My mom was an alcoholic, and my bio dad was a crackhead; she stopped when she was pregnant with me, but he still used throughout their marriage and recently quit. I'm kind of indifferent to my siblings, and can't develop an actual opinion of them. Life at home was terrible, and I resent my mother for putting up with my biological father's shit for the sake of having both parents in the household; not to mention that she didn't do anything to stop an older cousin from molesting me when I was seven, but I digress. Though my mother did get her shit together by getting her bachelor's degree, and while she was the lesser of two evils as a parent, she's still a childish and almost entitled brat; the less said about my old man, the better.\n\nSeveral aspects of my life are rather dismal at best, and absolutely abhorrent at its worst. While I'm certainly grateful for some of the strides I've made, I'm still feeling self\\-loathing and self\\-conscious about myself. I look at myself and think how disgusting and ugly I am; how I wish that I were physically attractive and sociable, or that I could find it within myself to know that there is so much to live for. I wish that I could have learned how to embrace my femininity, and taken the time to learn how to at least apply basic makeup or keep my hair neat. Instead, I just focused on studies and the internet; I couldn't have cared less about my disgusting facial acne and overweight body, as I was too depressed and self\\-absorbed to give a rat's ass.\n\nI had multiple suicide attempts, and I've taken so many medications to help mitigate the depression and anxiety. Therapy is helping me sort through my thought process and inner monologues, though I must admit that there are times where I do want to quit; be it from transference or simply feeling unmotivated. I stay at home practically every day, save for appointments or job development skills training. When I do go out, I just feel so self\\-conscious because I know I look like shit: it's almost as though I've grown accustomed to not putting much effort into my appearance, but I'm trying to break that habit for everyone's sake \\(including my own\\). Hygiene is pretty much appalling, but I at least do the bare minimum.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty dissatisfied with life. I don't know whether I want to die, or if I just want the pain to go away. I truly think that I would be better off dead; as I won't change anyone's life in a positive manner, and I certainly don't plan on doing anything of great societal significance. I'm just now starting to realize how horrendous I look and act compared to most women, who actually do give a shit about their outward appearance. I realize how terrible I feel as a result of letting myself go, and I hate myself for it all the more.\n\nSo, yeah. I just don't know what to do anymore. Advice, constructive criticism, brutal honesty; just help point me in the right direction, guys. I don't want to come across as having a pity party or turning this into a sob story: I just wanted to vent out my frustrations and gain outside help. Or rather, the opinions of total strangers on the internet. Any help is better than no help, I guess.",

   "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nI\u2019ve never posted on here, but I\u2019ve read through so many of these boards and this is one incredible, virtual support group. I guess I\u2019m turning to everyone on here for a little advice on how to cope with the loss of my brother who could not stop drinking.... \n\nAs the title of my post states, I lost my dear brother to an alcohol addiction this past week. This is a pain I\u2019ve never even come close to feeling and wouldn\u2019t wish upon my worst enemy. To see my parents whale in sorrow every night is a close second for things I never want to experience in my time on this planet. \n\nMy brother was an absolutely incredible person. He was handsome, a man serving others in his career and a source of laughter and happiness for our family. We noticed his addiction grow steadily worse over the past 8 years but we live in a small town where drinking is very prevalent. Also, alcoholism runs on both sides of the family so it\u2019s sort of something we are \u201cused to\u201d unfortunately. There\u2019s always that drunk Aunt or Uncle embarrassing themselves at family parties and no one thinks anything of it, because it\u2019s a generational disease that has plagued our family. I\u2019ve had my fair share of alcohol fueled embarrassments and run ins with the law that I\u2019m not proud of. I\u2019ve been in counseling for most of my life and have to make a conscious effort to stop drinking once I start. My brother on the other hand was on a completely different level. He used to drink a fifth a night of vodka straight and he didn\u2019t have that switch that said \u201cok, it\u2019s time to stop.\u201d I am not saying I\u2019m any better than him, my \u201con/off switch\u201d has definitely been broken many times but not to the level his was. \n\nWe\u2019ve confronted him and begged him to seek help for YEARS. All of our family functions, holidays, etc. have all centered around making sure he didn\u2019t have too much (or any) exposure to alcohol. My parents helped pay most of his bills so that his sole job was to spend all of his energy on fighting this disease. But nothing worked. \n\nWe thought he was in AA for the last 6 months and out of respect for his privacy, we decided not to pry into his progress. He would mention meetings or milestones here and there and we would balk at his success. I sent him countless cards, texts, voicemails filled with encouragement and pride for this demon he was facing head on. All the while, he had never really stopped and was still living this life of secrecy in his room. He would tell my parents how he hated being at restaurants because of all the drinking around him, but would then go right home and drink a fifth in his bedroom. When he was found dead this week by my poor father (who will never get that image out of his head), we were all dumbfounded. We thought he was getting better, we thought he was beating this! \n\nI can\u2019t quite come to grips with this loss and WHY it happened. Why didn\u2019t our words and actions help? Why was he powerless over this drug? Why didn\u2019t he reach out and tell us he fell off the wagon and needed help? Why do some people beat this and others don\u2019t? I\u2019m so lost and so heartbroken without him and I just can\u2019t help but keep asking myself WHY. \n\nAlso, for anyone struggling and your family is on your back, it\u2019s only because they love you more than anything and they want you here. They want you at every family function, they want you to meet their future children and attend their weddings. You are good enough, you are worth fighting for and your family is coming from a place of intense love. Please, I\u2019m begging you to listen \ud83d\udc97",

I have not gone more than a week at most (probably more like 3-4 days) without a drink in at least 4 years (since I turned 21). \n\nI didn't really start recognizing it as a problem until I graduated college, because in college, alcoholism just looks like being a typical student on the outside.

On stopping this endless cycle of admitting I have a problem but then just as soon convincing myself I don't? I want to stop drinking, but it's been such a big part of my life for so long and I just don't know where to start. (PS I'm sorry if this post is outside the rules for any reason, I haven't lurked this subreddit that long. Created a throwaway because my main is mostly about teaching and it would be bad if one of my students or coworkers found me talking about being an alcoholic).",

   "selftext": "One year ago, I met one of my friend's partners who was camping with us at Burning Flipside. She was five months sober, and this was her first sober burn. I had decided, once again, to attempt to moderate my drinking, so as not to suffer the ugly consequences of being a sloppy and careless person who drinks themselves stupid on the regular.\n\nOn the second day of the burn, she and I bonded over recently lost friends, and talked a bit about sobriety. She helped me tear down the myths I had built up around drinking, and showed me that there was nothing to fear or lose by giving up the bottle. I'd brought a 12 pack of beer and two bottles of liquor with me, and I didn't drink any more of it. When we went wandering around to different theme camps, I declined free drinks, and asked for something without alcohol. It was hard, I felt like I was missing out.\n\nThis year, 365 days later, it feels so much easier not to drink. I know how to have fun without alcohol, and it is so much more fun. Even after dancing and partying until late at night, I still wake up before everyone else in my camp and go to the temple of the steaming pot for coffee every morning. I even managed to organize a surprise ecstatic dance for a close friend who I love dearly. Could drunk me have done that? I don't think so.\n\n\"Does this have alcohol in it?\" is now something I ask often, and it flows more easily than the drinks ever did. I love going home to my burn, and I love my chosen family who have supported me more than I could have imagined.\n\nThank you so much, you've changed my life and helped me get closer to the person I am supposed to be. :)\n\nIWNDWYT",

   "selftext": "6-7 months ago, a friend told me in person that she was assaulted by a person in this friendship group, and that she was already discussing it with the police. I immedietely believed the girl, as I would with any girl who approached me with something as sensitive as this. My old friendship group immedietely turned on me for even believing her at all, for not immedietely accusing her of lying and going straight to the accused assaulter. They all tweeted that the girl was a liar, a psycho, an alcoholic and used a lot of sexist and derogatory terms for her, saying that the girl needs to wash herself with bleach and anyone who touches her needs to wash with bleach.\n\nI'm not sorry for standing by the girl through this. I got kicked out of the group for this. A group of some of my closest friends. Nobody talks to me anymore, I became a pariah. They started tweeting that anyone who associates with me should be culled. They found my old reddit account, which I then had to delete. Thanks to them I had to delete two twitter accounts due to the nasty abuse I was receiving. I sent none back. I kept quiet in the hopes it would eventually pay off, but the police have since dropped the case due to insufficient evidence, which to them confirms the girl was lying. \n\nMy issue is that it still hurts so much, that I still want them to not hate me and to accept me, even though I see the group for who they are. I lost a lot of friends at once. I'm hated and they're all still fine. ",

Still was barely lucid for a while after that. I went to the ER in an ambulance. They had me in a neck brace and put a trauma wristband on me.  I was in the trauma room first. They checked my ears, checked my pupils, felt up my neck for pain, did that test for weakness (push/pull) and they seemed to think all that was fine. So they stuck me in the hallway for 2 hours, gave me a zofran because I was nauseous (the taste of it nearly made me vomit on its own) and made sure I could eat/drink and walk and then sent me home. They performed no tests beyond any of this. I almost certainly have a concussion, it feels just like the last time. Unwilling to go to sleep (will go through any lengths to resist it. I know this isn't a normal symptom but it happened last time!), Mood swings from suicidal levels of depressed to i think elated is an accurate word.... And back and forth between those two.

I also can't remember much of anything that's happened since, unless I concentrate very hard and have been up for 28 hours. My neck is very stiff. They didn't do any CT scan and I've had those for far less. They seemed solely interested in getting rid of me asap because they were busy. They diagnosed me with \"head injury\" and told me to go to urgent care in a week. \n\nI was told to come here because I could have my life in danger right now? Since they barely looked at me and then kicked me out... I know I'm probably supposed to go back if I have a fever but they didn't tell me any reason to come back.

   "selftext": "I went to another AA meeting tonight and learned that 2 members of AA within the locality had sadly died over the weekend .\n\nWhile we all know the impact that alcohol can have in our daily lives, I think we all need to keep reminding ourselves that \"alcoholism is an incurable, progressive, fatal disease\".\n\nThe meetings I've attended this week have included share stories which  grounded all of us to the harsh realities of this illness. The truth is that as long as we continue to drink as alcoholics, we are slowly committing suicide. Fact. No if's, no buts, no maybe's. If we continue to drink to excess, it will kill us. By then, it wont matter that alcohol makes us act like dicks, or that it makes us late for work, or gets us chucked out the marital home \\- because we'll be dead. I don't want to die. I don't want my family to bury me because i drank myself to death. Life will always throw curve balls at us, but there is no problem on earth that a drink will solve. We can all do this. All we have to do is not pick up the first drink. It's that simple.\n\nI don't mean to bum everyone out, but it had quite an affect on me tonight and it made me think if we focus more on the health impacts of alcoholism rather than the day to day embarrassments and inconveniences, maybe the fear of death would keep more of us on track.\n\nChoose life, people.\n\nIWNDWYT",

I understand this doesn't have to be done for her sobriety. But if she can't have it, and she's only been alcohol free since receiving the scram bracelet 6 weeks ago, why should I be allowed to enjoy alcohol. \n\nI only drank 1-2 nights a week usually, and some nights that meant only 2-3 beers. A couple times a year I would have up to 12. \n\nI miss having that reward after a hard week of working, or a very productive day around the house or yard completing projects, building or fixing things. I miss having a few around the campfire, or having one before dinner so the food tastes better. I miss having a couple and seeing what new creative avenues my mind would find. \n\nI wish I knew what it was that caused that feeling about relief, after the kids were in bed and I would have that first reward beer that said, the day is complete, we did our job, everything is well. I've tried candy and desert, but that doesn't give me the same relief as having a beer did. \n\nAm I an alcoholic? That's definitely a question on my mind. In general I don't want for alcohol, and I really really love how connected my wife and I are right now since she hasn't been drinking and completed rehab. It did take a couple of weeks to get over looking for alcohol after the kids went to bed. This was a rough weekend since we were camping and I we never camped without drinking. Add on to that, the people we were camping with, decided not to participate with us at night, we also had someone else's child who it holy handful of trouble. And with how everything worked out the kids were going to bed so late this weekend it was too late for us to get a game out to play with each other. The cherry on top of this weekend was my mother, who's health has been rapidly declining the last 6 months, fell and ended up being life flighted from one hospital to another. She's fine now, but with her health and now dimentia I don't expect her to live until Christmas. So we ended our trip a night early. \n\nThat's my vent, I'm done. ",

He hides his drinking from me and thinks he's convincing but it's always obvious that he's drunk. Last year it got really bad. He's functioning but spent days drunk, urinated on the floor too many times to count, I found empty bottles hidden in the back of cabinets and stashed in the garage, he even started getting behind the wheel. Every week over and over we lived this pattern of behavior. I moved out for around 6 months or so after he drunkenly pulled out his gun one day. He swears he would never hurt me and only did it for attention and I believe him but that was a move too far. So we separated for a while and he swore he stopped and doesn't want to lose me. He had me convinced and we just moved back in together. Now he's sneaking drinking again. I have told him that I will support his sobriety and do whatever he needs of me to help and support him but if he continues to drink that I will have no choice but to leave him. We have been together for almost six years and I love him so walking away is not easy in any way. I keep forgiving and hoping but I'm coming to my wits end. As much as I love him, I do not like who he is when he is drunk. How do I know when to draw the line and walk away. How do I help him and save him and our relationship?",

Sometimes they will drink something else instead of beer, but very rarely, sometimes it's more than 6 pack, also rarely. Used to be 12-pack 10 years ago, but decreased. Sometimes after consuming the beer this person doesn't even get drunk, sometimes gets really annoying and pissy and sometimes just succumbs to a deep drunken sleep... sometimes (extremely rarely) on the floor. No hangovers ever. Says \"I am not an alcoholic\". Admits that can't and won's stop. Not violent or aggressive in any way.

   "selftext": "I got a coin and everything. \n\nThis is a drastic change from the first time I went sober where I only went to a handful of meetings before I dropped out thinking it wasn't for me. Which isn't to say I didn't stay sober, I just didn't think I was an alcoholic. My first go\\-round, I quit drinking for eight months. I thought I had emotional problems that drinking exacerbated ergo my problem wasn't drinking per se. Or so I thought. \n\nI heard someone say in a meeting the other day, \\(paraphrasing\\), \"I wasn't drinking, but I was still drunk.\" I realized that even when I wasn't drinking last year I wasn't changing myself, I held on to beliefs and ideas that rationalized and justified bad behavior and emotional abuse. I may as well have still been drinking since I wasn't making any effort to grow. I still had blinders on. I wasn't listening \\(especially to women, or my succinctly, to one in particular\\). \n\nI realized alcoholism and having trouble with alcohol isn't necessarily about having a problem with drinking; it's about have a fragile emotional constitution that can't hold up to the effects of substances that change your mental state. I know now that it is my duty to change myself by first realizing that much of what I let define myself is wrong and needs to be rebuilt from the ground up. I am scared at the prospect of having to do that. I don't know what it means for who I will become. \n\nIt took losing an entire life and some of my dearest friends to realize that I had a problem. That I wasn't properly looking outside of myself at my own behavior. I finally looked back and saw how all the times I lashed out at people there was a common thread: alcohol. How all these times were related. The anger, the text messages, the emails. I was always drunk. I never thought about it because I thought I was justified in getting angry. \n\nAnd probably one of the things I have the hardest time with is that while I acknowledge that I need to grow and let go of resentments past and present many of those resentments are predicated upon a perception that there are injustices wrought upon certain types of people in this world. And I don't want those to be collateral to me changing and learning not to rely on other people. I think in general we need to show people more compassion especially when they are socially maladjusted or aneurotypical. That mental health isn't just a problem for the individual to overcome, but a collective problem that is incumbent upon all both the afflicted and the not to help in resolving. Unfortunately I used those beliefs as a cudgel to lash out at people and I feel I delegitimized those sentiments in the process. \n\nI'm struggling a lot right now. I feel very isolated. I missed my best friend's birthday because she wants to keep distance from me right now because she feels she was enabling behavior that if she were in the position of the person I was acting that was towards, she would feel unsafe. We are going to reconnect in mid\\-June and she said she would go to an AA meeting with me, but I feel like I undermined her trust in me through how I acted. \n\nI moved to a new city six months ago and I only have a few friends. I mostly just work, come home and sit in bed all day watching television and movies. I'm scared it's never going to get better. I have no motivation to do anything. I can't get people to notice me or be friends with me or date me. I have no idea how to get people's attention. How to get invited to things. How to make friends. I barely function socially. I'm scared. I'm trying but I don't know if I have the patience. ",

   "selftext": "Greetings All,\n\nI'm not much for social/online networking of any sort, but came across this sub while researching for advice on getting off the sauce.\n\n48 yo male. I had my first drink in high school \\(beer\\) and pretended to like it for peers. Was much more into weed and psychedelics. Did not drink from age 18 to 24 with rare exception, unless in a relationship where it was the \"fun\" thing to do. Then I went into US Navy for 4 years. Let's just say that's where I learned what it feels like to be an addict. I dreaded not having rum and whiskey and mixers in the barracks. Was polishing off liters like water... But at some point I got tired of increasing the size of my clothes and not feeling attractive. Stopped on a dime. Committed to triathlete behaviors and stayed off the sauce, save for the occasional \"celebration.\" This lasted for nearly 20 years. \n\nSo, forward to January of 2018. My wife of 24 years dies at home, after suffering a rare brain disease for 4 years. I am at her side and my 2 grade school daughters are with me.\n\nThe grief hits me like a tsunami.\n\nMy control mechanisms go out the window. As I often describe it, I fell off a tightrope and never landed. \\(There is nothing to land on, but that another sub I suppose\\).\n\nSo, being self employed and able to take time off pretty freely, I take time off after a couple weeks and take my kids to Vegas and get suites for two weeks. I have NO family support \\(all dead except a hands\\-off mom\\) and my in\\-laws too devastated to help. In retrospect I never even thought about what I was doing. No plans. Just wanted a massive change.\n\nWell, that change came with the Vegas suite and gambling, escorts, and flowing booze. Like I said, wasn't thinking. Just doing.\n\nI binged on whiskey for the whole 2 weeks except for a day or two to recover with IV fluids and spa therapy. \n\nTold myself \"no more drinks\" on way back home.\n\nGot home, but not before stopping by grocery store and stocking up on booze and mixers.\n\nDrinking heavily, as much as possible. I sought a state of NUMB. Ignored calls and texts from people who had been helping me with the grieving process.\n\nSo, roughly 3 months of drinking every day \\(as early as 11 am...\\) and justifying it, hiding it from my kids, etc.\n\nDecided to STOP a couple weeks ago. Was fine for about 4 days then said \\(famously I guess\\), \"Oh, just today! And then I'll wait a few days!\"\n\nNope.\n\nWell, I had a big JOLT samadhi type of thing happen last Wednesday, the 23rd \\(while drinking\\). My 7 yr old daughter came into my room with a word search puzzle she was doing and she laughed and pointed at it, and said...\n\n\"I thought that said 'STOP DRINKING'.\" \\(She often comments on how she sees a different word than what is actually on a page or screen.\\)\n\nMy proverbial jaw dropped. I said, \"What?\"\n\nShe said, \"Oh nothing, Dad.\"\n\nI swore that night that I was f'ng DONE.\n\nI have not had a craving since.\n\n5 days in the box here.\n\nNo interest in \"moderation.\" I hate what this poison does to the body.\n\nI need to be there for my kids.\n\nAnd I want to be running mountains, not hiding bottles.\n\nPeace,\n\nB\n\nP.S. How do I get the # of days sober in my profile? TIA",

I was under contract to teach English in Japan. I was placed in a really small town where there was a LOT of alcoholism, drinking after work...anyway it was awful in so many ways. I was extremely lonely. I started drinking due to pressure of people around me, even though much of my childhood was spent watching my alcoholic father abuse my family. I started exhibiting signs of depression and anxiety and had panic attacks. \n\nFF to 2018, i came back in 1997. Wow i learned a LOT of Japanese there that i still remember, i genuinely love Japanese and the culture and genuinely miss it. But everytime i see a pic of my former town i have this inner twinge or flinch. 'So glad i'm not there anymore...' i mutter to myself. I truly cannot help it. A shudder of helpless ...rage or pain or anguish flows through me and i clench inwardly and start muttering to myself about how much i hated it there. \n\nAnd the weirdest thing is? I want to visit. I want to speak Japanese. I crave Japanese foods and the writing and all kinds of things. But some of the things i went through there - getting over my ex was a huge part of it, and being trapped alongside all the destructive drinking and being a participant in it myself, was another - i don't think i'll ever get over it. I don't think it'll ever leave me alone, it will never stop haunting me, i'll never forget how painful those two years were. Like pain was eating me alive and i couldn't do anything about it except succumb. \n\nThanks for listening. I am on medication to control my depression and feel 100% better. I am married and was over my ex a long time ago. I no longer have anxiety attacks. I rarely drink. But it seems some things never leave you in peace. \n\nThat's all. ",

Two days ago I was too busy to drink, then the next day I stared at my bottle of wine for an hour or so before putting it away. I was gonna go for a third day today, but failed. Failing wasn\u2019t what bothered me though. \n\nIt all started when a friend suggested we grab some beer, I agreed of course. He was buying since I was broke. He goes to check out but can\u2019t buy the beer since he still has a vertical ID (he just turned 21 a week ago). \nI\u2019m on edge after this. I\u2019m anxious, im mad, I stay calm though and expain he\u2019s 21 if they look at the ID. Turns out it\u2019s some new corporate policy and they can\u2019t do anything  so we leave. I have to bite my tongue to keep from saying something rude which isn\u2019t like me at all, and I feel bad for feeling so mad. \n\nWe decide to just go somewhere else to buy beer, and all goes well.

He is applying for jobs but hasn\u2019t heard a word back. The big reason he hasn\u2019t gotten any interviews is because he hasn\u2019t done the type of professional development that is required for his field.

It'll just present me with plenty of opportunities to make friends. Also, I'd like to set my own goal higher and aim for a 4 year degree instead of a 2 year.\n\nThe only problem is paying for it will definitely be an issue. I'll struggle but I'm sure I'll be able to barely afford it.\n\nOr my other option is stay at my current college where I'm halfway done with my 2 year degree and be miserable there.\n\nThere are almost no extracurricular activities there and most people there are there to just go to class, not to socialize on the side.\n\nI don't know, I feel like I'm being whiny and making a gigantic deal out of nothing, but this is something that means a lot to me.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nThank you so much",

   "selftext": "I had to do this today. The truth is, while I've successfully -- so far -- deleted alcohol from my body, alcoholism did some serious things to my life. Just being sober did not mean everything would feel amazing. I have a lot of things in life to change. \n\nFirst, know it's never too late to change. My grandfather recovered at 52 and has lived more a life since then than we can ever ask for. You do not need to worry about your timing in all of this. \n\nAnyway, I sat down in silence and made four columns on my notepad. I really want you guys to do this if you feel overwhelmed, lost, anxious or depressed about your drinking and your life. \n\nIn column one, just write down your feelings. Your negative thoughts. Things you resent. Things beyond your control that make you sad. Just write it all down! Now circle them, and know that anything inside that circle can be pushed to the side for now. \n\nIn column two, title it Things I Don't Have to do Anymore. This is for anything you know drags you down. No. 1 should be alcohol. Let it go past that though. Here were mine: Eat unhealthy, drive drunk, regret texts, forget things from drinking, poor financial management, avoid people because of alcohol or to hide habits of alcohol, aimlessly scroll social media constantly, seek out negative news, gain weight, look at porn, sleep weird hours. \n\nNow, in column three, write down whatever the opposite of the item in column two is. A few for me: drink 8 glasses of H2O a day, eat a fruit for breakfast, eat a veggie at dinner, offer to DD for friends (good way to meet new people actually), run in mornings, weights in evenings, find positive blogs to follow, meditate daily, binge comedies, call parents once a week, introduce yourself to a person a day.\n\nColumn three is your plays. Now make a playbook. \n\nFinally, now that your playbook is ready, remember this -- you have plenty of fans, including just about everyone in r/stopdrinking. Remember who is in your circle. If your circle is small, go build one. It's not easy, but one by one you can completely change the life you lead. \n\nThe opposite of addiction isn't sobriety, but connectivity. That's why it's not just important to eliminate what's in Column 2, but turn it around into what's in Column 3. You can't just sit there and count the days you have not drank or that will continue to be your only sense of identity. You have to build the new you. It's time to lay the first brick. \n\nIWNDWYT ",

I have a filthy rich aunt who pays for anything education based, so I get free school. It explains a lot...\nMy life was always great from the outer view. All my family lives in town, both grandparents, a set of great grandparents, aunt, uncle and cousin. I went to a nice private school and was in the same grade as my cousin. My mom was head of the PTA or whatever that thing is called. But then Id go home. I was used to seeing 2-3 large bottles of captain morgans spiced rum be drank a day. My grandma always had to drive me and my siblings home because my parents were too drunk. They worked at home and made decent money, so why not drink. They were both abusive as fuck. Id come home to being screamed at about the dumbest things possible. Im talking \"why didn't you clean my lunch up before you left for school\" and crap that any logical SOBER person would know is impossible.

Christmas of 2014 came and we had just spent the first week in our new house, then came my b-day. Right as spring break comes, my grandma calls up asking for some money to buy my grandpa insulin. My parents say no, they had a lot of payments and this and that, so the next week my grandma calls. \"Oh A--- (my (at the time) 4 year old sister) just said (I) is touching her and she's scared to say no but doesn't like it\" So I spent 4 days in the hospital after \"the house got robbed with nobody seen\" but luckily I told the cops it was some black guy so they instantly believed it... Racist pricks... But the day I get out, my brother hands me a bag with some clothes and says \"you fucked up this time, bitch probably lied but they don't care\" and i spent the rest of the school year with my grandparents. They thought my parents would treat it as a foster care type,thing. They take care of the kid, they get money. They were wrong. So they called DCF and said absolutely everything AND TEN TIMES MORE. So they come to the house with a full on swat team, k9 search the house, find a couple ounces of weed (parents personal use) instead of the \"tons of kilos of cocaine and some other crystally things they keep selling.\" They didn't bother to walk upstairs to check for bullet holes. They just asked me, (id been,called back tothe house after my \"overnight visit\") if my mom or dad had ever hurt anyone. All I wanted to say was my mom and dad were evil swine and beat the shit out of me and my older brother constantly. I couldn't do it. I made them sound amazing... And then the officers left. There were cops lined up and down the street, everybody heard. I had had one friend all throughout my life, my cousin, and had never talked to anyone else. My grandma got my aunt to believe enough she filed a restraining order on both parents and I haven't seen her since. My mom and dad lost their job the next day, losing out on the $850k they'd get off commission, if they worked there when the money came in. We had $1500 a month mortgages and 2 $500 a month car payments. We went broke quick. Sold both cars, stopped paying off the house, and last September the house was foreclosed on. Guess who we live with? Grandparents!!!! I have basically given up on these people. Im not sure what happened, but in this family of 90-105 IQ idjits, I came out with a 185-190 IQ. Its so incredibly annoying living with them and their constant arguments. Of all people, my grandma, the one who said I was fucking raping my sister, comes to me when things go wrong. She comes to me every day crying about how mean my mom is and how much of a good life she gave her when she was a kid. I don't think there is a complete hour in this house between 8am and midnight that nobody is yelling. \n\nNow that's my basic home shit, school was the basic loner life for me. Going to a private school, I can verify most of your stereotypes are true. Preppy private school girls do exist. Snobbish rich assholes are all over. Everyone competes to be the best. I was by far the smartest. Everyone hated me for it. The only friend I ever had was my cousin. He had other friends, so I was kind of the side friend,d for when they weren't there. I just focused on school, up until 5th grade. Some class, I turned in the only assignment of the semester, get a 100% and he hangs it up to show future classes, then he gives me a 0% online and I failed the class. I just got mad, but then realized nothing bad really happens if I don't do good. Then the whole DCF thing happened and I wasn't allowed to talk to my cousin. I just didn't care anymore. Once I went to highschool, another preppy private school, I met a girl. We talked for about 3 weeks before I asked her out. I had never talked to a girl but we just clicked. Started dating October 2016. November 2017 comes around, and she tells me she's switching to the local public school because she can't afford the highschool. Two days later, I go to the school to talk about enrolling for the next semester. The next day I was going to a different school. New school and I find some of my older brothers connections, quickly start selling drugs. December comes, and the girl switches. She made a couple friends, but I never really thought anything of it. There was just one guy she knew I hated and whenever I brought him up she'd get mad. We ended up breaking up the 16th of April, and the next day they were together at lunch making out. For 3 days I texted her pretending I didnt know, trying to get her to give me a reason for why she broke up with me. On the fourth day, over text, I flipped my shit. I had lost my only friend I had ever made to some douchebag whos so terrible to her. I've literally never seen her smile with him. But its kinda funny. When I flipped out, I had proof they'd been dating over two months. And she admitted it. We haven't talked in 3 weeks, and the last conversation started with her saying she regretted it and me saying have a nice life. About 3 months ago, some kid saw how successful my relationship was and asked me to help him talk to this girl I'll just call row. She hated him and now he hates her, but me and,her became,friends. When I found out the girl cheated on me, I was really fucked in the head. She asked,if I could hang out the next weekend. We had,never actually talked in person, and one thing,I found out is she has this cute AS FUUUCCCCKKKK accent. Like she's French but its not French??? Like a blunted Australian idk not the point. By the end of the night 100% official we were a thing. Then we hang out two days later and have an agreement. She tells me her shit if I tell her mine. I tell her everything, my medical problems (I have an undiagnosable heart conditions. I have an intensely hyperactive thyroid, im 5'7 and weigh 120lbs. I eat about 8k cals a day. Ill pass out if I don't eat every 6 hours. I mean eat a lot.) my family shit, and everything inbetween. Then she tells me her shit. Turns out her and my brother (her brothers 26-27 mines 20) had dated (both are bi) and,met because her brother was my brothers drug supplier. My brother ran half of this state, her brother runs... A lot. She tells me a lot of her health issues, but tells me there's one thatll come out within one month. Its been a month. She's got fucking cancer.\n\nMy whole plan was to drop out and get my GED. I am not doing good in school, drop out, work for a little, get my GED, go to the local community college for nursing. It can be done with a GED. I know a couple people who have. Im kinda just really panicked about this whole drop out situation combined with dealing to support 7 people combined with having like nobody to talk to. As much as I can talk to her, there are just things that are too hard to talk about in person. My anxiety is so bad and combined with my heart I've passed out the last 3 times we've tried talking about it. Life just has me so confused right now... Kinda just wanted to rant. My thumbs hurt now.

   "selftext": "I've never really said this aloud or even put it into words so sorry if this just ends up a huge pile of word vomit.\n\nI've always been a bit of a loner. Sure I have friends and I go do things with them, and I have a good time. But I still truly feel happy when I'm alone. Because as much as I like them, I like myself much more and I value my alone time a lot more than I hang out with them. And part of that is because I'm glad I'm not an alcoholic like one friend, or a misogynist like another. Or jobless and living with my parents like yet another. I'm not a habitual liar like another. I guess my biggest issue is narcissism because I feel like I have a solid step above them in one way or another. Truth be told I was perfectly happy living this way until I recently connected with an old friend. She just moved back to town, and I missed her dearly, and I'm very glad to have her back in my life. But that's where the problem starts. I have nothing but adoration and respect for this person. She's got a great outlook on everything and what seems like a great circle of friends (we met through work ages ago so we generally have different social circles). She knows I'm a very secluded person and respects that, which I appreciate. \n\nThe problem is, I feel myself getting jealous towards things she has, even if deep down I feel like I don't want them. She has a SO she's very fond of, and a tight knight group she trusts. I've never particularly wanted either but the more we hang our the more jealous and bitter I get about it. I feel like I should be invited to all the group chats (full of people I don't know) even though I've never liked group chats. I get jealous that this person I hold so highly spends time with other people. It's selfish, I know. But I still feel it.\n\nBedtime has been becoming more and more of me staring at my roof and feeling negativity. Jealous I'm not as well rounded as her. Wondering if my habit of pushing people away and being solitary is hurting me. Wondering what's so wrong with me, that I'm so quiet and asocial around so many people, but completely vulnerable around this one person. She honestly feels more like family than my own brother or mom. I feel broken around her, and I only feel normal around people I feel are, for lack of a better term, beneath me.\n\nI don't know why I look down on so many people. I don't know why I can't socialize normally. I don't even know if I'm even capable of being intimate with someone, mentally or physically. I don't even know the point of this post. I started writing it and sort of trailed off and I don't even know if I made all the points I wanted to. I barely even know which way is up and which way is down right now. I don't know what's wrong with me. Some sort of narcissism or sociopathy I guess. I want everything I don't have, and I look down on the people who aren't fortunate enough to have what I do. I've made my peace with being a monster long ago. I just wish I could stop the feelings of jealousy I guess.\n\nIf you made it this far thanks for reading I guess. I don't really know why I posted or what I hope to accomplish. I know I didn't really write this out well enough to convey how I feel. Hopefully I'll feel better in the morning.",

   "selftext": "I was twenty years old in March of 1998, and life was about to take a serious turn down a road I never played out in my head. The year started off pretty good. Major league baseball teams held tryouts for their farm systems and I was giving it a shot. I don\u2019t know if they still do it, but it was a great experience. I was exercising, eating better, and trying to do the right things, with the fitness knowledge that I had at the time. I drank a little bit socially, but nothing too serious. At that point, my problems hadn\u2019t surfaced yet. My mom was sick. She had pancreatitis from years of alcohol abuse, but overall seemed to be doing okay. I didn\u2019t know anything about the disease except that it was painful and made her miserable. I pretended that her health was fine or though that it was just temporary, because that\u2019s what I did, I took a major life situation and swept it under the rug for later consumption. I didn\u2019t know any better.  \n One of the teams that liked me was the Pirates. They thought enough of me to invite me down to Jupiter, Florida for a second call back. I was supposed to drive down there on March 5th, but plans changed. On the night of the 4th, I went home to gather some things together and I was going to take off in the morning. My mom was a Boxer breeder and had five or six puppies along with four grown dogs at the time, so she was keeping herself busy. When I got there that night, she wasn\u2019t doing so hot, but I had seen this before. She had morphine pump implanted in her body to ease the pain, but also had plenty of medication to do the same. She had quit drinking by then, but looking back, I don\u2019t know if it mattered. I walked into the house and saw her sitting on the floor kind of rocking and crying. I figured that she had taken too much medication again to ease the pain and was out of it because of that. I was pissed. I was leaving the next day to hopefully start a baseball career and didn\u2019t want to leave her alone like that with all those dogs in the house. I had learned how to show that I was pissed off from her. She was the queen. I kept yelling at her looking for some type of response, but all I got was a crying slur, \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t do it!\u201d. There was no way I was going to believe her because it had happened so many times before. It was a one\\-sided argument, and I eventually calmed down. I had asked her a few times if I should call an ambulance, but we never agreed to. So, I brought her upstairs, so she could lie down and sleep it off. I told her that I\u2019d be back in the morning to check on her before I went to Florida. Unfortunately, this was a normal occurrence, so I didn\u2019t think much of it.  \n As I was leaving, I was walking down the stairs and heard, \u201cNeil? Can you please get me some water?\u201d The balls on her, I thought. \u201cF\\*ck you! Get your own water!\u201d I felt bad saying it but thought that I had to show tough love, and \u2018fuck you\u2019 was how we did it in my family. So off I went to spend the night at my girlfriend\u2019s house, I wanted to spend some time with her before I left. She was a great person, and I\u2019m sure still is. She supported me in everything I did. Maybe one day I\u2019ll be brave enough to tell the story of how I screwed that one up, but not today. The next morning, I hopped into my truck and headed home, with my girl by my side, I was feeling excited about the new venture I was about to go on, and even if I didn\u2019t make it, I knew that it would be a great experience. I don\u2019t remember exactly why she was with me when I went back to the house because she wasn\u2019t coming with me to Florida, but either way, she was there.  \n When I got there, I went inside and heard water dripping. I figured that I\u2019d get my stuff and investigate later. I called for my mom, but didn\u2019t she didn\u2019t answer, and I really didn\u2019t think anything of it. I went down to the basement and saw water dripping down on my bed, and all over the floor. I had weird feeling in my gut, so I hurried up and got my stuff together. I went upstairs and saw the water leaking from the ceiling and into the living room. Oh shit. She left the bathtub on all night. This was going to throw a giant wrench in my plans, so I ran up to the second floor to turn the bathtub off. It was weird, the dogs hadn\u2019t come to greet me yet, but they were probably just hanging with mom or the puppies. I glanced in the room and saw my mom before I went to turn the bathtub off. I was trying to have a conversation with her to make sure it was okay that I left, but no there was no response. \u201cMom. What wrong with you? Can\u2019t you hear me?\u201d but still nothing. I turned the water off and went into her room, and something wasn\u2019t right. When the dogs jumped on the bed, she just kinda flowed with it and my heart sank. \u201cMom!\u201d I said so many times. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d She wasn\u2019t moving. I walked over to the bed, picked up her arm, and it was ice cold. She was dead.  \n After a few dozen \u201cOh my God\u2019s\u201d I ran downstairs like a crazy person yelling \u201cshe\u2019s dead\u201d over and over again. I remember seeing at my girlfriend\u2019s face. It was a combination of never ending love and the pain she felt because she knew what happened. Her lips were quivering, and she was shaking, but I just ran away. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I think I blacked out for a minute because I ended up down the street, on my back, and on the ground crying. When she finally had the courage to come get me, I\u2019ll never forget the love mixed with pain in her eyes\u2026 it made it all real. I was noticing someone else\u2019s pain *for me* for the very first time, it was confusing. I stopped crying and sucked it up because, all of a sudden, I felt that I had to be strong for her. It was a way to bury my feelings, and hide my emotions, and I took it.  \n When I finally got some time to myself, after the ambulance took my mom away, a couple things sunk in. My mom was dead, and my last words to her were \u201cf\\*ck you, get your own water.\u201d What? Does that feeling go away? How in the world could those be my last words to my own mother? How am I going to live with that? At the time it was the darkest place that I had ever been. We didn\u2019t always see eye to eye, but by the time she died, the dynamic of our relationship was actually pretty good. We were learning from each other, and we had respect for each other, even though it didn\u2019t show the night before. Or maybe she just respected me more than she had in the past. Either way, it didn\u2019t matter now. She was gone.  \n They did an autopsy, and found that the cause of death was sepsis, which caused the mental confusion that made me think that she had taken too much medication. The other thing is that, if I had called an ambulance the night before, she could have been treated and possibly saved. Take a wild guess where I put those emotions. Right at the bottom of every bottle I saw, *that\u2019s where*. That spring and summer was rough on my mind and my body. I got stupid. I did more stupid shit than I ever imagined possible. Thank God that my girlfriend was who she was because, if it weren\u2019t for her, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve made it through that summer. Or was she enabling me without knowing it?  \n Why am I telling you this story? Because, there are a lot of lessons to be learned from what I went through that year and an awful lot more story to tell\u2026 which is exactly what I\u2019m going to do in part 2 of this article. But for now, just know that I got through it, and even though it took me almost twenty years, I found the tools in myself to come to terms with and accept what happened. This has allowed me to grow as a person, be able to talk about it, and hopefully, pass on those tools to others that may find them beneficial.",

   "selftext": "This could get long because this is the third time I've tried shrinking the story down to explain myself. I've never shared this with anyone because how badly it has tainted my mind. I don't want this to sound like complaining, I just want to at least write it down publicly for anyone else in similar situations to know they aren't alone.\n\nI was separated from my ma, father and sister at 1y/o and adopted by my grandmother. My father is the oldest and most troublesome of his generation and ran away at 15. He is a drug addict, thug and jailbird. The family resents him. \n\nI was raised as if I were just like him, even as a child. Always being compared to him. Being told I would be like him. Called manipulative, devilish, and a compulsive liar since I was 8. I was in therapy for 6 years with them to figure out what was \"wrong\" with me. I was going to church 3 days a week, Fri-Sun. It really messed me up. I couldn't make friends because my medicines would erase my emotions. I was a middle school robot. I was convinced I was some unholy mistake that wasn't supposed to be here. Parents didn't want me, those that raised me seemed to regret it daily. Any time I was in trouble it was a lecture about my dad. I hated him to the point I daily prayed to God I wasn't born or just taken out of the world. It made me hate our religion, how could God be good if I wasn't supposed to be here, he never answered my prayers. I never felt part of the family, I can't even look at old photo albums because I don't even remember being a part of the moments captured. It was depressing.\n\nAt 14 I made contact with my father. From face value he played his parents into thinking he had turned his life around, had a girlfriend with a stepkid and a decent job. He asked me to move in with them and I agreed effortlessly to get away from grandmother. They seemed perfectly okay with me leaving. I felt like a nuisance lifted from their chest. Sadly my dad is a great liar. He is an abusive alcoholic and a generally narcissistic person. Many broken doors from this point of my life. One I was thrown through, snapped the frame right off from force. He would bounce between straightening out and off the rails like a snap. One day a 25/hr job that kept us afloat to another day it wasn't enough and he deserved more.. he was too proud to take a lower job and that cost us a lot. I ghosted my step sister in freshman year with no friends and most of hers weren't accepting of me unless I played guinea pig. I never had lunch money because she never told me about the $20 a week we were both given... I never got mine cos she never gave it to me. I was mostly depressed, I tried killing myself by overdosing a pill I won't name to avoid giving ideas to anyone else. I wrote a suicide note but I threw the pills up on multiple occasions so the note wasn't to see daylight until my father found it and told me if I was so sad living with him I should just do it. I could take that from him. My only peace of mind was art until he threw all my childhood art in a bonfire saying it was the cause of my feelings. It broke me. I stopped feeling things. I was indifferent to the world in a sense.\n\nThere were times the family was happy together and sharing memories they all could enjoy. I wasn't around for any of those so I felt out of place, I didn't belong there. It only helped me grow more distant to them. I grew a false frontal personality to play as a carefree goofball because I always loved those people in movies and I just wanted to feel something. It didn't help me grow as a person and only pushed me further down realising I was only accepted as the funny guy.\n\nAt 19 my mother had asked me to move down to another state where she was. I said yes hoping somewhere I could find a place my puzzle piece would fit nicely. So far it is the best I've gotten. She has a husband who has 3 kids. She has been their mom longer than she has been mine and they don't appreciate her at all. Her husband is a nice man but I don't think he really likes me being there. Like a squeaky training wheel that works fine but you can't wait to take off when the bike starts rolling. I do everything in my power to bring as little negativity to their lives as possible. I walk an hour+ to work every day so they can't nag about rides. I borrow them money when they are short, I buy the kids gifts to show them I won't be a dickish big stepbrother. I talk to them and help them however possible. At the same time I haven't moved forward much in life. I'm slugging upward and every step up I am grateful for but it feels as if I am in the back of a queue just too kind letting people cut in front of me. Now that I am typing this out, I literally did that at McDonalds last week! I let 3 people go ahead of me despite being ready only because they seemed in more of a rush than I was. \n\nI rejected my birth name 8 years ago, had gone by a nickname since then but nobody will take me serious about it. It is a thorn in my chest everytime I hear that name spoken. I've heard that named screamed at me daily for years on top of knowing the meaning behind why my father picked the name. I hate the story, I'm named after some sort of king's servant and it is too similar to how I feel it infuriates me. Nobody hears me when I speak and i will tell you now, I can be pretty loud at times. Even when I am clearly heard it is forgotten by the next day. My words hold no merit to anyone. Even with my friends that seem to look to me as their leader in a sense (weird way to put it but I think you understand?) things I say just go unnoticed unless they specifically ask me to make a decision for them. I've been talking into the void.\n\nAt this point I've let people trample over me like the entrance carpet of a Macy's on Black Friday. I pay $170 for internet for our house even though it's a slap in the face to call it \"our\" house when I live in the shed behind it. I get decent reception if you are curious but why the person paying for it should have to take the biggest knock seems so unfathomably unfair I haven't complained too much and they at least move it around the house where I can get the most out of it. I didn't want to move it outside; again to avoid giving anyone a reason to complain about me. These kids just sit on their phones all day streaming movies and memes to each other and don't respect me when I ask them to do their chores. I thought me being nice to them would have earned me some respect here but alas....I guess I just want someone to appreciate me...\n\nI could go and feel sorry for myself as my grandmother would say but I don't see a point in getting people to let me cry on their shoulder. To some degree writing this out is a form of therapy for me. It has helped me straighten my thoughts out, truly organise what I feel could be the root of how I function. Why I am this way. I get so pessimistic about the littlest things. It is stressful when all I use to distract myself or find joy just boils down into a negative thought somewhere down the line. It is too easy to find something wrong with anything, it's practically my greatest strength. I'm the Simon Cowell of self-deprication. I'm just tired of the negativity.\n\nI love rain. It is so calming and relaxing. I've always been astonished with how calming a thunderstorm can be despite it's violent nature. It can cause all these dangers and problems but overall it is good for the earth. There is the occasional tree fall, power outage or flood but in the end it only inspires growth for the world. It always ends and things go back to normal. I could focus on the hour we lost power or I could appreciate the storm for the good it brings the earth. It makes that small outage or tree fall so much less of an issue than I would make it out to be. I like that thought, it always brings me out of my head and back down to earth.. I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this. You give me hope..\n",

   "selftext": "**As I said, I don't expect you to read it. It's long and doesn't make any sense. I just felt like unloading the baggage that I've been carrying for so many years now. This post doesn't have one theme in particular...it's basically just random things that have been pissing me off, during certain periods of my life**\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've come to the conclusion that I don't want to live anymore. I don't have the motivation to do anything anymore. I just don't want to. I've always hated my family. I hate my friends, my colleagues, and everyone else. Good and genuine people are so rare nowadays it's damn difficult to meet one of those in a lifetime. Everyone else is fake, ignorant and uneducated. Living in a shithole of a country doesn't help much either. People here would do anything to make you feel like shit. Most of them are pretty stupid and stubborn and they think they're always right. Here, in my country, people think that mental illness is a 'choice'. You can just snap out of it whenever you want to, simple as that. 'Happiness is a choice', they say. If you see a psychiatrist, they think you're legitimately insane. They are like sheep. Everything you do 'disrespects god'. Homosexuals should burn in hell 'because the Bible says so'. Those who don't believe in God should also burn in hell 'because the bible says so'. Meanwhile, those religious assholes think they're all holy and pure, when basically, they're the worst kind of people. They're ignorant and uneducated and no matter what happens, it happens because of 'God's will'. Living in a Christian, Orthodox family, taught me that I should avoid this kind of people at all costs.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJust a few days ago, we were discussing a few recent events in my country. There has been a terrible car crash and 9 people died in it. My father was saying, unironically, that they deserved to die because they were 'trash' and they were 'goddamn gypsies who dont deserve to live'. He's said stupid shit like this on other occasions too. Whenever someone brings up the topic of gay people, he would curse them and tell me that if he ever finds out that I'm gay (I'm not) or that I'm hanging out with gay people, he will cut me off completely and never talk to me again. He hates everyone who is different or doesn't agree with his views, and I fucking despise him for that. I can't stand the fact that I have a racist and homophobic father.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOn top of that, my current mental state doesn't allow me to cope with all this bullshit. I'm fed up with everything and everyone. I should be writing my thesis right now but instead, I'm stuck here thinking about how much I hate my country and people, in general. I've been suffering from depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, depersonalization/derealization and OCD (Pure-O) for years and it's getting more and more difficult for me to deal with my environment and with myself. During these years, I've been trying various tratments and pills but nothing ever worked. Also, I've been in therapy for years, sometimes changing therapists in order to see if someone will be able to shed some light on my situation. I know that therapy helps some people but it personally doesn't help me. Seeing that nothing makes me feel better, naturally, I turned to drugs. I've never done hard drugs like heroin, coke or meth, but I sometimes mess around with MDMA, DXM and codeine. I live alone in a 1-room apartment, in a different city, far from my family. But so it happened that one day, my mother visited me and found my stash. I know I should've probably been more careful but at that point, I literally didn't give a fuck about hiding my drugs, since I was the only person living there and I thought that no one would search for anything in my house, as long as I'm there. But anyway, my mother was pissed at me. Knowing her, I sincerely thought she'd smack my face but she was surprisingly calm. She just told me that she didn't want me to be a 'fucking junkie' and that I should stop. Now, here's the thing: I've tried many depression and anxiety meds, tried therapy, tried many diets, excercise, tried yoga and many more...even fucking praying and colon cleansing. I was so depressed that I was basically on the verge of commiting suicide all the time. Drugs saved me at that point. I would have killed myself during those dark times if I didn't have drugs. It never turned into addiction, though. I would always leave at least 1 or 2 weeks of break between dosing. I never took huge quantities of substances and I've never re-dosed in the same day. I never mixed substances with one another and never messed with dangerous combos. I consider myself to be a responsible user and my drug use has never gotten out of hand. However, my parents didn't understand this. They wouldn't understand that using drugs in recreational purposes, every now and then, was not going to harm me. My mother, of course, told my father about it. He went absolutely berserk, yelling at me and cursing, saying that he hates me and that he's ashamed of me. He keeps saying that he hates druggies and that I'm a disappointment. Here, in my country, drug users aren't seen as simply drug USERS. They're seen as ADDICTS. People here don't know the difference between 1) being hopelessly addicted and 2) using a substance in a responsible way, in order to get a desired effect or in order to get a sense of relief from mental or physical pain. Ironically, most people here are smokers and alcoholics. We are one of the leading countries when it comes to alcoholism. My father is - ironically - an alcoholic and a smoker ever since he was 8 years old. He gets drunk every few days and smokes 1 pack of cigarettes a day. My mother keeps telling me that \"drugs are bad\" and that \"I am responsible for my own happiness\" while basically popping Xanax every day (she's also been on Prozac and Anafranil). She thinks that praying is the only solution to a person's torment but doesn't want to admit that the only reason why she hasn't killed herself is because she's on antidepressants (she also doesn't agree that the pills have helped her, and doesn't want to give up on them either). This is basically the mentality of everyone in my area. They smoke 1 or 2 packs of cigarettes a day, they drink like crazy, they're addicted to gambling and poker, they pop Xannies like they're fucking tic tacs, they're addicted to caffeine, they're addicted to sugar, they're addicted to junk food, yet they HATE 'druggies'. I'm so fed up with this and I feel so alone because no one believes that I'm genuinely struggling, they all think I'm just using my mental illness as an excuse to be a recluse, avoid responsibility and do drugs. In reality, I really WISH I could be healthy. I wish I could have a normal life, I wish I could get more involved and be more productive but I just can't find the energy and strength to do so. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI can't live like this anymore. I can't live in a country full of ignorant, uneducated fools but I don't have the financial means to move abroad either. I can't take my family anymore but I depend on them. I can't stand abuse from people, but I can't stand being alone either. I feel trapped and judged. I feel like no one understands or cares about my pain. Sorry for the long post, I'm just so desperate and don't know where to run and what to do...",

   "selftext": "Throwaway even though this story will be so specific that anyone in attendance would immediately know it's me, but at least they won't know my real reddit username. Oh well. Hopefully this doesn't ramble too much, but these thoughts have been swirling around my head for the last day and a half and I'm hoping that by putting this into words that it may be helpful or even therapeutic. As a quick introduction to me, I (27M) am a generally quiet and reserved guy from a small town with some symptoms of an anxiety disorder in the past. I say in the past because I rarely feel that type of anxiety anymore, but as a child from about the age of 7 or 8 until I was a sophomore in college, age 19, I had such a nervous stomach I would puke in private and in public whenever I was nervous about an upcoming situation where I would have some pressure or attention on me, didn't matter if it was a school dance, a date, or an athletic event, or as a little kid just being away from home overnight. The last time I felt sick this way was my first week of my sophomore year of college when I threw up every morning, four or five days in a row, but that was the last time it ever happened. It could be a result of starting to smoke weed later that year, and drinking a bit starting the year after that, but since then I wouldn't say I've had substance abuse issues with either, and during any stretches where I went months without smoking or drinking my anxiety never resurfaced like before. I maintained through college with a healthy social circle and relationship that lasted about a year, learned a lot and generally enjoyed myself. \n\nSince then my social circle has definitely shrunk, as they do when people get older, but I feel like I'm more comfortable when I can be by myself anyhow, which is what I preferred growing up too. I never had a problem making friends, but I lived in the country outside of town for the first 15 years of my life so I naturally had a barrier between my public and private life by virtue of the literal distance between me and my friends. I know that this contributed to my personality and tendencies now, and as you may imagine I am by no means a manly man, alpha type guy now. I am into sports though, I appreciate cars (tho I don't know shit about the internals), and am very into music, so from an outside perspective I may not come off as a nerd, though I am at heart. I play some video games, and I can appreciate a well sung ballad or a well written poem. I have always been sensitive, and I still don't like to be the center of attention. But considering all this, I am pretty proud of the life I've built so far. I never had to move back home or anything like that, I've always been working since graduating college, and since graduating about 4.5 years ago I'm a couple years into a decent career working in a government office, living with a great woman who I will marry less than a month from now, and living in a great new space outside the small city where we work, in a beautiful part of the country. All in all, I am very thankful for my life and from day-to-day feel happy. As a melancholy kid who had some periods of depression I know what it feels like to be sad, so I can confidently say that I enjoy my life now and look forward to the future.\n\n\nNow, as you probably realized I am an engaged man, and this past weekend was my bachelor party. It was organized by my older brother (34M) and bro-in-law (47M), who really went through a lot of effort and expense to make this happen. I didn't ask for it at all, and am still just flattered that they would do this. They both had to travel and spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars this weekend to make it special for me. These guys have obviously known me and my personality since I was young (since I was about 10 years old for my bro-in-law), and I have looked up to them as role models probably more so than anyone in my life. Both are family men with great careers, who are also reserved and just smart, humble guys. Also attending the festivities were my little brother (25M) and my oldest friend from growing up (27M). There were a couple others in attendance, but only these 4 and I were there for the incident so they are the only ones relevant to my long winded story. \n\nThe weekend had been going great, it was better than anything I could ask for, full of golf, some big league baseball, and many alcoholic beverages. The guys didn't let me pay for (almost) anything, and everyone seemed to be having a great time. I definitely didn't mind staying up late and having some drinks in a calm setting, but my older brother kept talking about going to this country bar up the street and having me ride the mechanical bull there. We all kind of laughed about it and no one else really seemed that keen on the idea, laughing (I thought) because that's clearly something so outside the realm of what I would want to do, but he still mentioned it once in a while. The baseball game that night went late and we were sat at the bar across the street for a while, and I kinda figured this would be our last stop for the night. Totally fine with me. But as you guessed it, we all had a strong drink and got the motivation to check out the country bar after all. It was a couple blocks away and I figured we'd just go for a couple drinks and to laugh about how out of place we were among the younger crowd and then call it a night. But almost as soon as we got there my older brother and bro-in-law started going on about the fucking mechanical bull. The place was packed and pretty wild, with girls dancing on the bar and all that. Fun for some, but not my cup of tea and not a setting I had been in for years. There was a line for the bull and they essentially kept taking turns standing in line for me while the other would come over and try to coax me into doing it. I went from laughing it off, to basically just shaking me head \"no\" while sipping my drink. They were insistent, and my old friend even started to tell me to just go for it. While I know that it would have all been over in about thirty seconds, we could laugh about it and move on, I am also a stubborn bastard so I never gave in. I just kept saying \"nah\" and minding my business. It started off innocent enough, but as they went on I began to make the whole incident bigger and bigger in my head, like it was some rite of passage that I was just rejecting. This made me even more resistant because in my head it's becoming a bigger deal and then if I decide to finally do it then they'll make a big scene about it and whoop and holler or whatever. You would think I'm just exaggerating their attempts to make me do it but it got to a point where my bro-in-law literally said \"well if he's not going to do it then I'm leaving\" and fucking left! The tone of the whole night got weird, and the next time my older brother bought us a shot we toasted to \"my manhood\", his choice. \n\nThe whole thing started to feel like slow motion as I started to panic about how I was basically disappointing them by acting like a little wuss and not riding the bull, and it took me straight back mentally to the way I would feel as a little kid in those situations where I'm being pushed to do something I'm uncomfortable with and basically claming up and shutting everyone down. It was so weird and unexpected but at that point it felt like the damage had been done. Now, I know I'm lame in that type of setting, I am not the life of the party and I have fully accepted that at this point in my life, and thus going to the club on a Saturday is not my idea of a good time, but I really felt like I had let these men down who have been blowing all this money on me for two days and I couldn't repay with the simple act of \"enjoying myself\" in that way. My older brother kept saying \"these people (at the club) don't know you\" which just made me more embarrassed that he thought I was acting too cool. It would have made it memorable, sure, but I never asked for that kind of thing. I wandered around the club kinda freaking out for another thirty minutes cause I couldn't bear being around them, and then eventually came back and said we should call it a night. We walked outside and it was kinda quiet at first until my little brother said innocently \"it sure would have been entertaining if you had gotten on the bull\" and I shot back something like \"hell no, that was not gonna happen!\" and laughed about it and they all laughed too and then we moved on, having a more normal (drunken) conversation on our walk back to the hotel. \n\nIt felt like it was all *almost* behind me until I got back to the room I was sharing with my bro-in-law, the one who had left early, and he was in bed still awake on his phone. He said something like \"did you ever get on that bull?\" and I replied joking \"nah, I wouldn't have done that if you weren't there\" and without hesitation he said \"you wouldn't have done it even if I was there\", not joking but like it was a matter of fact. Ouch. I didn't say anything back, and went into the bathroom for a couple minutes, and by the time I came back out he was asleep, so that was the last we spoke that night. I didn't really sleep for a couple hours just laying there drunk and going over and over what had happened and getting really down on myself for being such a lame ass, and basically not a man in the eyes of these men who I admire. What an asshole I was for letting them fund this whole weekend in the city but not having the balls to get on the bull. The next morning while we had breakfast and then parted ways I still felt that tone of disappointment there, like they wouldn't look me in the eyes and didn't really have much to say to me. It could have easily been the fact they were hungover, feeling like shit, waiting for coffee and food, but in my mind they were just biding their time before they could get away from me. They wanted to see what kind of man I was now, and it turned out that I was still the same little scared kid I had always been. I don't remember the last time I felt ashamed like this, and I am scared that I won't really get over it, like it was some defining moment in my life and I made the choice to sit on the sidelines, which I did often growing up. And I'm afraid my older brother and bro-in-law and even my old friend won't forget it either. My little brother was kind of clueless to the situation, but I know the tone shifted that night. I texted them both to thank them for everything, but they just gave me short replies.\n\nI'm hoping that by putting this on reddit that I will be able to get some perspective on the situation and see how I'm really making a big deal out of a dumb situation. I told my fiance and she laughed it off with me, saying she was surprised that they even were trying to push that on me. I didn't let on how much it is bugging me though because I feel like she doesn't understand it from my perspective as a man. I am not one who subscribes to the traditional notion that a man has to do dumb pointless shit like ride mechanical bulls to prove his manhood, but there is still that innate desire to do those types of things to be prove ourselves among us monkey-brained males, and I can't escape it. Like it's some larger reflection on my life up to this point and now going forward. As you can tell, I am definitely one to hyperanalyze a situation and overthink myself into a stupor, but this whole thing was a nightmare and I don't want it to sour an otherwise fantastic bachelor weekend. I don't want to it put me back into a bad place mentally, especially with less than a month to go before our wedding, so hopefully I'm just being ridiculous and overcritical of myself. I'll appreciate any and all input. Thanks.\n\nTL;DR - Family members tried to get me to let loose on my bachelor weekend but I shut them down. Feeling guilty and ashamed that I passed on the opportunity to prove myself in some primitive sense. Can't get past the idea that they will always see me as less than a man now.",

   "selftext": "So this past weekend was my first time spending an entire weekend sober in a while. \n\nAs a little background, around five years ago I lost a good job due to drinking - specifically from showing up late, calling in sick regularly and being hungover or still partially drunk, stinking of booze, you get the idea.\n\nAfter this, I decided to change my behavior and never drink on a work night. Over the years I've made similar rules for myself, regarding types of alcohol I drink and times that I drink. \n\nSince then I have stuck to this resolution, but I still drink on the weekends. Usually the second I'm home from work on Friday I crack a beer and usually stay up all night binge drinking by myself. Once I have one beer, I can't stop and usually drink until daybreak or until all of the alcohol is gone. I often drink more than a case of beer or a liter of vodka on these days. \n\nEssentially I have made myself into a functional alcoholic. I don't even have fun or enjoy myself while drinking, I just sit in a depressive fog listening to music. Additionally, the aspect of drinking not interfering with my work hadn't completely worked out because I got wasted at a work conference with an open bar and embarrassed myself in front of colleagues that I really respect. \n\nI'm really trying to quit drinking all together because I realized that it is bad for my health both mentally and physically. Considering the amount I drink, it also consumes my weekend. I feel like garbage during the week due to lack of sleep and most likely the heavy calories from binge drinking and then binge eating when hungover. Usually on Wednesday or Thursday I start to feel good again before I get wasted on Friday.\n\nThis has become such a routine for me, that it is really difficult to break. On Fridays now, if I don't drink, I feel very agitated and bored. I find if I can make it through Friday night, I will wake up Saturday and go run errands and find things to do. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice or been in a similar situation? \n\nI like to play video games and I want to start working out, but honestly I'm unsure what else to do in my free time.\n\nI am not interested in AA, I have gone to meetings in the past and didn't like it or find it helpful for me personally. \n",

I try to go in three days a week, though, so I\u2019ll go in for the remaining days this week. \n\nThe bachelorette party went pretty well. We went to tea, and the bachelorette really liked it. We had so much fun, and the tea and snacks were great. Then, we went to the Met, looked at some of the exhibits, and then went to the roof. When that closed, we ended up going back to the bachelorette\u2019s apartment, ordered Indian food, did some spa stuff, and watched My Best Friend\u2019s Wedding. By the end of it, I was really tired, since I had been up by five am. I ended up sleeping with the bachelorette in her bed, and then the others slept on the pull-out couch and floor. It was good that I slept in her room, though, because we woke up way before everyone else. Then, we made mimosas and went to get bagels. It was a great time, and she had fun, which was the point. \n\nI love my friend (I\u2019ll call her Cosette). We\u2019ve been best friends since the third grade (almost 20 years now), and we\u2019ve been through everything together.

I helped her with all of her design work for the wedding, and I know she appreciates that. Even though we haven\u2019t lived in the same town since middle school, we\u2019ve kept in touch. We\u2019ll be friends for life.\n\nAnother think Cosette did for the bridesmaids is get us Swell water bottles. [I got this one.](https://www.swellbottle.com/zeus) I wanted it to be gray because my ecosystem for drink ware is gray. It may sound stupid, but everything in my life has to match. So my iced tea bottle is gray, my other water bottle is gray, my big water bottle is gray, and now my Swell bottle is gray. For awhile, Hydroflask was my ecosystem. I got all Hydroflask stuff. But then I wanted the Swell thing and the iced tea thing, so I had to change it. I have one water bottle that\u2019s purple, but that matches my bike, so it\u2019s ok. \n\nI have a lot of ecosystem problems. All Apple stuff. All muted fabrics for my backpack purse/daily uses. Glass and white towels for cleaning supplies. In fact, all towels are white. Stuff like that. My therapist thinks it\u2019s part of the OCD. \n\nAnyway, how are you all?",

   "selftext": "  TL;DR: My brother is suicidal and getting wasted every night. He blames it on his ex leaving him, but I think he has some underlying mental disorder that is causing him to behave this way. He had a stint in a mental institution, but they couldnt diagnose him because he wouldn't cooperate. What should I do?\n  \nI'm going to try and give you all plenty of background knowledge so please forgive me if it doesn't flow right or it's repetitive or rant-y.\n  \nMy brother is 27. He's never made good choices and doesn't really accept responsibility for his actions. He also refuses to listen to and does the opposite if what people advise him to do. As of now he is suicidal and partying a lot, drinking and driving. \n  \nHis senior year of high school him and my mom got into a fight and he said something about killing people at school; she told him not to go to school talking like that because he's get in a lot of trouble. Well, the next day he told someone he wanted to blow up the school and was arrested then put in a mental institution. That kinda started everything in his adult life even though I would say the problems started in middle school with him refusing to do homework.   \n  \nAnyway, the felony terrorist charge was a setback for him, but my grandfather paid to have it expunged sometime in the 1-2 years following the incident. After it was expunged he was able to apply to college and got accepted, BUT when he got there he still refused to do his homework. With me and everyone else telling him he couldn't pass unless he did his homework, he refused. Flunked out and hasn't tried to help himself since. This was about 7 years ago.     \n  \nHe's also always been super sensitive and absolutely hateful. Definitely thinks he can do no wrong, thinks he's a genius, etc. Just generally narcissistic qualities. \n  \nNow things in the past year have really made a turn for the worst. His girlfriend of 6-7 years left him, and for good reason. He's a mean person and they would fight over the dumbest stuff. He would scream at her over the phone calling her a cunt and being extremely verbally abusive. Then they moved in together. He cheated on her with multiple people, they broke up for a while, and got back together. (I also want to add that I have *never* liked this girl and still don't, but no one deserves to be treated that way. )   \n  \nAlmost a year ago she broke up with him for good and he has been going crazy ever since. All of the negative qualities i've mentioned have gotten worse and I'm really concerned about his mental health.   \n  \nBack in January or February my mom called the police on him because he was being so crazy and talking about suicide and being violent. When I talked to him he said that my mom and dad told him they didnt care if he was alive or dead, but they said they never said that. My parents do everything they can to help him and he is such an entitled asshole to them. For example, a few months ago he totaled his vehicle he saved up some money to buy it and they covered the rest. He's supposed to pay them back, but they still helped with the initial purchase. He only pays 200 dollars of the 550 dollar rent and has never paid any utilities. When he had a truck he absolutely refused to help with the farm.  He hasn't even gone to see our grandpa in years and Grandpa is the reason he was able to get a truck in the first place.  He wants to get a decent job so he can have nice things, but doesn't want to do any work to get it. ( Refused to do his work in college and when I suggested a trade job he said that was too much work).   \n  \nWhat I'm getting at is EVERYTHING bad in his (adult) life is a result of his own choices. I'm also the type of person who cuts people slack based on their upbringing. (For example, if your mother sold you to men for drugs as a child, I can totally see why you have a hard time making good choices in your adult life. The trauma you experience and how you are brought up totally effects the options you have to make your life better when you can finally make choices for yourself) I am not just blaming him for things that are out of his control. \n   \nNow that I have gone into all that, I want to talk about recent events. You all already know his girlfriend leaving him sparked this spiraling descent into depression (?) and substance abuse. When it initially happened (Jan-Feb) my husband and I told him over and over again to block her on all social media. He claimed she would trail him along and stuff like that; giving him hope that they would get back together. He would be like \"oh yeah, okay\" but NEVER blocked her. Still, Things seemed to get better as time went on. He totalled his vehicle and I was really worried, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. He started going out and making friends. I thought it was a good thing, but he is so far gone.    \n  \nEver since he got his vehicle he has stayed out all night literally every night drinking and doing coke. He comes home between 5am and 8am totally fucking wasted. He has also been taking alcoholic drinks to go whenever he leaves from wherever he's coming from. He told me 4 days ago hr had 7 dollars to his name (supposed to get paid today) and he has been out every night since.  I know he's partying because he's wasted.\n  \nA couple mornings ago he told my younger (13 y/o) brother that he wanted to kill himself right before my little Brother caught the bus. That bothered me a lot because he doesn't need to be traumatizing the kid before he goes to school. If he needs help, he knows my husband and I are available. I, of course, talked to my younger brother about it. Just to curb that whole situation to the best of my abilities. Afterwards, I called my older brother just so I could be like \"yo, that's not cool\". I also told him he needs to quit partying because it is HORRIBLE for his mental health. Like, I have great mental health and i've done my fair share of partying, but partying makes me feel horrible if I do too much. I *know* it has to have detrimental effects on him.  He also has this idea that no one in our family cares about him. His response to me saying he needs to quit partying was \"at least I'm around people who care about me\"   \n  \nThese people would not even fuck with him if he didnt buy drugs and party with them. People who don't discourage you from making poor life decision are not your friends.    \n  \nI guess I will end it there because idk what else to say.   \n  \nWhat should I do in this situation? I'm not sure how to even start a conversation with him. I know he needs professional help, but I don't know how to go about that, either. If anyone has any advice for me I would appreciate it. Or even advice I could relay to him would be great. I just don't know what to do and I don't want to lose my brother to suicide.  ",

   "selftext": "first cousin once removed\\*\n\nIt was the summer before my senior year in high school when he first moved in with us. We'd only met once before this, so we didn't have an established relationship as cousins. I always felt this strange tension with him before anything happened. He later admitted he did too. Probably because we were both practically strangers with raging hormones close in age. I'm usually the calm and level\\-headed type and he was the wild one. Yet I was the one who gave the push past the point of no return. Maybe it was because I was bored at home in the summer at the time and curious about the tension. Maybe I wanted to do something crazy for once because I'd always been so straight laced. Strangely, the relationship first ignited over a misunderstanding.\n\nThe first few weeks he was there were fun at first, because I had someone my age around the house. Then I started to sympathize with him as we learned his story of how he never had a steady family life and spent most of his life hanging out on the street. My mom and I started to feel protective over him and wanted him to feel like we could be his family. We wanted him to feel included and cared about. One night, I innocently grabbed his hand to make him feel better. He held it back until my brother who was asleep next to us, rolled over. He flinched and pulled his hand away. I was super confused for a moment then realized what he thought it had meant. From then on things were different.\n\nEvery night we would have our own personal movie nights. We'd wait until it was close to bed time and everyone was going to sleep. We'd lay on the couch with a blanket over our laps and he'd caress my hands. That was all we would do for weeks and every day we'd look forward to it. Then one late night, I took the initiative and texted him asking what he wants. He asked for a kiss.\n\nFrom then things progressed quickly over the next few nights. We ended up both having our first times with each other silently in my bathroom at 3am with the risk of someone waltzing in. The first of many times we would end up doing super risky sex with everyone in the house. Tbh I didn't really think of how weird it was in the moment, I genuinely thought I was in love. I never thought of him as a family member.\n\nWe ended up breaking up soo many times. You have no idea how physically painful it is to break up with someone multiple times and have to keep living in the same house pretending nothing's changed. My chest would physically hurt and I felt suffocated in my own house. I had no one to talk to about my problems.\n\nEventually, when he moved out with his mom we stupidly outed ourselves. We were hanging around each other too much and neighbors noticed. His mom \\(whom he told about us\\) said we should just tell my parents before the neighbors did. Of course, it ended up as you would expect. My dad went ballistic but my mom tried to get him to ease down and decided to support us. My brother said he didn't know who I was anymore and nearly hit me once in an argument over my cousin. My dad met with my cousin secretly. He said he'd forgive him and accept him back into his home if he forgot about me. He said no. A lot of other things went down but this post is already too long. We ended up meeting every night for about an hour only, because my dad would want me back home immediately. This went on for awhile until later that year when my cousin moved away with his mom and her new boyfriend to another city. Despite what my brother and father wanted, we stayed together and occasionally visited each other when we saved up enough money for greyhound.\n\nTo spare you the headache of our toxic issues over three years, we ended up being on and off in a roller coaster of a relationship with brief meetings until he finally broke the last straw. We still remained in contact afterwards and I realized that I truly did love him because despite it all, I cared deeply for his well being. Eventually though I ended up getting a new number after I found out he moved in with someone. I felt it was time for both of us to go on to a new chapter.\n\nI feel guilt because he never had a traditional family setting growing up and watched several alcoholic men abuse his mom \\(who btw sold her own son's clothes for cigarettes\\). My parents were the opportunity for him to actually have parental figures in his life and I feel like I fucked that up. I can't help but wonder if we hadn't done what we did, he wouldn't be doing and selling drugs and hitting his new \\(nearly double his age\\) girlfriend when he's drunk. He was always crazy sure, but he never did those things before, and even told me that he never wants to become the type of man his mom was always with. Was this inevitable or was it preventable?\n\nI still don't know if this whole ordeal was worth it or not. It caused a lot of family drama \\(I don't recommend ever sleeping with your blood folks\\) and possibly affected his future. Yet I wouldn't have learned all the things I did or evolved so much emotionally. I also gained a whole new perspective of many things in life. I don't know if he learned anything significant out of the situation, he's always been a knucklehead and to be honest from the outside it seems that he's the same mentally. I always tried to convince that he wasn't stupid, even though he always said he was because of his grades. I feel like he just used that as an easy excuse to never absorb anything.\n\nBTW to make this story even worse, let me add a very new development. My cousin has a brother. But they grew up in separate environments because his mother abandoned him \\(tbh I think he was the one that got lucky\\). They still hung out though and they talk often. I only just saw his brother again after like 5 years about a week ago. His mannerisms and voice reminded me so much of my cousin it drove me insane. I felt the tension again but it was obviously because he reminded me of him and there was no way I was going to do anything. I learned my lesson and felt no desire to commit the same mistake. But *he* ended up trying to hit o\\*n \\*me.\n\nThe first day I was there he sat very close to me and was trying to start conversation. The rest of his family noticed and they all knew about the prior situation so it was very awkward. His sister tried to ask me the question with her eyes and I just looked away. So she moved on to his brother to do the same and they exchanged a pair of looks I wish I hadn't witnessed. The rest of my stay there was so awkward because every time he smiled at me or laughed at something I said he'd get shut down by his family and end up mad or embarrassed. I wanted to die because he's my cousin too, now I can't even have a normal relationship with him as family because of what happened with the other one. Not only that but he actually seemed interested, I'm guessing his brother probably blabbed everything about me to him. I did my best to pretend that I didn't know what was going on, but to be honest I don't think I ever want to go over there again.\n\nAnyway, that's the end of my story. I don't know if anyone would actually read this, but it feels good to let it all out. I had no one to really talk to about this. And before anyone says it, no we're not from the south lmfao.",

   "selftext": "I\u2019ve officially made it 24 days w/o alcohol. It\u2019s been really tough because I\u2019ve been fighting this battle with alcohol for years. I\u2019m only 24, a female, so most people would ask how is it that alcohol had become such a problem for me so young. Well, at first it was just for fun, then it turned into me acting crazy, doing stupid embarrassing things, drunk binges, forgetting almost every night out, hiding bottles in my room/bathroom, becoming a full blown alcoholic. To be honest, I got to that point bc I refused to come to terms with how trashy I felt. I couldn\u2019t even go anywhere for fun without alcohol. I would keep small bottles on me. Alcohol ruined a 3.5 yr relationship for me, several friendships, jobs, and it tainted my image severely. Alcohol became a part of my identity, and alcohol was taking down my life FAST. I made it the center of my world, and I knew it deep down but I preferred to drown reality in alcohol. I\u2019ve been subscribed to r/stopdrinking since December, reading people\u2019s posts, resetting my badge after days, relapsed over and over, but I always got back up and tried again because it\u2019s better to try than give up altogether. Do not accept defeat. Keep fighting. I\u2019ve tried to be that person that has a few glasses of wine, then it turns into two bottles. Then I would turn to drug use so I could drink even more, and repeat the destructive cycle. I made a decision on May 5th that I would make the decision to give up alcohol because the failed experiments were never going to change. I would look around at the people my age who have already finished school, stayed in relationships, getting married and having kids, buying houses, all that great normal people stuff and I wanted it so badly because I wanted to have something to feel accomplished about. I feel like I had nothing. Now I\u2019m eating healthy, working out everyday, waking up early, reading books, and even getting creative with cooking (I love cooking), and I slowly feel like the real me before I started drinking heavily is starting to come back. Before I started drinking, that was the real me, someone who could live life to the fullest and someone who was genuinely happy. The mess I was 24 days ago, hasn\u2019t came back and the benefits of life without alcohol outweigh anything alcohol has to offer to me (a shitty life). The real me is a fighter, a person with conviction, and a big heart. I will not let alcohol dull my shine anymore. If you\u2019re struggling, don\u2019t give up. Take it a day at a time and don\u2019t accept defeat. #IWNDWYT ",

I tired to have a heart to heart with her once but it did not go well and our relationship has suffered since.\n\nI have extremely strong feelings to back out of being her Maid Of Honor but her wedding is next month in June.

She has told me on more than one occasion she is only getting married to this man because she accidentally got pregnant and now their have a child. My BF has said multiple times that if her child was not with this person they would not be getting married. She is clearly still in love with someone else. She is not sexually attracted to him. Her so called fiance slept with one of their mutual 'friends' 2 months after he proposed to my BF. He is unwilling to compromise on most things. He is very much set in his ways and refuses to try co\\-parenting they way my BF would like.\n\nMore info I have witnessed over the last 8 months about my BF's fiance. He is an alcoholic and not a functioning one. He has fallen asleep multiple times while alone with his daughter, he has dropped her from his lap, drunk. He has drunkenly let her roll off a double high mattress bed onto the floor, and he left his daughter unsupervised inside of the house for 10 minutes or longer at a time to go outside and smoke cigarettes. \\(To clarify, this little girl will be 18 months in June.\\) And he is a 45 year old human that doesn't take responsibility for his own actions. He also has no health insurance, no financial stability, is in a serious amount of debt that he has neglected for over a decade. I honestly could keep going, the list is never ending. He doesn't treat my BF with respect, he is narcissistic, and manipulative. \n\nI am also only one of several close friends that has had a serious heart to heart with her about this marriage. At the time she became pregnant and he moved into her house her other two roommates moved out within a month because neither could stand to be around her fiance. ",

Told me I was just blowing off steam, that I was safe because I was with friends, that I\u2019m okay because I don\u2019t do that every night. I\u2019m eating garbage right now, pizza and Dr. Pepper but it seems to ease the withdrawal symptoms so I\u2019m giving myself leeway for the next 7 days. Even with all my drinking I\u2019m usually a healthy eater which contributed to the denial. Sorry for the rambling post. I\u2019m glad to have this community for support and I plan to spend a lot of time here in the next few weeks. ",

   "selftext": "A belligerent asshole who thinks its burning man 365 days / year went on a road trip w/ some friends &amp; I last weekend. My buddy warned me in advance that this guy was coming and said that he felt bad about the struggle he was going through. I wish I had done more to try and convince him not to bring him.\n\nFor 3 days straight this guy is up doing coke drinking all of the booze. He kept fucking with everyone. For example, I was hanging out laying on the floor and this dude steps over my head wearing a kilt, intentionally showing his balls to me.  Combine this with hand stands in kilts and arriving downstairs in a tutu w/ nothing else on Saturday night and he was basically sexually assaulting everyone on the trip, exposing himself to as many people as possible. At one point he blurts out to one of the girls completely out of context... \u201cso do you like it rough?\u201d It completely freaked her out. No one else was naked, no one else was out of control, no one other than him are the kind of people who decide to wear tutus without underwear in a house full of total strangers.\n\nWe continued about the weekend mostly ignoring him until the last night. After having been shunned by everyone he comes through the living room where my friend and I are laying down chatting. He makes several passes. Opening / closing blinds. Turning on lights asking us if we want the lights on or off. It was all so weird because he really had no business being in that room. On his last pass he mutters to us  \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck w/ you\u201d and attempts to mount my friend and I.\n\nI shove him off of us as hard as I can and start shouting at him to get away. Friends start pouring into the room. Dude runs at me and I grab an empty wine bottle from the kitchen counter. Before he gets to me my buddy gets him in a head lock. I hand the bottle to another friend and walked out of the house fuming mad.\n\nI have no patience for these kinds of assholes any more.  I\u2019ve had past issues with similar personalities. Something deep down in me really wanted to smash that bottle over his head. Like fucking this guy up would somehow make me feel better about having to share air with these mindless junky alcoholics (I known it wouldn\u2019t have.) When I got back from my walk all of the stories started coming out. Everyone had some sort of creeper story about this guy but they were biting their tongues to keep the piece.\n\nThat night no one felt safe. At one point he wandered naked into a couple\u2019s room. That was the last straw. No one wanted him in the car on the way back so my friend bought him a greyhound bus ticket and the group abandoned him 300 miles away from home.\n\nHopefully this is the bottom he needs to pull himself out but I don\u2019t hold out much hope for him. I feel really bad for my friend who invited him. I know it wasn\u2019t easy for him to send him packing. I also feel bad for our AIRBNB host. I checked his room later, the sheets were wet. I\u2019m pretty sure his pissed the bed.\n\nSorry about the language and the rant. Just needed to vent. TLDR; Raging alcoholic exposes himself to a party on a road trip, puts hands on me and gets voted off the island 300 miles away from home.\n",

   "selftext": "I'll try to make a very long story as short as I can...(warning, wall of text. Mostly me just ranting and trying to look at the BIG picture. But god bless anyone that makes it through it! Have a great day!) \n\n\nI'm almost 50 and have been an alcoholic for 25+ of those years. The last 5 have been progressively worse, were in drinking a 12 pack of high point beer every weekday and double that on any given weekend day. I got fired from my job for drinking at work and my gracious and loving fiance had a good job, and were trying to sell the house but there's some work to do, so she told me not to worry about getting another job until we move and I would fix up the house and get it ready for sale. I had just left a stressful job, and a few month vacation getting the house ready sounded like a nice change. I think the problem started when we didn't have the money to get the materials for about 3 months... Guess what I did for 3 months? Yup, drink, alot. \n\nOnce we started the renovation I got a DUI shortly after that and lost my license.\nAbout a month after that I broke my femur bone (walking home drunk of course, since I could not drive). I was bed ridden for 6 weeks. Guess what I did for 6 weeks... If you've made it this far in my story, you got it.\n\nThe pain, and shear boredom, pushed me to drink even more. I'm not making excuses here, (or am i??) just trying to be real with you, and myself...\nAnyways, being bed rid my muscles atrophied and now I just have no energy or motivation to work out and feel like shit all the time. I stopped eating more than 1 small meal a day, if I force myself to, other wise I have gone 5 days without any food... Besides beer, if that counts. It has calories so that's how I justified it, but I'm seeing now I was just enabling myself... Is that even a thing?! \n\nSo that's the \"short\" version of what brought me to you kind folks. \n\nCURRENTLY: I have developed an extreme anxiety towards heights, to the point i where I can't fly, go above the 2 floor of ANY building and can't drive over bridges...it sucks really bad and I'm sorry for anyone else inflicted with it. I can't sleep at nights because my brain keeps showing me images that causes extreme anxiety, sweaty palms, increased heart rate. Another poster mentioned that when he finally lost his anxiety, he missed it and his brain would trigger something to stress him out so that he would feel \"normal\". Thats messed up, and I feel greatly for that individual. It sounds like a prison, and I fear that's where I'm getting, or already at. \n\nToday sucks. Last night my fiance broke up with me, I found out she already has a new man in her life (in her defense, she's told me this would be coming if I didn't change things, so it's on me, I know this, and I'm trying to accept that.). She has been my soul provider for the last year for beer, cigarettes and weed. Well, and as would be accepted, yeah, she cut me off cold turkey on all that, and I have apparently scarred her for life and she's taking pleasure in this. I'm out of everything that's been my friend for years (alcohol and cigs :( ) I have no family or friends I can count on to help, but I'm pretty sure that's probably due to the drinking too. So, I made my bed and I'm going to have to lay in it. \n\nADDON: I never paid my DUI fine, so I currently have a warrant. I have no driving license or picture ID. And, NOW, since I didn't pay on time, even to get my license back would be almost $3k. I haven't been working your almost a year so I don't have insurance to get detox /rehab. I just drank my (ex) fiance's last 2 beers after she told me yesterday that if I touched them she was calling the cops on me and I can detox the hard way in jail, where they don't a shit what you're going through. \n\n\nTHE END GAME: No idea to be honest. I have an detox assessment in 2 days, but I don't know if that's gonna be enough to prevent her from calling the police on me when she gets home for drinking her beers (and whisky, opps). Either that, or she will just insist I get out, at which point I would, and walk to the ER of the nearest hospital, because I feel terrible. I pray none of you have ever, or will ever be here. I have no way to get out and the stress is causing me to be, apparently, self-destructive. I hate what I have become.\n\nAny input or suggestions are GREATLY appreciated. \n\nAnd anyone that made it to the end, here's a joke to lighten the mood:\n\n\nWhat'd the fish say when he ran into a concrete wall? \n\nDAM! \n\nLove ya all... Hang in there.",

   "selftext": "Hey guys, so I'm pretty much a self-identified alcoholic. I'm 22 now, and from the 19-21 I would drink most days, usually alone, far too much, and found it difficult to stop drinking once I'd started, and to go days without drinking. I've managed to mostly pull myself out of it and I'm much better than I was, although once I hit the one month mark of sobriety I always feel compelled to drink again. I guess in essence what I'm doing is regulating, never drinking more than once a month, when I do drink I now find it easy not to drink the next day, I remember how shitty it makes me feel, I don't want to wake up to that unpleasantness or do anything I'll regret. Despite being much better though, I just don't feel like I've truly kicked the stuff. Even if it is very controlled (for now) and I don't see that changing anytime soon, I just can't stay 100% sober.

   "selftext": "One of the things that made it so easy for me to continue drinking was that I never had any real consequences. I never was in jail for more than a day or so, the bank never threatened to take my house. My jobs were always more than supportive and somehow I still have all my fingers and toes.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t think about the consequences. I could think about them all day long, but if it were in my head that I was gonna drink, there was simply no stopping me. I didn\u2019t resist at all. There was no debate, no trying to convince myself it was the wrong thing to do. I never tried to talk myself out of it. All of that internal yammering was too painful and willpower doesn\u2019t existent when I\u2019m drinking. It was easier to just give in, give up, quit fighting a fight I\u2019ll never win.\n\nEven just the \u201cknowing\u201d that I was going to drink gave me instant relief. Like pouring water over an Alka-Seltzer tablet. That immediate, fizzy, bubbly chemical reaction \u2014 that\u2019s the uplifting, scientific relief I felt whenever I gave in to alcoholism.\n\nA counselor told me once that I should \u201cplay the tape all the way through,\u201d meaning that before I started drinking to stop and think about what would happen from start to finish.\n\nErm. That\u2019s not how alcoholics do. We don\u2019t have forethought before drinking or willpower when drinking. Consequences are irrelevant. We only see the next drink and never the dominoes falling down afterward.\n\nSeriously, when it comes to drinking my thought process is this: I\u2019m gonna get drunk and I don\u2019t care what happens. My house burns down? Good, now I won\u2019t have to pay the mortgage and will have one less responsibility. That may sound ludicrous but that\u2019s the kind of disconnect I\u2019m talking about here.\n\nYeah, life could taunt me with blackouts, jails, whatever but none of it mattered once the drink was on or even the decision to drink was made. I was at peace and nothing could touch me.\n\n\u2026\n\nAnd then there was that one time I walked into the liquor store door. Like I walked up to and in to the door. And then bounced backward off the glass because it was the exit and it automatically opened for people leaving. I\u2019d like to say that it was a simple mistake but really I was pretty much lit from head to toe.\n\nThe whole door wobbled and complained during our encounter. I\u2019d also like to say that I was filled with shame but any embarrassment was muffled by my drunkenness. Because drunkenness is like a wet blanket over the fire, a soggy forcefield that keeps the inferno of reality from being real.\n\nSo after solving the automatic door riddle and making it inside, two cashiers and a customer were staring at me with slight alarm. I ignored their stares and made straight for my aisle, as fast as I could while maintaining my composure and balance. Only momentum kept me walking in a semi-straight line.\n\nAnd then back at the checkout aisle one cashier was still around. He was an older, taller guy wearing concern on his face. Like he wanted to say something, to ask me if I was okay because I obviously wasn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t fit to be walking let alone driving.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t say anything. I\u2019m sure it was because working in a liquor store he\u2019d seen the likes of my kind before and learned the last thing you wanna do is confront an alcoholic when they\u2019re drunk and after more. That\u2019s like poking a bear after his honey.\n\nI don\u2019t remember what I bought from the liquor store that day, only that I made an ass out of myself and was too drunk to know it.\n\nAnyways, see: no consequences. I have a grab bag full of stories just like this were there weren\u2019t any consequences for my actions. Almost always nothing happened other than I got drunk. I was rarely even scolded.\n\n\u2026\n\nBut wait. There were consequences even if I didn\u2019t think about them. Even if alcoholism kept me out of touch with them.\n\nThere was the perpetual guilt so harsh that I would cringe, close my eyes, and hang my head. Soaked in regret for the constant humiliation I handed out to my ex-wife and then following it up with gift-wrapped sorries and promises that I\u2019d do better.\n\nI tried to be a good person when I was sober, had all the right moral and so on, but drinking drowned them all. Suffocated every shred of decency. I\u2019d be doing and say things I would never do sober. After five or so drinks I would be uncontrollably careless. I\u2019m an alcoholic so I\u2019d have twice that and then the real fun would kick in. I\u2019d say things to people that I didn\u2019t mean, completely smashed, flirting with other women, right in front of my ex-wife. Passing out at a friend\u2019s party at 8pm because my party had started at 8am.\n\nThen I\u2019d wake up plumb full of shame, anxiety through the roof. Should I say something to that dude? Do I owe that girl an apology? Most of the time I wouldn\u2019t say anything at all with the hope that they\u2019d just forget. Bu you commit enough crimes and people stop forgetting, shit stops blowing over. People start looking at you differently.\n\nAnd then I\u2019d start drinking all over again as soon as I could and it was like magic. All the guilt and shame would be washed down the drain like dirty bathwater. Alcoholics have mastered tuning out the guilt when we\u2019re turning the drunk dial to 11.\n\n\u2026\n\nI drank to get drunk from the time I was 15. The last few years I did try really, really hard, though, to keep myself in check, to keep myself from doing stupid shit. But that never happened. I\u2019d stumble around the house, fall into shit, make jokes that weren\u2019t funny. I absolutely hated feeling embarrassed the next morning. All I wanted was to drink, feel that drunken serenity and not make an ass of myself. Lubricated but not falling over if you will.\n\nThat\u2019s not something I can do though. My drinking always led me to a black hole I couldn\u2019t pull myself out of.\n\nAnd there was that piper to be paid.\n\n[Read the rest](https://tcrbang.com/?HgU) \ud83e\udd15",

A month later after watching a Dodger VS Giants game and having a couple beers I received another DUI for being too close to a cop on the highway. (Cop was clearing out traffic)\nMy court date for the second incident just happened and my PD is trying to do her best to reduce my charges. My court date for the first one is next week and I am terrified but still wont stop drinking. My mom has been really supportive but begs that I stop drinking before it ruins my life. I am a rational person who sees my problem. once I start I CANT STOP. One moment Im tipsy next thing I am seeing triple of anything. I am fully aware that my choices could have left me or anyone else dead and am ready to deal with the consequences and never drink and drive again. I have been attending AA but I feel like it is not for me, it felt like church to me and I am not religious nor do I drink as frequently or to the extreme of the people around me. I drink once a week because I have school all morning and work all night (I am a bartender where drinking on the job is not allowed) I never crave the taste of alcohol, use it as a coping mechanism, or drink by myself I just know that when I drink its never within moderation. I always thought I am drinking like any other college student (22) but hard to make my case with two DUI's. I am a chemistry major and will continue my education despite my fall backs but would you call me an alcoholic? Does my urge to keep drinking with friend and coworkers on my time off make an alcoholic? I got into this legal trouble and everyone around me is judgmental claiming they see a problem while they still get blacked out every weekend.  I just feel lost. I went to AA on my own will before any court dates, I have gone out and refused drinks, have even been DD the past couple of weekends which I am really proud of but the one day I went out and got drunk with my coworkers and now my friends are using that as an example of me being an alcoholic?? Should I stop drinking to prove something? I want to learn when to tell myself to stop but can't seem to find help in that area it is either stop drinking or you're an alcoholic. \nThanks for reading this mess. ",

I can\u2019t get past 90 degrees and neither can the physical therapy team.  Surgeon  said the x-rays \u201clooked good,\u201d no problems with the implant. Said scar tissue buildup was the issue. \n\nAt most recent appointment (May 23) was prescribed stronger pain meds to take especially before PT sessions, which are now increased to three times a week. No improvement, even with new meds can\u2019t get results. \n\nMy leg hurts a lot. I try not to take the pills as I am afraid of getting addicted (my mother was addict and father an alcoholic).  I\u2019ve tried cannabis (legal here) but it makes me dizzy and really does not touch the pain. \n\nI can\u2019t spread the 3rd, 4th and 5th toes on my left foot and still have numbness on the sole of that foot. My left foot sometimes drags, and catches on things, which hurts and makes me lose my balance. I am still waking with a stick, mostly to prevent falls. Still can\u2019t get up out of a low chair without help. \n\nI regret ever having the surgery. Angry that I can\u2019t do the things I enjoy. Frustrated that it won\u2019t get better. Dragged down by constant pain. \n\nMore on point, I really don\u2019t know what to do. Second opinion? Keep trying with PT? Cry (ok I already do that).  \n\nLooking for any suggestions. \n\nEdit: first pain med was oxycodone (5 mg quick release) Second is dilaudid. I also take lisinopril for high blood pressure 40 mg at night. ",

   "selftext": "Male. 34, 220lbs+, 6'0, white american. I've sprained both ankles a couple times over the years, all playing basketball. They all healed up withiin a few weeks. Ill add I was at the heaviest I'd ever been in my life and have since lost about  20lbs, now at 195-200. No current meds. Non smoker, 5-6 alcoholic drinks/week. Clean medical history. Living in Washington state.\n\nThis one however, continues to prevent me from jogging more than a few steps nearly 4 months later. When it first happened I literally crawled to the ER room from my car the next morning. The xrays were negative and the doctor told me that the swelling and pain I indicated meant it was a grade 2-3 sprain and would be better in 10-12 weeks. I did do RICE the first 3 weeks religously and was sent home with a boot and crutches, which I used for 4 weeks. I then went swimming to keep my ankle loose and a hot tub for 15 minutes, 3-5 times a week. Ive since stopped doing this about 3 weeks now after not seeing much improvement.\n\nVisited a second doctor that told me to stop wearing a compression sock/brace on my foot everyday and to ditch the mountain boots that support my ankle. \n\nSo I stopped doing both and have been wearing tennis shoes. Still cant take those first steps out of bed each morning without limping. Still cant jog more than a few steps and I'm starting to become scared thinking I will never be able to play basketball again. I typically walk to and from work (about 4.5 miles roundtrip) and my ankle is of course sore after the morning walk but not after returning home in the evening.\n\nAny tips or help is greatly appreciated, even if its just \"go to PT\".",

Then after one alcoholic drink 3 weeks later the pain was so severe I was sent to hospital with a fever, tachycardia and blood present in urine. At hospital I was diagnosed with a left kidney infection however there was only ever any sign of infection in my blood and not in my urine, which doctors couldn\u2019t explain.\n\nPrescribed Trimethoprim 200mg 2x/day for a week and various painkillers, even morphine didn\u2019t cover the pain. When the pain was at its worst it was a deep, sharp throbbing sensation that came back every other minute or so. Kept in hospital for 5 days as the fever kept coming back and I was waiting on an ultrasound, which did confirm that I had had an infection in the left kidney despite having felt pain on both sides of the inner waist during this time. Again there was no sign of UTI like stinging urine or anything, only that I was peeing more frequently than normal though this could be because I was drinking a lot of water due to dehydration (despite a saline drip). I have also never had a kidney infection or UTI before so this is new to me.\n\nAfter being discharged and finishing the 7-day course of Trimethoprim I was still feeling pain on both sides and had a fever one night but this passed and doctors confirmed the infection had gone so couldn\u2019t work out why I was still feeling pains. Prescribed Buscopan to relieve spasms but again this never covered the pain.\n\nI have been relatively pain free until now, a month after being discharged and 1 month 3 weeks since first feeling pains at all. I have been going out for drinks twice a week though kept this to a minimum (3 pints a night) as the doctors had told me there would be no reason that alcohol should cause the pain or lead to kidney infection. Not drank since the weekend and I\u2019m still feeling pains, though not severe at all I\u2019m slightly worried as I move abroad in two weeks and don\u2019t want further complications when there.\n\nThe pain is on both sides of my inner waist again and sometimes a bit higher up and round the back of my abdomen. I have a doctors appointment booked for Thursday however thought I would post on here as I never have much luck with doctors and wanted a second opinion if possible. What confuses me is that the pain was only ever brought to my attention after an alcoholic drink and that it is still present over a month later, it feels the same as it did when I was discharged from hospital so isn\u2019t severe but it\u2019s definitely there and I take Tramadol regularly which doesn\u2019t even get rid of it. I am also fatigued a lot of the time and need at least 10hours sleep, though this could be linked to my chronic pain issue and has just been something I have had to deal with for years now (I am not anaemic and blood/urine tests they did they never said anything looked abnormal except the high white blood cell count that indicated infection).\n\nIf anyone has any idea of what this could be, as I know an infection in both kidneys at the same time is rare, and it seems to only have presented symptoms after a drink one night, then I would be very appreciative! Sorry this is so long!",

Yes, it's nice not misplacing my car all the time, and it's nice not having my bank tell me that liquor stores are 98% of my \"discretionary\" spending, and it's nice not choosing drinks based on which ones hurt the least when you're puking them up again, and it's nice not going into a bar only to discover they already banned you, and it's nice not pretending to like idiotic craft beer dudebros, and it's nice not smuggling the empty bottles out to the garbage every night so your neighbors won't know you're a bum (spoiler: they know). \n\nOn the other hand, sobriety has brought my other issues into sharper focus.

   "selftext": "that AA \"ruined their drinking.\" In a way, I can totally agree with this statement. Granted, I've largely managed to achieve sobriety on my own/with the help of Allen Carr/SD/innumerable failed attempts at enjoyable moderation, but abstinence is abstinence at the end of the day. Because I was a \"problem drinker,\" however, and not an alcoholic, I decided that I would allow myself to continue to drink during certain social engagements, with the added caveat that if I saw it getting out of control again, I would recommit to total abstinence. What I've found is that even when I have allowed myself to drink on rare occasions over the past few months, alcohol has failed to produce the effects that it once did. Or well, it \"can,\" but only if I'm willing to undo all the thought processes I've established to get and stay sober, in an effort to \"enjoy\" it. Is any of this making sense? Long story short, it's not really worth it at this point to give in to the craving, and or make \"exceptions\" because it's like I know too much; the jig is up, I've seen the man behind the curtain and he's a total bummer.

With support of self, friends, family, not to mention the inspiration I\u2019ve found in this site it will hopefully be the last. \n\nFast forward to last weekend. I was asked by my brother last summer to be the best man at his wedding in Lexington, KY. The heart of bourbon country. For many years, it had been a dream of mine to visit the distilleries one day where they made my poisons of choice for the last two decades. Each bar, restaurant, hotel lobby, etc had more bourbons on display than I had ever seen.  The groom and my wife on separate occasions caught me glancing at the back lit bottles of brown temptation as I watched drink artists drop perfect ice blocks into think bottom glasses before they poured.  There was a yearning for a former self each time, but every trip to the bar, every order from the wait staff, I was able to udder the words \u201cDiet Coke with lime please.\u201d  Without any liquid courage, I physically shook with nerves when I gave my toast to my man and his new bride.  I was a little sad when I asked the crowd to join me in the toast, and my hand held cold soda.

   "selftext": "So whenever I drink, I am always destined to throw up, experience intense dizziness, and usually extreme discomfort. Now I know this is normal if anyone drink a large amount, but I have puked after only 3 drinks many times. My most recent time drinking I had about 5 drinks and went through the worst physical sensation I have ever experienced. I was feeling fine, when suddenly the urge to puke hit me. Which as I said is fairly normal. And usually after I vomit I feel better and quit for the night. This time was different. I kept puking and puking until my stomach was completely empty, but then continued to dry heave for about an hour straight. During this time period I experience intense naseua and dizziness, and felt extremely uncomfortable. One thing that helped was the breeze outside to cool me down. Then about a half hour into this ordeal the most concerning symptom happened. My hands began to go numb and tingly. I am not usually one to resort to going to the hospital because I know a lot of the time you can ride drug induced stuff like this out, but the thought began to cross my mind. \n\nSome facts about me: I am 19, about 135 pounds, 5'10.5, and drink about twice a month (usually I never exceed 5 drinks).\n\nFor awhile I chalked it up to just having a really weak tolerance combined with low bodyweight, but this incident made me consider if I had some allergy or intolerance to something. I assumed that it was all in my head and I would always puke just because I disliked the act of drinking and my body rejected it, but I don't think placebo is capable of making my arms and hands go numb like that. \n\nAlso I have never been black out drunk for any of the times I puked because my body would always reject the alcohol before I would reach that point.\n\nWhen I looked up my symptoms they matched alcoholic neuropathy. But I'm kind of hazy on what that is. Is that something brought about by drinking for many many years? I have only been drinking for 1 year and never in large quantities.\n\nI feel I must have something wrong with me that my body does not like alcohol.\n\nAlso before anyone preaches to me I have decided to stay away from alcohol completely for a long time.",

   "selftext": "After a blackout binge on Friday, where I did some pretty shameful things and possibly lost a good friendship, I admitted to myself that I've lost control of my drinking.\n\nI've been a high functioning alcohol (ab)user for years. Usually binging 2-3 days a week (3-5 strong drinks). Other than a beer belly and lots of hangovers, I never noticed much of a problem. After the 2016 election, my drinking picked up to 3-4 days a week, but then in April of 2017 I started a new office job and reduced my drinking to 1-2 days on the weekend. In January I moved to a neighborhood that didn't have a bar scene and was really busy with work so I had maybe one or two drink the whole month, and didn't notice any withdrawal. In February I lost my job, so I went to Mardi Gras with a bunch of friends and binged for about a week. After Mardi Gras, I cut back to 3-5 drinks a week until April when I came back to my hometown where the dominant social activity is binge drinking, so about 3-4 nights a week I've been having 3-5 strong drinks. Last week, I drank at least 3-5 drinks every day including one night of 6-8 and Friday, when I blacked out, I probably had close to 20 drinks.\n\nFriday was my last drink. I didn't think I was physically dependent at all since I'm so \"high functioning\" and limit my drinking to socially appropriate hours and settings, but by Monday afternoon I was extremely irritable, had a racing heartbeat and felt like I was having a panic attack. I went to the hospital and they gave me 1mg of Ativan and sent me home recommending a detox facility \"if I felt like I needed it\". I went to the detox facility and they said I could stay there but there was nothing they could do for me since I wasn't presenting any symptoms and had no alcohol in my blood. So I went home. I felt a little bit anxious in the evening but nothing terrible. When I woke up this morning I felt great! Better than I've felt in a long time. But by the afternoon I felt anxious and irritable. I went for a run which helped, and then took 250mg of magnesium which made me really tired. By the evening (now-ish) my stomach is feeling really tight from anxiety and I had a brief moment of panic. It's been ~90 hours since my last drink.\n\nIf it's just anxiety as a result of not drinking, ok. But I've never experienced trying to quit and having any withdrawal symptoms before, so I don't know what to expect. Is withdrawal still potentially dangerous at this point? Will the anxiety increase or decrease over the next few weeks? Are there any medical steps I need to be taking?",

He is dealing with some family issues that are causing issues for his own sanity. I discovered yesterday  after we went for a drive with some friends 3 empty absolute vodka bottles in his car under the seat.. thinking  nothing of it I just laughed thinking he just had a crazy evening idk. Today he gave me a ride into work ( we work together) as soon as he walks in he gets pulled into the office &amp; we all hear screaming and yelling between him and the 2 managers on duty. After about 20 minutes we see him leave the store and he messages my work group chat \u201c I got fired \u201c. Knowing he was devastated I suggested we all go out after work. I called him confirming details that we all meet in the evening. 3 hours later I get a call from his gf that he had been arrested for drunk driving and that he was in the drunk tank. I have never been so shocked in my life. She called us since she was in a meeting to see if we could check on him at the station. My friend and I drove there to check up but no answers other than he is very drunk ( 5x the legal limit )and they couldn\u2019t release him until he was \u201c sober \u201c. I had a strange feeling all day that he couldn\u2019t be trusted to be alone because this job meant a lot to him and in addition to that I found out that his gf said he has alcohol issues. Anyways hours later he had been released and messaged his gf acting like nothing happened. He doesn\u2019t know that I know all of these things. But I am just wondering how can I help him out ? I know he is an alcoholic and has severe depression. I know he was drinking because he was upset, I just want to know what I can do without pushing any boundaries because I feel this dui is a cry for help. I am glad he didn\u2019t die or kill anyone from this incident. \nAny advice would help \nThanks ,\nFlower boy ",

I believe I am an alcoholic, so I stopped drinking 40+ days ago to  get myself ready for my boy when he arrives.\n\n Tonight, after feeling like life ain't worth living for most of this time,  I decided I was going to go out and drink. By going out to drink, I mean go drink alone at the park. My wife knew I was going to drink, and she basically told me if I left I won't come back. I left anyways, and am here drinking beers at the park by myself. I am about to be a father in 0 &lt; x &lt; 7 days, and I feel that I'm a selfish piece of shit not ready for fatherhood. \n\nTo be honest, I still don't think I feel the realness of being a father. Sure, I have seen the bulge in her belly, but still I still don't think I've grasped *fatherhood*. I don't think I've got what it takes and actually feel the baby night be better off without me. I'm mentally unstable. I feel so sorry for my wife and I. I never meant to create a life, I was only fulfilling urges. I love my wife and she loves me. But can I be a good father?\n\nI don't believe I can. I want to provide financially my baby and wife, but I cannot. I want to provide mentally for my baby and wife, but I don't believe I can. \n\nI feel like a complete loser. I cannot provide shit for my family. What gives me the right to call myself a father? I'm financially weak, mentally weak. Tonight, after going 40+ days sober, I drink alone at the park by my house. \n\nI want to be a good father and husband, but how can I when I feel like complete shit every day? I cannot provide my family with a mirage.",

Motivation lowered, I did not apply my routine and I relapsed. BUT I said to myself: this is not the end, just a tiny stepback, get your shit together and work more to achieve your dreams. Three days later, the bad effects of the relapse have vanished. Confidence is back, clear mind is back, the routine is back.\n\n**So remember folks: If you relapse, don't be hard on yourself !**\n\n\\- Relapsing once is not a real issue. Sometimes it happens like with every other addiction; use your willpower to get back on track in a matter of days, and if you do so, you will continue improving.\n\n\\-Do not go on a full porn marathon after you relapse. Maybe you're thinking \"well, fapped once, may as well spend the whole day with it, eh\". No no no don't do that. This is where you will really lose all your benefits. It's like being an alcoholic: One glass of wine is not too dangerous; emptying the entire bottle is.\n\nThank you for reading, and stay strong ! Best wishes from France !",

Trying to, and unsuccessfully, not cry because the only person I could blame for any of it was ME. My actions, my consequences. My stupidity making my life harder. And yet, I got home, took some deep breaths, ate some bacon and had a puppy pile until I fell asleep. I did not drink. I wanted to. And I didn't. \n\nThis is big progress for me.

My cousin is nearly 40 years old with two school aged children. She's battled alcoholism and other things throughout the years and has quite a hefty track record with the policy. Our family is pretty dysfunctional and defaults to the \"if we don't talk about it, it doesn't exist\" method. At this point, my cousin is rail thin, rotted teeth and extremely delusional. She believes \"they\" are tracking her and has become quite reckless. We all believe she is in danger to herself and others. She's already been through the system and our grandmother has asked us not to involve the police. They are located in Central California and I am on the other side of the country. We don't know what to do or where to reach out to for help. I think that if we don't do anything, she'll end up in jail, which may not be a bad thing. I know we'd all like to see her get better though. This current decline has happened rapidly, and I know it's a matter of time before she does something really crazy. (Crazier than she's already done.) \nAt this time, she doesn't have the kids and she's not allowed at my Grandmother's house. All of us are at an impasse on what we should be doing. \nDo any of y'all have any resources of places we can contact in California to see what our options are? \n\nThank you!!",

   "selftext": "I hope I don't get too rambling and long, I'll try and keep it short enough. I just want to get my story off my chest and let go so I can move forward. I want to forgive myself and I'm feeling so much shame and embarrassment right now.  \n  \nI have been drinking all of my adult life. I started at around 15 with my boyfriend who could get alcohol from his older friends. We drank on and off socially and on weekends together. I eventually graduated and moved to college, rooming in the dorm with my best friend. I chose what college I went to based on the fact that the boyfriend (a year older than me) had gone there. Best friend and I had a difficult time making friends and therefore stayed in our room and drank constantly. Thus began my foray into serious alcoholism. I missed a number of classes and was getting even more depressed than I had been. I had a number of issues, including some sexual abuse from a boyfriend at 14. I had turned all my hate inward and was self harming pretty frequently.  \n  \nSix months into college I overdosed on Tylenol and went to bed. The next morning I was vomiting what felt like pure acid. I called my parents who asked my roommate to take me to the hospital. I was in the ED and the nurse who took care of me was condescending and even after giving me the antidote nonchalantly said \"Well, you could still die from this.\" I was hospitalized overnight and my parents came and took me the 2 hours back home. I withdrew from school. I never was hospitalized inpatient for my suicide attempt.  \n  \nWhen I got back home I spent the next few years doing just over minimum wage jobs and feeling sorry for myself. Depression was at a critical level and I contemplated suicide a lot. I gained a ridiculous amount of weight and ended up over 300 pounds. At 5'5 I felt like an elephant. I hid my alcoholism from everyone. Drank in my room alone.  \n  \nDuring this time I met some people on Craiglist, met a number of guys online. I was manipulative and a terrible person for a while. I broke a number of hearts and had my heart broken a number of times. All of it boiled down to my self hatred. I took it out on everyone else, especially when I was drunk.  \n  \nEventually, I realized I had to do something about my weight. I had not been able to be compliant with a diet and my parents were supportive so I got a weight loss surgery. As I started to lose weight, I gained confidence. But what I didn't realize is that because of the smaller stomach, alcohol now hit me faster and harder. I spent a decent time sober, met a guy who was great, and lost a bunch of weight. Until I decided I was ok to drink again.  \n  \nThe next few years were marred with alcoholism. The guy stayed with me and supported me through it all. All the nights that I drank so much that I puked and then drank more. When I quit my job in a hangover panic. When I came home from work sobbing every day because of depression and anxiety and then turned to the booze again. I became a verbally abuse drunk. I have always been empathetic, which was great when sober because I could really help people, but terrible while drunk because I could really dig hard at people. I have always known what buttons to push and for some reason I am very articulate when drunk. I also blacked out constantly. I'd have no memory of how bad I treated people.  \n  \nI ended up getting sober for a year. I was sick and tired of it all. I thought I was at rock bottom. He and I moved away from my hometown, I got a new job I enjoyed and things were great. But we were not great. In this time we had grown apart, or I had grown apart. We became more like roommates than lovers. Best friends but not in love. At least, I wasn't in love. I started drinking again.  \n  \nI met another man, who I had known for a long time. I regret this to this day, but we had an affair. I never told my guy, but I left him because I didn't think it was right and I felt such tremendous guilt. He was such a good man and I was so wrong. I started drinking very heavily again after leaving due to the guilt and shame.  \n  \nI have hit rock bottom now. I am still with the man I had an affair with and he is a wonderful guy too. Supports me through everything. Lets me live with him. Forgives me for black out making drunk decisions that are awful. I spiraled to the point where I drove drunk, something I promised myself I'd never do. I bought little wine bottles and would drink them when I got 5 minutes from the house so that I could hide my drinking. He knew me enough to realize.  \n  \nOver the weekend I embarrassed myself in front of his family and his sister's family. I then proceeded to get mad at myself, sit in the bedroom and punch my legs. I woke up hungover, painful and depressed. I have little money due to compulsively shopping while drunk. Am in a stupid amount of debt at the moment. But I started sober yesterday.  \n  \nThis got way too long, but the point of it is, I am not that person anymore. I am my sober self. I have done it before and I can do it again. I have been hiding in my room due to shame (We live with his family atm because I need to pay off debt and save money). He spent all day yesterday with me making sure I was ok. He watched over me while I slept last night because I was having bad dreams. I told him to tell his family about my alcoholism and to apologize for me. He did and said they seem ok with it. They are not very formal and conservative as my family.  \n  \nI'm still ashamed. Not sure if I'm leaving the bedroom today. But I am sober. I have a job where I can eventually pay off my debt. I have a guy that I adore and that loves me enough to help me get through this. I will not ruin it this time. I will not hurt anyone else. I will not hurt myself. I will get through this journey to self love and forever sobriety. I am myself today.  \n  \nIWNDWYT  \n  \nIf you made it through my story, thank you. I appreciate the listening ear and shoulder to lean on.  ",

   "selftext": "Hi - I have typed up countless \"this is my story\" posts (often while drunk) and deleted them the next morning without posting. I've lurked on /r/stopdrinking for YEARS - knowing my drinking habits were unhealthy while watching the habit of 4 beers 3x a week grow to 16(!) beers 6-7x a week. \n\nInstead of writing a huge novel, I'll just admit nothing I experienced is new to this group. I did all the same stuff (hiding drinking, juggling stores, progressively drinking more, breaking every rule I set for myself). I'm going to listen for a while and contribute where I can help - reading others' experiences definitely helped me.\n\nI started 2018 with a solid 47 day sober streak inspired by poor blood work from my annual physical. During that streak, I had begun to experience (and really ENJOY) all the great things I read about - better sleep, feeling of being present, less bloat - but a Friday night after returning from business trip and \"eh, what's a couple glasses of wine\" turned into 2 bottles and a six pack. The chains were off and I was back at it until I took down 24 beers alone on Monday while just doing nothing. I'm simply just tired of feeling like I've been in a car wreck day after day after day.\n\n**My plan for this week**: just stay busy. I saw a 3 hour movie in the theater yesterday, I'll either help my gf unpack her new apt or see another movie tonight. My immediate plan is to just get days stacked, feel more 'normal', and then begin to progress elsewhere in life. After this week, I'll start filling evenings with the gym again (finally!).\n\n**Support**: I've shared where I'm at with my best friend who is happy to help out but will also serve as somebody not to let down. I have a colleague in recovery in a 12-step who also is supportive. Finally, I'm going to post and comment in here for a bit just to keep this front and center.\n\nWell darn - I promised not to write a book but I did, oops! Looking forward to getting healthy and supporting eachother together with you all!",

   "selftext": "Let me ask you a question. Why do you drink? Is it because drinking makes you full of life and outgoing? Maybe you love the way it makes you feel about yourself, or how it tastes, or smells. Could it be because it makes your life better than you ever imagined it could be? No. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. If that\u2019s the case, then why are you trying to get sober? You\u2019re trying to get sober because alcohol has messed you up. You feel bad about yourself. You can\u2019t stand how you feel when you drink. You hate the taste. You hate the smell. You hate looking at it. You want it out of your life, but you don\u2019t know how to do it. Does that sound like you have a love for alcohol?\n\nYour conscious mind knows that alcohol is bad for you, but you keep dumping it on to quiet it. What you\u2019re really trying to do is to quiet your subconscious mind because it has all of those problems that you told it to store, and now it\u2019s getting full. The bad part is that your subconscious mind is a lot smarter than you are, I\u2019m talking about *you* as your conscious or thinking mind. You think that you\u2019re behind the wheel but couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Your subconscious brain is telling you and your body that there is a problem in the form of anxiety or at this point, even cravings. It doesn\u2019t crave alcohol at all, it needs to let out all the shit you told it to bury. At some point it wanted to release some of the feelings or emotions that were building, but you weren\u2019t ready, so you drank. Just this once, no big deal. You put it off for a while, and when it wanted to come out again, you drank. You did this over and over until your body could not live without alcohol. Now you feel like you *have to drink* just to get through the day or certain situations in life. When the hell did this happen? Your mind and body have become so anxious that the thought of not having a drink scares you into a panic. You start shaking and realize that you\u2019re not the one controlling your body anymore. Your subconscious mind is now controlling your body but the only thing you\u2019ve fed it was sadness, depression, bad advice, and alcohol. You have not dealt with your issues for so long, that the subconscious mind can no longer store them, and your thinking mind is not equipped to handle all of the things you were storing. Another drink? You don\u2019t need to focus on your drinking problem to fix it. You already hate the way you feel when you drink. We went over this a few sentences ago. Drinking has already made you feel like your life is ruined. You don\u2019t want to drink, that\u2019s why you\u2019re in recovery. No, you don\u2019t have a drinking problem. You have a *YOU* problem. That\u2019s what needs to be fixed. You.\n\nAt some point, when you\u2019re ready, you will have to take the time to take care of what owns you, because you sure as shit don\u2019t own IT anymore. This thing that controls you is the monster that you built. You created this by not dealing with things as they came. And guess what. It\u2019s probably not your fault. Somewhere along the line, you weren\u2019t taught the life skills you needed to deal with the smallest of problems, so you had no idea how to deal with the biggest of problems. Don\u2019t beat yourself up! The same thing happened to me. This is our weird existence and it\u2019s amazing when we start to take action by looking into ourselves because we have a conscious mind. Sometimes we just have to clean out the attic. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you. Nothing that can\u2019t be fixed. You\u2019re a human being that used the wrong medication because you feared some of life\u2019s problems. You may have been a toddler when you learned how to bottle something up that scared you or made you angry.  \n Put your hand on your heart. Do you feel it beating? That\u2019s not you that is making it beat. It\u2019s your subconscious mind that\u2019s controlling all of the functions of your body, including your nervous system, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it. The problem is that you aren\u2019t willing to let out all of the bullshit you\u2019ve put in there for the past however many years because you\u2019re scared and anxious. But your subconscious mind doesn\u2019t know what to do with all of the problems that you stored in it, so it can\u2019t function properly which means it\u2019s not controlling your body the way it\u2019s supposed to. Now you\u2019re sick. Now you\u2019re worried even more because you\u2019re sick. Do you see the cycle? Why would you focus on the act of not drinking if you already hate drinking? That\u2019s going to amp up your anxiety to 100 and make recovery nearly impossible. Any good psychologist will tell you the same exact thing. Don\u2019t believe me? Great! Ask one, or hand this to a hundred psychologists \\(for objectivity\\) and see what they say. \n\nThe first thing to know is that you\u2019re going to be okay. You must trust that you\u2019re going to get through all of this because not trusting it will make it much more difficult. The second thing is, to do whatever you can to let out the things that are stored in a healthy manner. Exercise, mediation, learning about what makes you a healthy human, and even meetings or a simple but deep conversation with a friend. Here\u2019s where I think AA is fine, but only for a short period of time. When or if you go, really try to listen to the pain that alcohol has caused people. Listen to all the mistakes people have made and all the damage that they\u2019ve done to their lives. Be compassionate and feel their pain because they\u2019re about to feel yours. I would encourage you to speak so you can hear yourself telling a story that you wouldn\u2019t normally tell. Do this with people you trust as well, it will help put things into perspective. Remember that these people at meeting are strangers, and that they\u2019re going through the same thing, so don\u2019t be shy about your story. Make it count when you go because you don\u2019t want to be the guy or girl that hangs around for fifteen years and comes because they\u2019re addicted to meetings instead of alcohol. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that person per say, but I\u2019m willing to bet that you didn\u2019t have that on your list of *what I want to be when I grow up*. So make this temporary. Being addicted to meetings can be hard on the mind. Here you are, barely able to deal with your own problems and you want to live in the problems of others? No, you don\u2019t. Use AA as a reality check from time to time. As the saying goes, everything in moderation. People want *you* to be miserable with *them*, so try not to make this your anchor. It\u2019s a strange part of human nature. Meetings should be used as a tool to help you feel again, not as a lifetime anchor that never lets you leave. \n\nYou might not believe it, but you\u2019ve been burying feelings, and holding them down for so long that your emotions will either hide or come out in an excessive and unhealthy way. Neither one is normal. It\u2019s science! Hiding what you\u2019re feeling will work against you 100&amp;#37; of the time, because you don\u2019t give yourself the ability to deal with what\u2019s bothering you. There are healthy ways to have emotions, and getting angry, or covering them up by getting drunk are not the way to do it. I cried, and I also laughed at random times while I was meditating. I was able to let myself just be and not wrestle with the oncoming emotions. I just let them out as they wanted to come. Don\u2019t judge yourself and don\u2019t wrestle with your sadness or fears, it\u2019s not helping. I gave my emotions zero resistance and just let them flow without judging any of them. I didn\u2019t know exactly where they came from all the time, but it didn\u2019t matter, I was just letting go. Each time I did this it felt like 100 pounds were lifted off my shoulders and the only thing I did was just let it go. Don\u2019t just concentrate on the stupid things you did while you were drinking, but instead let yourself feel how scared you were when you decided to quit, then work backwards from there. Each time a memory pops up, don\u2019t try to fix it or wrestle with it, just let it do it\u2019s thing and if you get scared, that means that you\u2019re on the right track. You\u2019re only scared because you didn\u2019t let yourself be afraid before, your body is learning how to deal with it. Don\u2019t worry, *you\u2019re safe as long as you\u2019re not drinking.* Surround yourself with people that truly love you. Sometimes you may find out that someone you thought loved you, really doesn\u2019t. Sometimes people want us around because our problems make their problems seem smaller, thus your pain made them feel better about their own lives. These people will tell you things that actually* go aga*inst recovery, just so you don\u2019t pass them up in the happy department. They will use your pain, suffering, and bad decisions as an anchor for their own ways of dealing with their own problems. Those people need to either support what you\u2019re doing, or they have to go. You\u2019re trying to get healthy! You\u2019re not trying to make a healthy person feel better about themselves. These will be the same people that call alcoholism a disease but are against treating it with medicine. \n\nSpeaking of medicine, if your doctor prescribes pills like Xanax or Klonopin, it\u2019s time to find a new doctor. Benzodiazepines are ALCOHOL IN PILL FORM and will mess you up like never before. I was prescribed these medications when I first got sober for three years, and when I tried to quit using them, I had seizures. Again\u2026 not normal. That is your body literally kicking and screaming telling *you* that what *you* are putting in *your* body is BAD, and it doesn\u2019t want it. But that\u2019s just science talking, not me. Look it up. Thousands of studies have been done on better medications, and most of the ones that work without harmful side effects come from the ground. They are always natural and healthy ways to help you recover quickly and safely, and they\u2019re becoming more available \\(or legal\\) every day. Bill Wilson, the founder of AA, used LSD and psilocybin mushrooms to help him recover from alcohol. Why don\u2019t people know this? Probably because there\u2019s not much money in it. It\u2019s not a ridiculous conspiracy theory, it\u2019s just a fact of life that you can either change or accept. It\u2019s 100&amp;#37; up to you. Just like your life and what you do with it.\n\nDon\u2019t listen to me, listen to yourself and google what\u2019s healthy and makes you feel good. Become a vegetarian or a vegan. Go the other way and get on the carnivore diet or a ketogenic diet. News flash: It\u2019s up to you to do what makes your body feel good. A year after I stopped drinking, I finally ended up doing a keto diet and cutting out sugar and processed carbohydrates because alcohol also processes as sugar, so I didn\u2019t want my body to operate like that anymore \\(science\\). I wanted my body to burn off the stressed fat and function properly. Would you like to know what happened? Great! I\u2019ll tell you. I lost over 50 lbs. in a little over four months and my body stopped craving alcohol because I\u2019m burning fat instead of sugar. There was no need to crave it anymore because my body was functioning properly. I even wrote a book about it because it works so well. Diet plays a huge role in recovery, so find one that\u2019s right for you. The placebo effect of changing your diet alone is healthy. Do you want to struggle with alcohol or would you rather be more concerned about how to be healthy and how to live longer? Now your focusing less on not drinking and more on life and how to live. There will no doubt be people that disagree with what I\u2019m saying, and that\u2019s fine. You can do your own research and find out that I\u2019m making sense.\n\nThis got a little long, so I\u2019ll end it here for now. Just know that there are plenty of ways to recover and it doesn\u2019t take a lifetime to do it. Thanks! Have a POWERFUL day! ",

   "selftext": "Let me ask you a question. Why do you drink? Is it because drinking makes you full of life and outgoing? Maybe you love the way it makes you feel about yourself, or how it tastes, or smells. Could it be because it makes your life better than you ever imagined it could be? No. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. If that\u2019s the case, then why are you trying to get sober? You\u2019re trying to get sober because alcohol has messed you up. You feel bad about yourself. You can\u2019t stand how you feel when you drink. You hate the taste. You hate the smell. You hate looking at it. You want it out of your life, but you don\u2019t know how to do it. Does that sound like you have a love for alcohol?\n\nYour conscious mind knows that alcohol is bad for you, but you keep dumping it on to quiet it. What you\u2019re really trying to do is to quiet your subconscious mind because it has all of those problems that you told it to store, and now it\u2019s getting full. The bad part is that your subconscious mind is a lot smarter than you are, I\u2019m talking about *you* as your conscious or thinking mind. You think that you\u2019re behind the wheel but couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Your subconscious brain is telling you and your body that there is a problem in the form of anxiety or at this point, even cravings. It doesn\u2019t crave alcohol at all, it needs to let out all the shit you told it to bury. At some point it wanted to release some of the feelings or emotions that were building, but you weren\u2019t ready, so you drank. Just this once, no big deal. You put it off for a while, and when it wanted to come out again, you drank. You did this over and over until your body could not live without alcohol. Now you feel like you *have to drink* just to get through the day or certain situations in life. When the hell did this happen? Your mind and body have become so anxious that the thought of not having a drink scares you into a panic. You start shaking and realize that you\u2019re not the one controlling your body anymore. Your subconscious mind is now controlling your body but the only thing you\u2019ve fed it was sadness, depression, bad advice, and alcohol. You have not dealt with your issues for so long, that the subconscious mind can no longer store them, and your thinking mind is not equipped to handle all of the things you were storing. Another drink? You don\u2019t need to focus on your drinking problem to fix it. You already hate the way you feel when you drink. We went over this a few sentences ago. Drinking has already made you feel like your life is ruined. You don\u2019t want to drink, that\u2019s why you\u2019re in recovery. No, you don\u2019t have a drinking problem. You have a *YOU* problem. That\u2019s what needs to be fixed. You.\n\nAt some point, when you\u2019re ready, you will have to take the time to take care of what owns you, because you sure as shit don\u2019t own IT anymore. This thing that controls you is the monster that you built. You created this by not dealing with things as they came. And guess what. It\u2019s probably not your fault. Somewhere along the line, you weren\u2019t taught the life skills you needed to deal with the smallest of problems, so you had no idea how to deal with the biggest of problems. Don\u2019t beat yourself up! The same thing happened to me. This is our weird existence and it\u2019s amazing when we start to take action by looking into ourselves because we have a conscious mind. Sometimes we just have to clean out the attic. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you. Nothing that can\u2019t be fixed. You\u2019re a human being that used the wrong medication because you feared some of life\u2019s problems. You may have been a toddler when you learned how to bottle something up that scared you or made you angry.  \n Put your hand on your heart. Do you feel it beating? That\u2019s not you that is making it beat. It\u2019s your subconscious mind that\u2019s controlling all of the functions of your body, including your nervous system, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it. The problem is that you aren\u2019t willing to let out all of the bullshit you\u2019ve put in there for the past however many years because you\u2019re scared and anxious. But your subconscious mind doesn\u2019t know what to do with all of the problems that you stored in it, so it can\u2019t function properly which means it\u2019s not controlling your body the way it\u2019s supposed to. Now you\u2019re sick. Now you\u2019re worried even more because you\u2019re sick. Do you see the cycle? Why would you focus on the act of not drinking if you already hate drinking? That\u2019s going to amp up your anxiety to 100 and make recovery nearly impossible. Any good psychologist will tell you the same exact thing. Don\u2019t believe me? Great! Ask one, or hand this to a hundred psychologists \\(for objectivity\\) and see what they say. \n\nThe first thing to know is that you\u2019re going to be okay. You must trust that you\u2019re going to get through all of this because not trusting it will make it much more difficult. The second thing is, to do whatever you can to let out the things that are stored in a healthy manner. Exercise, mediation, learning about what makes you a healthy human, and even meetings or a simple but deep conversation with a friend. Here\u2019s where I think AA is fine, but only for a short period of time. When or if you go, really try to listen to the pain that alcohol has caused people. Listen to all the mistakes people have made and all the damage that they\u2019ve done to their lives. Be compassionate and feel their pain because they\u2019re about to feel yours. I would encourage you to speak so you can hear yourself telling a story that you wouldn\u2019t normally tell. Do this with people you trust as well, it will help put things into perspective. Remember that these people at meeting are strangers, and that they\u2019re going through the same thing, so don\u2019t be shy about your story. Make it count when you go because you don\u2019t want to be the guy or girl that hangs around for fifteen years and comes because they\u2019re addicted to meetings instead of alcohol. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that person per say, but I\u2019m willing to bet that you didn\u2019t have that on your list of *what I want to be when I grow up*. So make this temporary. Being addicted to meetings can be hard on the mind. Here you are, barely able to deal with your own problems and you want to live in the problems of others? No, you don\u2019t. Use AA as a reality check from time to time. As the saying goes, everything in moderation. People want *you* to be miserable with *them*, so try not to make this your anchor. It\u2019s a strange part of human nature. Meetings should be used as a tool to help you feel again, not as a lifetime anchor that never lets you leave. \n\nYou might not believe it, but you\u2019ve been burying feelings, and holding them down for so long that your emotions will either hide or come out in an excessive and unhealthy way. Neither one is normal. It\u2019s science! Hiding what you\u2019re feeling will work against you 100&amp;#37; of the time, because you don\u2019t give yourself the ability to deal with what\u2019s bothering you. There are healthy ways to have emotions, and getting angry, or covering them up by getting drunk are not the way to do it. I cried, and I also laughed at random times while I was meditating. I was able to let myself just be and not wrestle with the oncoming emotions. I just let them out as they wanted to come. Don\u2019t judge yourself and don\u2019t wrestle with your sadness or fears, it\u2019s not helping. I gave my emotions zero resistance and just let them flow without judging any of them. I didn\u2019t know exactly where they came from all the time, but it didn\u2019t matter, I was just letting go. Each time I did this it felt like 100 pounds were lifted off my shoulders and the only thing I did was just let it go. Don\u2019t just concentrate on the stupid things you did while you were drinking, but instead let yourself feel how scared you were when you decided to quit, then work backwards from there. Each time a memory pops up, don\u2019t try to fix it or wrestle with it, just let it do it\u2019s thing and if you get scared, that means that you\u2019re on the right track. You\u2019re only scared because you didn\u2019t let yourself be afraid before, your body is learning how to deal with it. Don\u2019t worry, *you\u2019re safe as long as you\u2019re not drinking.* Surround yourself with people that truly love you. Sometimes you may find out that someone you thought loved you, really doesn\u2019t. Sometimes people want us around because our problems make their problems seem smaller, thus your pain made them feel better about their own lives. These people will tell you things that actually* go aga*inst recovery, just so you don\u2019t pass them up in the happy department. They will use your pain, suffering, and bad decisions as an anchor for their own ways of dealing with their own problems. Those people need to either support what you\u2019re doing, or they have to go. You\u2019re trying to get healthy! You\u2019re not trying to make a healthy person feel better about themselves. These will be the same people that call alcoholism a disease but are against treating it with medicine. \n\nSpeaking of medicine, if your doctor prescribes pills like Xanax or Klonopin, it\u2019s time to find a new doctor. Benzodiazepines are ALCOHOL IN PILL FORM and will mess you up like never before. I was prescribed these medications when I first got sober for three years, and when I tried to quit using them, I had seizures. Again\u2026 not normal. That is your body literally kicking and screaming telling *you* that what *you* are putting in *your* body is BAD, and it doesn\u2019t want it. But that\u2019s just science talking, not me.

   "selftext": "Sorry for Text wall, I am using this as a diary entry. \n\nThis was a good run this time boys. I had a 14 day streak this time around and it was much easier without weed. I have hit 154 days before and I know I can do it again with significant effort. \n\nI have stopped smoking in order to pass a drug test I will have to pass for medication. I noticed my daily activities were bringing me more joy, and I could live by doing the manual labor around the house while listening to Tim Ferris, my favorite podcast. \n\nAs a work from home entrepreneur it is difficult to get going some days. So I try to help out my friends as much as possible to get out of the house as the saying here goes, \"being home alone is like sitting at the bar not ordering a drink for an alcoholic\".\n\nI just finished a semester of Computer Information Systems, with straight As and have been learning more and more about /r/theRedPill as it takes everything I used to learn in /r/seduction and applies it on a inner level instead of outside. I feel its the difference between actually changing your mindset and putting a face mask on.\n\nOne of my best friends purchased a new house so I helped him start to move in. This consisted of researching new 4k TVs, finding a TV mount for a 75 inch TV, mounting ceiling fans, putting bed together and other general stuff. My friend is a personal trainer and we hit the gym together(so thankful!) so during this time he was taking a break from the gym so I stopped going too. I kept up my protein intake to 200g with supplements to minimize muscle loss.\n\nI was completely fine for about 5 days. Then I started an old habit of mine back up, eating candy at night. It starts with the diet mountain dew for 97 cents at circle K. I would get these for what I noticed quickly became everyday again for 3 days. Then I started adding skittles, then I started adding the starburst on it. I would scarf these down while watching self-help/business youtube videos and playing video games at night. My bedtime started getting later and later, again to 3am. My wake -up time started to suffer again, 6am, 8am, 10:30am, noon, then eventually 2pm.\n\nThese were bad things but, I still have my nofap streak, right? Now, I stopped leaving my smartphone in the living room, started bringing it into the same room as sleeping. I need it for my bedroom chromecast, right? I want to pause my show and don't need the thing running a show fromthe living room to the bedroom..... Started to shut off my alarm clock and bring my smartphone to early morning bed with me. \n\nStarted Tindering in the early morning, before meditation. This will make you desperate and get frustrated. Now spending this time, home alone, 2-3 hours in the morning just surfing the smartphone, desperate for a high quality woman with morning wood. This is a terrible combination. I started edging to Tinder(OMG this is terrible) and instagram (OMG this is worse) and eventually edged over the top. At least I haven't looked at porn, right?!\n\nAfter whacking off about 3 times to non-nude photos then the porn peeking starts. I knew it was wrong I would open tabs on the smartphone and close them momentarily each time spending more and more time on nsfw content. Started PMO again. \"I can fix this\". \n\nThen yesterday, I couldn't help it anymore binge binge binge. 4 times. It was Tuesday, Trivia night and free games at Dave and Busters. I went to Rasing Canes with my Japanese Exchange roommate (delicious) and we started watching the Walking Dead with our Chicken tendies and Texts Toast. I filled my head with so much dopeamine that I didn't feel like going to Dave and Busters to meet new people anymore, \"I have better video games here\" I think to myself. \n\nThis is when the crippling depression kicked in. Here I am, barely making ends meet, scoring a 4.0 GPA in school yet, unable to get a scholarship because i am a white male. Denied from another 10 jobs this week due to my job history of CHOOSING to be an entrepreneur, unable to get past a Human Resources robot. Getting kicked out summer school for late payment and failure to lay down my credit card. \n\nCalled my girl, she was struggling too. Went over, helped her out, at midnight, fucked her but not to her satisfaction from PMOing 4 times that day. \n\nBam, life hits you at a million miles an hour. You see the slow wind up, you think its fine, I haven't been hit yet. Then it will all hit you in the same day. The instant gratification of dopamine instead of the spits of it fromaccomplishments will leave you into a meatbag. \n\nHere is is day 1, woke up at my girlfriend's, conveniently near school. Went to admissions, got the information I need to re-enroll in summer school. Emailed my professors, my friend says he is going to start lifting again today, and no excuses,  I am going to go. Getting back on the horse boys, got my protein intake to 100 grams merely after breakfast and I am ready to tackle the day. \n\n",

   "selftext": "I gave up drinking 6 days ago. \n\nQuick info on me: M24, wife, two kids (3 &amp; 4).\n\nI'm not sure if I would have been considered an alcoholic, but I would drink 3-4 beers almost every day for the past few years. Didn't ever get drunk unless I pounded them. I read mixed things online about it. I figured I would be better off mentally if I considered myself an alcoholic..the thing I never wanted to be.\n\nI've been struggling with really bad acid reflux for a few years now. That is magically gone. I haven't taken any Tums in 6 days.\n\nI used to have BMs like 5 times a day. Now its only 1 or 2.\n\nI quit drinking the other night because I had some realization after I finished my 4th tall boy that there was no reason for me to be drinking. I kept asking myself why I felt the need. \n\nI also take depression medication which specifically says on the back to \"not drink any alcohol.\" So I don't even think my medication has been working correctly.\n\nAlcoholism is pretty bad in my family. My dad broke that cycle though. His dad actually drank himself to death.\n\nWhy did I drink? Well stress probably. I liked the way it made me feel numb to the world after coming home from work. It is a lot more fun to play video games while drinking. \n\nI thought about trying to \"wean myself off\" but I figured that I wouldn't be able to follow through with that. \n\nI've been dealing with the boredom by doing homework before its due rather than doing it last minute..which feels awesome. I have been trying to spend more quality time with my wife and kids as well. \n\nSparkling water has also helped me a lot.\n\nAm I done with alcohol completely? Probably not. But I will be for a long time. At least until I know I have enough self control to only get one IPA at the bar every once in a while. I plan for a minimum of 6 months, but I honestly don't really have a minimum. I just want to see how it affects my body and get out of the habit of drinking so much. I really do enjoy a good IPA, but I figure there are more important things in life to worry about than beer.\n\nI'm going to get my brother to stop drinking as well. I told him about it already, but he is in Ireland at the moment with his wife so I told him to go ahead and enjoy himself while he is there.\n\nI just wanted to say thank you to this subreddit for giving me enough reasons to stop drinking. I honestly probably wouldn't have done it without you guys. Reddit has been my go to now for a few years for ANY question or problem I have. I like seeing real people's responses to real life issues.\n\nThanks again, guys/gals. I appreciate you all.",

I don't put them on the table, I don't physically take the bottles out, just reach in to take off the caps, then take the pills. Then the librarian comes up behind me questioning me about them. I show her the pills are in my name, I tell her they are very important for my health, that I have to take them at specific times, and that I have the proper paperwork in with the school for them.

   "selftext": "Hey SD.\nJust curious: how do you typically handle telling new people about your non-drinker status without making it a big deal or making things awkward?\nI've recently dipped my foot back into the dating scene and it's a bit intimidating to say the least -- especially now that I don't have my liquid-courage/anxiety-easer.\nAlthough I don't have issues with wanting to drink on first dates (or subsequent ones), I *am* struggling a bit recently with how to communicate my sobriety to potential dating partners without being a buzzkill or shooting myself in the foot.\nAs an example: a girl who I went on two successful coffee dates with just suggested another date via text. Great, right? However \"I wanted to try some summer wines. Maybe I'll bring a couple bottles over for us to try?\" was her suggestion. I went ahead and told her that sounds lovely, but that full disclosure, I don't really drink these days -- and that I absolutely don't mind when others do.\nShe has yet to respond, so now of course I'm doubting my response/approach.\nSo basically...what I'm saying (long-windedly) is: I don't want to give someone an earful about my being sober (that they likely don't even care about), but I also don't want to hide anything or mislead anyone.\nAny hot tips for this over-thinker?

I am 23, female, and my dad is alcoholic.\n\nWe have a pretty rough relationship due to abuse when I was a teen because of his drinking. I've been on and off no contact with him for the past several years. But lately we have been doing fine, and he's been sober for about 6 months.\n\nVery unexpected, but I guess he started drinking again within the last few days. I just called him up today and he is drunk to oblivion. I don't know what triggered it. To my knowledge, nothing important has happened in the last few days.\n\nMore to the point, I just am not sure what to do. I just got off the phone with him after asking if he needed help and telling him to call me if he does. His health is very poor. He's really damaged his body with all of the drinking. I'm always really concerned during a relapse that he will just die alone in his house. But I also can't go over there and take care of him. I just can't. It brings up too much trauma from when I was a teen. It puts too much stress on me and I'm not willing to do it.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do?

   "selftext": "Hi r/stopdrinking, longtime lurker here, wanted to make an introduction and a celebratory milestone post. \n\nI crammed a lifetime of moderate drinking into six brutal, lonely, alcoholic years. 500 days ago I was suffering a hangover and the most crippling shame I've ever felt. I couldn't even hold myself up on my own two feet--not a metaphor. I could barely stand, I could barely breathe without feeling like I would crumble. I was on the cusp of losing the love of my life, and I felt like I had lost myself a long time ago. I knew I had to make a change.\n\nIt hasn't always been easy. The past year-and-change has brought me a new, lifelong diagnosis, new and painful confrontations with my past and new struggles that I can't (won't) drown out. But the worst day now is infinitely better than the best day of my drinking. I also have new things to celebrate; countless little miracles of being present--most of all that I'm becoming someone I actually like. My love and I will celebrate ten years together next month. The difference is night and day. \n\nI'm so grateful this sub exists. For my fellow lurkers, wherever you are on your journey, know that you're not alone.

A few examples of me noticing this would be when I\u2019m having a totally shit day and no one wants to talk me through my apparent depression. I\u2019ll explain one thing before i go further, I must be constantly happy for them to be around me. I cannot change, or atleast it feels that way. I\u2019m their rock, but who\u2019s mine? I have a Psych and meds and a diagnosed disorder along with some other things, but I want people who i don\u2019t have to pay. People who want to do it for me, who I can depend on, who will be there for me through it all, who won\u2019t say the bullshit like \u201cit gets better\u201d. *eye roll*. I have friends who feel like they are capable of doing so, but i\u2019m 75% sure they\u2019re just creating that illusion. \n\nMy parents are also like walking on eggshells. Saying one wrong thing will lead to what i feel is emotional abuse and torture. This is where I feel i\u2019m going INSANE. My mom will come into my room at 2am telling me in my sleep what a shit human being I am and degrading my very existence. Naturally I wake up in the middle of this rant, but pretend to be asleep. But since i am in a sleep filled haze, i can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s my own mind or if it actually happened. ITS DRIVING ME CRAZY. and since my mom is intoxicated during, she\u2019s an alcoholic btw, she doesn\u2019t remember it in the morning and acts like everything is normal. My psych has told me no, this is not normal for my mother to act like this. \n\nMy father is also abusive, but emotionally more than physically. \n\nit\u2019s only been a few times? yeah. \n\nbasically, my emotions feel invalidated, I\u2019m paranoid to the max with my friend drama, and i don\u2019t feel like i\u2019m capable of being here anymore. \n\nthere\u2019s more\n\nso much more that I want to say. \n\nbut i\u2019m done screaming, and ready for the silence.

   "selftext": "Hey sobernauts.\n\nI posted here about a week back, just after finishing my last binge. I want to start off by humbly offering my thanks to everyone who reached out. This sub has been amazing, and I look forward to visiting every day. Anyways, here are some of my reflections this wonderful, sober period.\n\nThe first time I quit was back in August 2017. I was presented with an ultimatum by my girlfriend: either I stop drinking, or she leaves. Pretty straightforward, right? And it was, for about seven or eight months, albeit with white\\-knuckled grit. I started it out with an AA\\-meeting, but then never returned for a second \\(red flag, anyone?\\). It wasn't that I didn't enjoy it, but I figured I didn't need any help. If I decided to do this, then I would do it. No AA, no SD, no rehab, no shrink, no support whatsoever. Then after a while, something magical \\(i.e. defying all logic or reason\\) happened.\n\nI suddenly thought, 'Well shit... I'm not an alcoholic, am I? I can control myself *now,* right?', and for some reason and in spite of all empirical evidence pointing the other way, I imbibed that lie. Then, the worst possible thing occurred the first time I had a drink again... I actually **didn't** get blackout drunk. That confirmed the illusion; I was *back,* baby! I rationalized that it had only been my depression\\-period that had caused me to drink. It had been because I was in disarray, and because I had been anxious and in bad shape. I saw that all these aspects of my life were improving now, so I could obviously drink again! I never stopped to think, thoroughly, about *why* life was improving... but deep down, I did know. Somewhere, submerged in endless layers of ego, arrogance, self\\-deceit and selfishness, I did hear that muffled voice.\n\nAnd I disregarded it completely.\n\nAs you can imagine, it went downhill from there. Now, my girlfriend might leave me after my terrible binge at a bachelor's party in Poland... and I wouldn't blame her for a second. Again I had it proven to me that when I drink, I erode the building blocks of my life. Inevitably, pieces of this structure must crumble and collapse under the pressure. Inevitably, I must lose part of who I am sober to accommodate who I am drunk.\n\nI was, in other words, bitch\\-smacked by reality. I was hungover for almost a weak, and in an emotional and spiritual crisis. There was this terrible dissonance between who I wanted to be, and who the demon of alcohol turned me into when I drank. Gradually but undeniably, drunk\\-me has become more brazen, more aggressive, more manipulative and, in general, more of a contemptible sonofabitch. It's a well\\-documented and familiar pattern for many alcoholics I've spoken to; like drunk you gets more comfortable in your skin... like everything becomes more and more about *him* \\(or her\\). It almost seemed like this alter ego was doing everything in his power to destroy my life, and destroy all the things I had worked so hard for... and I was letting him. But I refused to let that happen, and resolved, through tears of anguish and remorse, to quit. Again.\n\nThen I ran, or rather fled, to the first AA\\-meeting I could attend. Then I went to another one the next day... and then the day after that. This time around, it felt like I was coming home... like I had found a bastion of strength. Some of the members remembered me from last time and smiled, 'It's always so wonderful when people come back.' That was it. No judgement, no shame, no condemnation. Just genuine relief that the prodigal son \\(and sadly, there are many of us\\) had returned. And I finally realized... I'm actually powerless. I have *actually* lost control of my life. I can never hit harder than my alcoholism, and so I have to hit better. I need to be tactical. I need to surround myself with people and resources that can remind me what terrible course I would be set upon if I had that first drink. Something clicked in me, like my life flashed before my eyes. I resonated with every story, every shared regret, every signal of hope. I'm only 24, and I've never  broken the law or been in jail \\(which is just pure luck\\)... but I've done some things that the shame of which nearly ate me alive. The pain and regret that permeated these stories is what struck a familiar cord with me, and so I could relate. It almost didn't matter what they'd done, because I knew that if I continued to drink, I would always stoop to a new low. And then I realized something else...\n\nThe person I am when sober has ambitions and desires. I want to be a good man, I want to be a father, I want to be a person people can trust and be safe around. But I am also terribly insecure, self\\-loathing, hard on myself, constantly full of shame and extremely anxious. This, coupled with a huge pride, arrogance and bloated ego make for an ungodly synergy I call 'fuck\\-you\\-and\\-your\\-self\\-insight'ness. It has caused me a lot of trouble, and I think it has driven me back to alcohol many times and hindered me in seeing the truth of my alcoholism. And, as if on some terrible vendetta, drunk me has always tried to vehemently *prove* to me how terrible I am. I do things when drunk I know I wouldn't even enjoy sober, and if there was an inkling of a chance that I might \\(on some base level\\), then it would still be in conflict with who I want to be and thus, not be worth it.\n\n\"See? You manipulated that girl to sleep with you. You don't care about love, you're just a superficial dick.\"\n\n\"Remember all those nasty things you said last night?\"\n\n\"Hey, that bus ride. You were a cocky asshole who made everyone's life miserable.\"\n\n\"Can you believe you spent all that money on a strip club? Lol, you're an asshole. Now go drink.\"\n\nIt becomes this self\\-fulfilling prophecy, and I fell for it time and time again. My alcoholism dripped into every aspect of my person. The demon came out when I drank, sure, but I didn't consider how it left a sucking chest wound in me even after the hangover had passed. This self\\-doubt... this terrible \"knowledge\" that in reality, no matter how well I do at work or what people say to me, I'm a monster undeserving of any praise or love or, least of all, forgiveness. It wasn't even directly related to my drinking \\- it was just a general notion that I was a fucked up human being that didn't deserve *any* of the good things in life. And life... well, that was slowly being sucked out of me, and I couldn't even see it for the lie it was.\n\nPaul Hedderman \\(thanks to u/sovietcableguy for sharing this gem with me\\) compares alcoholism to a parasite. It can't drink on its own accord, so it relies on the host \\(me\\) to drink for it, so that it can live *through* me. The best way for it to ensure its survival is to convince the host that it itself is the host. But I realize now that the things I've done while drunk... it's not me. It's some malformed, simple, perverted shade of me, but it isn't me. I don't want to let that demon hijack my life anymore. I'm not willing to let him sit at the wheel anymore. But finally, I realize, that I can't do that alone. If I fight alone, all this energy will eventually be co\\-opted and turned on me, and I will drink again. As one of the AA\\-members at a meeting I attended said, 'Nobody around this table lacks willpower. In fact, you probably have more than most... that's not what makes us drink.'\n\nI am powerless. And that's okay. Understanding that has been the most liberating thing I have ever experienced... and becoming free from the demon; reclaiming the ship, is now my foremost objective. If I don't, I will lose everything \\- my life included. I don't intend to perish like *that*.\n\nIt's time to get better, and to be honest about it. I'm ready.\n\nHope you guys have an amazing day, and for all our sakes, IWNDWYT.\n\nP.S: Sorry for the absolute wall of text \\- I had a lot on my mind.\n\nEDIT: Formatting",

We have none in the house and really can't afford any. I can't not go.\n\nTo top it off younger sister accused me of \"mansplaining\" and \"it doesn't matter what gender they are, just that I'm a guy.\" And yelled at me when I told her I was upset about it. Okay.\n\nI have to be at this thing in two hours. My urge is to just act as white trash as possible because I know older sis will join in, but I'm gonna have to be a bit mature than that.",

   "selftext": "QUICK NOTE\nAnything in brackets is just more of a backstory to situation, not Necessarily completely relevant so feel free to skip those parts \n\nRight so basically I\u2019m a 19 year old black male living in England,  I was born in Zimbabwe and my family is all from Zimbabwe so I know even though I\u2019ve lived in England for 17+ years that I\u2019ve got to respect some traditions, but as I\u2019ve gotten older some things just don\u2019t appeal to me tradition wise and I don\u2019t do them, \n\n(for example respect your elders, I respect anyone who gives me mutual respect, I don\u2019t believe age should determine respect, like don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019m not a the sort of person to disrespect anyone because I didn\u2019t get the amount of respect I believe I deserve, I just mean to say if your older and disrespect me, I won\u2019t be nasty or horrible I just won\u2019t give you as much respect as you gave me)\n\nMy mother is very religious (Christian) and of course doesn\u2019t believe in sex before marriage. I\u2019ve been dating this girl for about 1 year and a bit, I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re in this for the long run and get more serious. So my mother doesn\u2019t like the idea of her staying over at the house, even if we were to sleep in different rooms which I suggested she still was not having it, I think this is down to religion and how she was raised in Africa which completely different to how life is here(England)for a teenager who\u2019s been with someone for a year, so my girlfriends mother is English and allows me to stay over at her house in the same bed as my girlfriend, and my mother knows this and knows we have gotten intimate before.\nSo I can\u2019t have my girlfriend stay over at my house and my mother tells me it\u2019s not because she doesn\u2019t like the girl it\u2019s just because of her values and morals from how she was raised and she pushing that on me. \n\nSo as like any teenager would, I\u2019d sneak her into the house sometimes when my mothers not home and we would have a few drinks (alcoholic) and just enjoy each other\u2019s company, (my mother is not a fan of drinking either and lectures me about it a lot, I believe it\u2019s just a bit of fun we\u2019re not drinking everyday or hurting anyone, plus I\u2019m going to uni September and it\u2019s typical English uni culture to drink and party, have a good time while your still young). So my mother has caught her in the house a few times when she shouldn\u2019t be there, because we can\u2019t always be staying at her house and drinking there, although her mother is more relaxed about drinking, my mother hasn\u2019t said anything to her directly but has threatened to kick me out before and sometimes inflicted physical punishments, my girlfriend knows my mother doesn\u2019t like me drinking and knows she\u2019s my mother doesn\u2019t want her in the house over night but doesn\u2019t understand why. \n\nShould I try to reason with my mother that I really like this girl and we should try to compromise that my girlfriend can sleep over every so often, and il be in another room, and we won\u2019t drink either, or should I keep doing what I\u2019m doing without getting caught till we both go to uni together?\n\nThis also raises the question, do strict parents like my mother who didn\u2019t let me drink at all cause bad children, for example she doesn\u2019t want me drinking ever, but knows I have a few times and is very unhappy with me, just from like bottles of bud being left in my room, never actually seeing me drunk. Like the fact I couldn\u2019t drink made me want to even more, and have been trying to get alcohol at 15 years old for house parties and stuff, where other parents just buy it for them because they know we\u2019re just young and trying to have a good time. Like my friends who\u2019s parents let them drink and bought them alcohol for parties and stuff aren\u2019t alcoholics just guys having w little fun. But my one friend from a struck Asian family lied to his parents about going on an college trip to get drunk for the first time and got really drunk as it was his first time and almost ended up in hospital. Do you think it\u2019s better to introduce your kids to responsible drinking than not letting them drink at all, because eventually they will drink at one point in there life anyway ",

   "selftext": "Hello my friends. To say that I am nervous, if not terrified, is a statement that does not do justice to how I'm currently feeling. Every fibre of my body is telling me that I should not post anything. However, I feel that it is imperative for me to bare my soul in the help that somebody help there has felt, or is currently feeling, the way that I do now.\n\nAlcohol can be a wonderful thing. Over the years it has given me confidence, provided me with a greater social presence, and has at times made me the life and soul of the party. For a while, I felt that gave me a fresh perspective on things, and because of this I thought that I could write better, live better, relax easier and be someone that I always wanted to be. As long as I had a drink in my hand the world was my oyster, and there for the taking if I should so wish. \n\nAs grandiose as that sounds, it didn't take me long to realise that such a perception was merely temporary, and it wasn't long before I realised that the path that I was treading led to an extremely dark place. \n\nAlcohol didn't make me a better person, it made me a nightmare. It turned me into an individual of whom I did not recognise, and because of this the perception that certain people had of me was either false, inaccurate or totally ridiculous. I was a fool, masquerading as comedy-fodder whilst misinterpreting such behaviour as being 'cool' or 'rock'n'roll' (You'll have to forgive such language for I was very young). I experienced periods of waking up in the morning after a heavy night and breaking out into worry over what I did the night before. What did I say to so and so? Why did I send that text? Why did I behave in such a manner? This would haunt me until the time would come where I would go out again and repeat the same behaviour, oblivious to the trauma of past experiences, resulting in bad memories, poor choices, and a broken heart.\n\nI am aware that I am still young (early-20s) and that I have close friends who still partake in the consumption of alcoholic beverages. I am also aware that because of this, it is going to be difficult to maintain sobriety. The temptations are everywhere, and I'm finding it difficult to block them out and carry on with my day. \n\nI am turning to you, the wonderful people of stopdrinking. Your help has been invaluable thus far, but for my sake I felt the need to post in order to garner much more personal advice.\n\nI will not be drinking with you today.",

I am not worried about drinking but one of my friends said she doesn't really think I am an alcoholic at all and I was laughed at when I said that I couldn't drink Kombucha (because they think it has such low alcohol content that it doesn't matter). It really hurts my feelings when people say things like that to me. Did I lose everything from my drinking? No. Did I drink every day and stop going to work or get a DWI? No. Who are people to judge what my alcoholism looks like? If I sit down at a bar by myself and can't have more than 1 even though I planned on it, if I drink obsessively to get rid of an anxious feeling and then end up feeling like ending my life, or drive drunk and just don't get caught...isn't that enough? Why do I have to prove why I can't drink? Kinda mad about it...kind of trying to let it go. Thanks all! ",

   "selftext": "Headed to a Celebration of Life this weekend for a fellow alcoholic. He lived for about a year after his diagnosis. Probably one of the toughest situations I\u2019ve encountered in my years on this planet, I think because it hits so close to home. This easily could be me everyone is going to gather to remember. He was so optimistic up until the last couple of times I saw him, so much hope that he would get on a list and get a new liver. I hate to say it but this experience has hopefully been good for me, I have now witnessed someone I know die from the addiction I have. That sounds just as terrible in text as it did the first time I thought it. IWNDWYT",

   "selftext": "This is kinda rambly, I just wanted to share it with you guys.\n\nI prepped a patient today who was going to get a defibrillator implanted.  Nice guy.  I had taken care of him last week when I picked up a shift in ICU.  History of alcoholism, substance abuse, was positive for tricyclics upon admission.  Not detoxing or anything, just a nice, soft spoken dude.  When the team lead was going over the list with me yesterday she mentioned the tricyclics thing, along with how he had freely admitted to abusing some kind of over the counter thing, I can't remember what it was.  She said it with this kind of brief widening of her eyes, as if to say he was going to be trouble.  She mentioned the tricyclics with this tone of well you get what you deserve.  I assured her I had taken care of him and he was a nice guy and wouldn't be any trouble.  It bothered me though.\n\nSo today, he and I are waiting for the OR team to pick him up, and we get to talking.  He tells me he is an alcoholic, has been sober 13 years, and had been going to AA twice a day lately.  He says he enjoys that he can sometimes help other people when he goes to meetings.  He tells me his wife divorced him due to his drinking but lately things had been better, and she had even kissed him the other day.  He tells me he really wants to get completely clean and is going to try really hard once he gets out of the hospital.  He was in the Navy.  Used to be in marine sciences.  Enjoys writing, said he liked to write funny stuff because he liked making people laugh.  He was a complete, flawed, and genuine human being.  Full of pain and remorse and hope and self awareness and sweetness.  I told him I was about five months into my latest attempt to get and stay sober.  We talked about how nice it is to share stories when you're trying to stay sober, and how important it is to find people to share those stories with.  I really enjoyed talking to him. \n\nI go and sit down at the nurses station, and my coworker immediately starts ribbing me, implying he was full of shit, that his alcoholism meant that he had brought his heart problems on himself.  Which, ok, duh.  That can be true, substance abuse can mess with your health.  It probably is the reason he needs a defibrillator.  But he said it in a way that was so lacking in any kind of sympathy or depth.  It was like they could only see that he had a history of substance abuse, without any regard for how he had gotten there, or where he was now.  It was like it didn't even matter that he hasn't had a drop in thirteen years.  And it made me so angry.  When do you stop being judged for who you were in the past?  I know it doesn't matter what other people think, but it seems so cruel and small to take this entire person, this real person, who was so excited that his ex wife had kissed him last week for the first time in a long time, and reduce him to nothing but a lousy drunk.  People suck sometimes.",

   "selftext": "Hi. I am finding that 2 to 3 days without alcohol is when the extremely vivid nightmares and auditory hallucinations start. I am ready to be done with alcohol, and so while me and my boyfriend were on vacation, I had quit for 3 days. Then, the nightmares started, and the auditory stuff (some scary shit) (this isn't the first time I had quit, so I wasn't shocked). I had to fly back today and he will fly back saturday, and even without all this withdrawal crap I can't stand being alone in our creaky old house. So I drank some again, but I really didn't want to. I'm just scared of withdrawal. Should I wait til he gets home to stop? I have heard it is dangerous to stop on your own (it killed my uncle in a horrible way), but I am serious about the quitting thing. I'm actually there, it's just this one hurdle. Please let me know if you've had experience with this. I'm pretty frightened, but I do not want to miss work by going to a hospital or something...how would I explain that? I'm in a professional position, with a lot of responsibility, and no one there knows about my drinking. \n\nEdited to attempt a bit more clarity. Sorry, guys, was reading back through and I sound pathetic. I'm just scared, because I have not gone 3 days without drinking in...a long time. Like, I cant remember when. The 3 day mark has always hit me with weird shit, and now I'm alone, so I dont know what to do.\n\nEdited to say thank you for the responses. I will contact my GP to get her recommendations on where to go. I think my worry stems particularly from my uncle who died from this very thing. Not a drop of alcohol found in his autopsy, but he stopped on his own and went crazy and died alone. This week, during the sober days, I had a glimpse of what things could be like, and I dont want to die. So, thank you.\n\nEdited again: drinking tonight again to stave this off...I'm a coward, and I cant stand the thought of hearing those voices while im alone. I was hoping to pass out before dark but it didn't happen, itll be okay though. One thought I keep having tonight is that, I'm ready. I never had this before, usually it takes a hangover and a million regrets before I feel ready to give it up. Now I'm anticipating the end of drinking. I read a good book recently, how to kick the drink easily, so ridiculously titled and so 5th grade level reading, but it made me understand I dont have to miss anything about drinking. I'm eager to give this up, I saw how good it could be earlier this week, I just dont want to be scared. Does that make any sense? Thanks, random reddit people for being good folks. I'll check back in a couple days.\n\nUpdate: doc isn't in office until Monday, and other docs not available today, fine, I'll be okay, I had just a little today, I really think this tapering thing could work, but guess what, now I have some upper respiratory thing and a fever. Great timing. I'm so ready to feel better and start living.\n\nFinal edit. Doing good. Got sick as hell with a cold, so I guess you could say I tapered with nyquil. I think I got this, guys! I expect nightmares for a couple weeks but what the hell, I can handle that. Thanks so much to everybody. I cant wait to start my life again.",

   "selftext": "I'll warn you before you venture further, this is going to be a long post. I have noone to tell it to, so basically it's just you guys, I'm sorry.  \n\nAs I have mentioned in the title, I came to realize I have three strong ongoing addictions that are basically crippling my life. It took time to realize that I suffer from all three. I have been a part of NoFap community (eventhough lurking mostly) for quite a while but so far I only thought my problem is PMO.  \n\nSo now to list all three: Gaming, PMO and alcoholism. But if I was to sort them from the toughest to the easiest one it would be difficult for me because they all are strongly tied to eachother, so I just sorted them by the earliest contact.\n\nGaming: I have been playing strategic games since my very early childhood and I loved it because it allowed me to put myself into a role of a big conqueror and a leader of the bigger picture. Since I wasn't really liked in school because of my looks (ginger), I prefered to spend afternoons by the computer instead of outside with my peers. Later on, when the Internet became widespread I started playing online games and well guys, I can tell you, these games can be addictive.\n\nPMO: I have always been told that P is a very bad thing and I was basically scared to even look for it and since in my early childhood it was only magazines and late night movies in TV it was not really a problem. But when I got in my puberty years I just felt some unknown tension in my inner areas and it was kinda the same time when I got connected to the broadband Internet and this is how it started. I still didn't feel very good about it, I felt very guilty whenever I would PMO, I would confess every week or even more often, I would make myself a big decisions that now I stop once and for all but I just couldn't resist for more than two weeks. When I got to my early adult years I heard a lot from my peers that it is not anything wrong so eventually I stopped caring and let it loose whenever I could (which meant parents out of reach).  \n\nAlcoholism: My dad has been drinking alcohol in large amounts since whenever I can remember, I have been witnessing quarrels since for ever and as I saw my dad in the state he was, I got quickly drawn into the state that I would NEVER touch the alcohol because I saw what it does with people. My peers started experimenting with alcohol as early as in the age of 14 and the later it went, the harder they pressured me to join them. I was really assertive about this thing (and it really didn't improve my unpopularity situation) but I was strongly convinced it is a bad way. But once I passed 18 and it actually became LEGAL to me, I gave it a go. I didn't like alcohol at first, I started from one beer, then two beers, etc. And so I was going more and more loose at parties. Then I got fired from my studies, I felt depressed, started drinking two beers every afternoon, just to help my sleep and not think about the failure. Then three beers, then sometimes more at the weekends. \n\nSince this post has already gotten long, I'll try to get all three parts together now:  \nI am 26 years old graduated (Master of Science) unemployed boy who aims to be a programmer (but lacks experience) who:  \n* spends all his days gaming  \n* drinks beers or vodka at nights which results in feeling very bad at the next day  \n* goes PMO whenever he feels bad  \n\nTo add some more details: my first encounter with an ED was at the birthday party with a random girl: I didn't really care because I was heavily drunk but it should be an alarming singal. Then I made an unhappy relationship with a girl (I loved her, she didn't love me back) and she gave me just one chance to try sex, I failed there too. Then I tried escort, a failure there aswell. So basically I am a 26 years old virgin too.  \n\nNow, summing up, I am trying to set myself some dates to stop the addictions like: the New Year, my birthday, the 1st day of the new month, basically some day that I could easiliy follow my progress from. But I always fail that once I get put in front of some unsettling event or depressing experience, my psyche is just too weak so I escape to alcohol and PMO again.  \n\nIf I made this story hard to read, I'm sorry. My English is not that good and neither are my writing skills.  \n\nI want to stop this vicious cycle. I want to get free. How do I do that?\n",

   "selftext": "\nI started smoking at the age of 19 and in four years, I've spent thousands on it. Not having food because of weed has been a regular occurrence for me throughout this time. It makes me account for every penny others owe me and I've never stolen except over weed. Its made me lazy and its prevented me from doing the things I need to do to better my life. I was a slave to it, my life revolved around it, and if i didn't have it then finding it was my only priority. Being sober meant I was an angry, hurtful person and this has damaged my social life and affected me at work. I answered to a plant, a plant decided my life for me.\n\nAfter a year of hormone therapy and some recent heart to hearts with people who feel they are also slaves to weed, I finally kicked that shit a few days ago. I have dreams, I feel social, and I feel like I have the energy and motivation to better my life. I feel like I am free.\n\nHowever, people including my roommates just keep talking shit to my face about how I couldn't have a drug problem and how my quitting 'is stupid'. Everybody calls it a T break and asks when I'll start again. Anything I say about how my life will get better is interpreted as an insulted to them. My roommates hand me joints without a word. No one offers the recovered alcoholic or recovered heroin addict in my home that shit, but my struggles are not real because cannabis is an angel that cant hurt anyone in their eyes. Its the suffering olympics to them and they had 'real problems'. Partially I can tell they're bitter because they can't just stop smoking weed either, but it still hurts and makes me feel isolated. I didn't realize how many people would fade out of my life over this change.\n\nI posted a similar topic in another subreddit and got reamed for my stance that cannabis can be a problem, but I got linked here at least. I wanted to share my story with people who would get it. This is just day 4 but I never want to go back to that lifestyle.",

   "selftext": "\\(First post and am writing this at 2 AM\\) Well, I'm 17, \\(I know I'm probably too young to be worrying about these things\\) but here I am, kind of just doing nothing. I was diagnosed with Chemical Depression when I was in 7th grade, and I knew nothing of it... I was put on 50mg of Zoloft right at the start, and I had no idea what it was for, but then I just felt sad during 8th and 9th grade and so it got pushed up to 100mg. It still has gotten worse and got bumped to 150mg Sophomore year. For Junior year I went to a boarding school and I can tell you, probably the worst feelings I've ever had sprouted from there, and the most depressed I have ever been in my life. Junior year of High school, I did their summer session and I  frankly quite enjoyed it, I made some friends there and we all agreed we would stay the school year. I thought I was going to have a good time. The school year started out a bit slow, but eventually got worse... There were a group of students who were full of mischief there and they called themselves the Good Times Crew. They all wanted to have good times with each other I guess, but the point I'm trying to make here is that, I sort of rolled with them. One of them introduced me to a world of Drugs. DXM, LSD, Shrooms, and Benzos. I personally had no idea this world even existed at the time. I remember going to a Safeway on our bikes and grabbing a few bottles of Delsym, that got me into a whole worlds of trouble, I got hooked on this stuff right away, I know that it probably doesn't sound right at all though, and during this time I found someone that I liked there, Her name was Rose, she was pretty and had a really bubbly personality. \\(I personally had never been in a relationship, let alone had kissed a girl before so this was a start.\\) But I drove her away, and I ended up driving her away due to my social anxiety, whenever we were with other students, I just couldn't talk to her at all, I felt uncomfortable showing affection to her. This made her become uninterested in me. And I felt really depressed afterwards and led me to turn to the worst in my opinion. I remember around the time Mid\\-Terms were about to begin, I ended up feeling that I wanted to get high, and so I gathered 3 bottles of Delsym, ended up grabbing benadryl and had my roommate give me some of his ADHD medication. I ended up taking 16 tablets of benadryl and 100mg of Focalin and drinking all 3 bottles of Cough Syrup in a day. I somehow survived the night being high as fuck, It felt like I would never return to the planet, it was more of a spiritual thing than anything, but ended up putting me in the hospital the following morning, I had a panic attack because I felt like I was going to feel brain\\-dead and vegetable like for the rest of my life and that I had over done it. I told my friend that I feel like I was going to die and he took me to the headmasters office while they had some staff pull up with a van to take me to the nearest hospital. I felt like I wanted to throw myself out of the window in my room \\(I lived in the second floor\\) That's where I felt the lowest, also having to tell my parents what I had done was probably the worst feeling ever. at the hospital they gave me Ativan to calm me down, and the following day, I went home and was sent to a 3 week rehab place, this didn't help at all ofc. I had found out that this girl at the rehab place had a crush on me and her \"friends\" insisted that I dated her. I had said no several times saying I was going back to my boarding school, and they said she could do a long distance relationship, this has been my second relationship and in my opinion my most toxic one. I personally feel pathetic after this, thinking \"I'm dating someone at rehab, like what the fuck, and for the 3 weeks I was there the relationship grew, and we ended up talking on the phone when I got back to school, not learning anything from this, I decided to take some of my Dad's Valium with me to school so I could just relax instead of doing the DXM almost every weekend. This is when the Good Times Crew, we sort of exchanged drugs, they gave me psychedelics in exchange... Some trash LSD and Shitty Shrooms, I didn't feel anything on the shrooms, but the LSD was a different story, I remember having a facetime call with my roomates crush and we all talked for a while while we were both on LSD, I remember letting my emotions get to me and I told her she was a selfish bitch for saying no to him, for he had asked her out on facetime... After that went down, I sort of realized all that I had done, and I went into this depressed state of mind for a while during February, March and April, during this time, I had lost connection to my long distance girlfriend, she had run away from home her parents had told me. This made me upset because I kinda loved her... and April came along and after our spring break, my friend had brought a wax pen back to school. I remember taking a hit of hit and I felt amazing, my friend also took a hit, but he ended up greening out. He snitched on himself and had told them that I was involved, and that I had forced him to do it with me even though he was the one who brought the wax pen. This all happened 2 days before my birthday too \\(April 11th\\) on the 9th we smoked, and on the 10th we got tested and we failed. I ended up getting sent home on suspension for a week at first for smoking marijuana, but then the headmaster had told me I would need to go to a wilderness program during the summer if I wanted to come back to the school. \\(Wilderness programs are like outdoor therapy, but camping I guess...\\) and so here I am at home more than a month later. I've been trying to get a job recently and I've been through at least 6 interviews with no luck. I haven't been able to sleep lately either and a couple of nights ago, my dad gave me some Valium to use as a sleep aid instead of using NyQuil which has DXM in it, and I lied to him saying it wasn't working and he just kept on giving me 2.5mg at a time, I was at the 7.5mg point where I finally went to sleep and woke up not being able to remember what had happened the following day... and now I don't know what to do now, I feel like I'm not even going to be going anywhere in life because of my past choices, I just feel empty and numb now and I want to get off my Zoloft but I'm too scared of the withdrawals I might have. I've talked to my parents about this and they seem to support it, I'm just wondering about your guy's opinion on this too... Sorry if it feels like I'm just giving you irrelevant information because I felt like I needed to put this somewhere, I needed to explain my story somewhere...",

Connection with others is everything - connect to a sober community.\n2. Go inward, connect with and resolve your inner pieces, they are your key to connecting with a higher power. Meditation and mindfulness are helpful as hell. Move from intellectualizing and realize your conscious monkey mind is a tiny percentage of your inner resources.\n3. Learn to tolerate discomfort and impatience, and focus on doing the next right thing. This is hard. You are exercising your ability to tolerate discomfort and to move forward in the absence of immediate reward. When you do this it is like a muscle, and soon discomfort is less of a trial and you have strength you never realized.\n\nEDIT: I feel foolish, giving advice to others when I can't get it together myself. A final recommendation: \n\nIf you get sober clean/time, KEEP it.",

   "selftext": "I have heard that people react to stress in five ways: they placate, blame, intellectualize, become irrelevant, or are congruent. I can certainly identify with that, having done all of them at one time or another.\n\n\nAs the placator, I became the super-martyr, turning myself inside our to please the alcoholic. As the blamer, I laid at his feet the responsibility for all our problems. As the intellectualizer, I read books and spouted theories, well able to discuss anything in the abstract, but totally unable to cope with my real problems. And I became irrelevant when I buried my head like an ostrich, pretending our problems would go away if I ignored them. It was in Al-Anon, that I learned to be congruent: to behave appropriately and to deal with my problems instead of playing sick games. And it was here that I gained some understanding of why I'd acted as I did.\n\n\nI became a martyr and a people-pleaser because this was the way I'd learned to get praise and admiration. I became a blamer when I felt so worthless that I couldn't accept criticism or admit I'd made a mistake for fear that others would see in me what I saw: failure, ineptness, inadequacy. When it became too painful to feel because I took the alcoholic's behavior personally and interpreted it as rejection, I shut my feelings off and became a \"head\" person. That is, when I wasn't running away into fantasy because I felt so helpless and unable to cope with reality.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding myself was a big step toward understanding the alcoholic. When I looked at it honestly, I could see that we took turns placating, blaming, intellectualizing and being irrelevant. The same needs that had caused this behavior in me were causing it in him. We weren't so different after all! We did seem to find one type of behavior more comfortable than the other, though, and while my choice most the time was to placate, his was to blame. By applying what I'd learned about myself to him, I was able to approach him differently.\n\n\nI learned not to fall into the trap of defending myself or others against false accusations. That was just a waste of time, as was coming back at him with accusations of my own. I learned not to let the alcoholic set my goals for me. Living up to my own expectations was enough. When confronted with a verbal attack, I would try to stay calm and remember that it was his self-hatred, guilt, and fear of being uncovered in all his humanness that caused his need to blame. Instead of becoming embroiled in a heated argument over whose fault it was, I would try to focus on the problem itself. \n\n\n\nIt wasn't easy. I still felt angry and frustrated sometimes. But understanding the behavior permitted some compassion to seep through so that I could be less defensive and more objective.\n\n\n\n*An Al-Anon members sharing, Page 37-38 Forum Favorites, Volume 3*",

   "selftext": "So a few weeks ago I posted that I was really struggling. I basically ended up having a panic attack at work, then spend the next hour and a half wandering around a park and eating ice cream just to keep my shit together.\n\nIt was pretty crazy. I cannot believe that after 200 days- alcohol still impacts me so much. I've had some good days and bad days since my last post, but recently more bad than good. \n\nYesterday I was starting to really get down on myself. Kinda pissed that I still want to drink even though I know it will do NOTHING for me but make things worse. I've read a lot of posts in the last few days about relapse, and y'all are doing a good job of making it sound totally unappealing- but yet in the back of my head- there's that damn voice telling me to drink- just have one it says- it will be fine.\n\nI have been down on myself because for some reason, I thought I'd totally have this thing licked by now. I was stuck in this terrible loop of wanting to drink, knowing that I cant and then feeling sorry for myself that I was still craving, like I was a failure for still wanting to drink. Then I realized of course alcohol still has this much control over you- you're an alcoholic. \n\nIts funny, it took me quitting drinking to actually learn what it means to be an alcoholic.\n\nLast night I went to my second job (security work at an urban community college) and I love that place. I honestly feel like I am going home every time I work there. The people there are so real- no one is trying to be something they are not, its a place that recognizes that everyone has their share of lumps to take in life. Its so different from my day job at a polished land grant University- where perfection is made to seem as if it were the status quo. When people said told me before that academia is soul sucking work- I never realized why. Academia is a lot of putting on a face or facade of perfection- no room to be tired- no room for flaws.\n\nI have a friend at this place and he is one of the most inspirational people I have ever met. The dude always has a super optimistic outlook, despite being dealt a pretty shitty hand by the united states criminal justice system. He has been trying to get a job working on the rehabilitative/restorative side of the criminal justice system for a few years now. He's been sober and not been in trouble for 15 years. This guy has heart and passion to do good, he wants to help young guys- he wants them to learn from the mistakes he has made and how to take on the world after being labeled an undesirable convicted felon. A guy in his shoes would have every right to be bitter and hateful, but he's not.\n\nHe always inspires me. We talked for about an hour last night and he helped put things in perspective for me. We've all got problems- its something we all share, its part of being human, but we cannot be defined by our problems. In so many ways, attitude is everything.\n\nHe'll probably never read this, but thanks friend, you inspire me more than you know.\n\nTL;DR: 200 days in and there are still cravings; I am realizing there will always be cravings. A friend of mine helped me see that in adversity attitude can be a game changer.",

   "selftext": "  And if someone can explain this to me I would be grateful. \n\n\\(so rats get free booze. Wow! if I had only known\\)\n\n##### By Ben Taub\n\n03 MAR 2016, 00:00\n\nScientists investigating the role of dopamine in alcoholism have come up with some surprising evidence that may help to explain why addicts find it so difficult to stay away from booze. Publishing their findings in the [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/02/19/1506012113), the researchers suggest that when an alcoholic stops drinking, the brain\u2019s ability to use dopamine changes, altering the way that the reward system is wired.\n\nLike many drugs, alcohol is known to stimulate the production of a [chemical messenger](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21521/) called dopamine, which activates the so\\-called reward center of the brain. Previous [studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21744309) into the nature of addiction have revealed that this dopamine response is significantly reduced in alcoholics, leading to a need to drink more in order to feel a buzz.\n\nThis reduction in dopamine levels causes what is known as a hypodopaminergic state, although little is known about what happens to the brain\u2019s reward system when alcoholics try to stop drinking and enter a period of abstinence.\n\nTo investigate this, researchers began by examining brain tissue from deceased alcoholics. They found that these brains had fewer of a particular type of dopamine receptor than normal brains. Called D1 receptors, these are the sites on the membranes of neuronal cells to which dopamine binds, causing these neurons to become excited. Any reduction in these receptor sites would therefore be expected to decrease the brain\u2019s responsiveness to dopamine, thereby explaining why alcohol fails to satisfy.\n\nIn addition, these brains were found to have fewer [dopamine transporter](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/15/3/1714.full.pdf) sites, which allow for any unused dopamine to be sucked back up and recycled. So, as with D1 receptors, the disappearance of these sites is likely to hinder the brain\u2019s ability to use dopamine.\n\nThe study's authors also note that the brains of deceased alcoholics displayed no reduction in D2 receptor sites, which bind with dopamine in order to inhibit, rather than excite, neurons. All in all, this evidence explains how alcohol dampens the brain\u2019s reward center, compelling alcohol\\-dependent individuals to continually seek stimulation through booze.\n\nNext, the study authors sought to determine the sequence of events leading to this situation. To do so, they used radiography techniques to track dopamine levels in the brains of alcohol\\-dependent rats that were denied alcohol for several weeks.\n\nThey discovered that dopamine levels dropped during the first six days, confirming the existing theory that acute alcohol withdrawal is characterized by a hypodopaminergic state. Interestingly, during this initial period, the availability of dopamine receptor sites and transporter sites were found to be normal.\n\nHowever, after three weeks, the researchers noted that dopamine levels were in fact elevated, as the number of available receptor and transporter sites plummeted, so that the rats\u2019 brains resembled those of the deceased alcoholic humans. This increase in extracellular dopamine levels is explained by the fact that less of it is able to bind to receptor sites, and therefore more of it remains unused in the gaps between neurons, known as synapses.\n\nSignificantly, at the three\\-week mark, the rats displayed continued behavioral effects associated with alcohol cravings.\n\nAs such, the study authors conclude that, while acute alcohol withdrawal may be associated with a hypodopaminergic state, prolonged abstinence actually leads to a hyperdopaminergic state \u2013 meaning dopamine levels in the brain are higher than normal. Crucially, they say that both of these states are representative of a dysfunctional reward system, and therefore increase a person\u2019s vulnerability to relapse.\n\n[http://www.iflscience.com/brain/what\\-happens\\-alcoholics\\-brains\\-when\\-they\\-quit\\-drinking/](http://www.iflscience.com/brain/what-happens-alcoholics-brains-when-they-quit-drinking/)",

I was barely able to get to work from withdrawals, was horribly depressed, and couldn't see myself being sober for even 3 days.   \n\n\nNow I'm over 40 days sober and can't believe how much better everything has gotten! The constant obsessive thoughts about drinking have lessened 1000 times. I havn't even had too much of a struggle turning down a drink from people or being around a friend who is having a beer. My depression and anxiety have almost disappeared. I have started to make amends with people and repair broken friendships I thought were permanently dead. I feel like my old self again. Confident and independent. And to top it all off I just got a promotion into management at my restaurant I work at! The owner is a recovering alcoholic himself and was happy with my work since getting sober and proud of the strides I'm making with sobriety itself and so after training I will finally leave serving and bartending behind for a far more stable salary life.  \n\n\nI am truly blown away by how much things have changed in so short a time.

Its a tight rope because he can get very very mean really quickly. \n\nHes very recently started adding xanax to his nightly drinking ritual. Like, up to 3 bars. And he drives. He comes to my house gets more tanked than when he arrived and leaves while nearly black out. He hasn't remembered even hanging out with me a couple times just very recently. \n\nHe ended our friendship because he got very drunk and started an argument. He blames me and our other friend even though we were sober. He became belligerent and he left with an open container and drank on the way home. Blaming us for his decision to get even more drunk on the way home. \n\nHe just got his first public intox about a month ago. He doesn't remember anything but he says it freaked him out. Apparently not a lot. \n\nI am aware he drinks and drives and takes xanax nearly every night now. Can I call the cops? This is me scrapping the barrel. We don't know what to do. But a drunk ruined my mom and brothers life and I don't want him killing someone or himself. \n\nTl;dr (kind of) What can I do? As an alcoholic myself I am aware not a lot can be done to change our mind, we have to make the decision to get clean ourselves. But what would happen if I called this in to the police? He drives with an open container or with his bottle next to him. He refuses to believe that he is \"too drunk\" to drive. ",

   "selftext": "I'm under the impression, from some neuroscientists, mostly Sam Harris (who has a great book solely on Lying) to be honest, who I'm a big fan of through atheism and debunking stupid religious claims (only Christopher Hitchens was better at it) - that lying in and of itself is a thing that is pretty much always bad, and should be avoided at all costs, in every situation.\n\nI have to agree with that position - and yes, that means you shouldn't let your kids believe that Santa is real, you should tell them that he isn't real, and that it's you and your wife or husband who is buying the presents under the tree. (I never believed in Santa because my parents were hardcore materialists, every present I got literally had written on it \"From Mom or From Dad\") - (yes, Christmas is a big thing for non-religious people too - even though modern Christmas as we celebrate today has almost nothing to do with Christianity, it's a good old Norse, end of year booze-up after all, always was) (Christianity stole the end of year Yule festival from the Pagans to lessen Pagan power and to increase their own).  \n\nBut, I also think/know that lying is a very complex mental process and it takes a fair amount of creativity and intelligence to lie and to lie well. It's usually bad to lie, but I like to think that I'm quite good at lying. It could be because I was very lonely as a child, and making up stories/\"lies\" in my own head was a totally normal thing to do to cure the boredom.\n\nLying is usually thought of as very bad, and totally shunned by a lot of people far smarter than me in the brain science field (who say that you should never ever lie) - but I can't divorce myself from the fact that lying is a great mental exercise, and probably good for the brain - it reinforces creativity and higher brain function, is it not? \n\nWhen it comes to alcoholism - well, we've all lied quite a bit in our lives, no doubt, but would the pain of realizing the truth (I think we all have to be honest), but also having everyone in your life realize the truth, be worth it, against having them not be aware of our problems?\n\nIs lying an inherently wrong thing - or is it sometimes okay, sometimes unavoidable, or sometimes necessary?\n\nMany chairs.  \n\n  ",

Believe it or not, I *am* wearing makeup in the before picture! (Foundation, powder, mascara) My skin was just so blotchy, red, and bloated from swigging vodka in the car and drinking two bottles of wine a day!! What a life, huh?\n\nI gained a lot of weight while drinking- around 35lbs (and I'm pretty short). I used to run around 30 miles a week before I decided I cared more about drinking than I did about fitness. Binge eating and drinking went hand-in-hand for me. \n\nThe weight doesn't come off over night, but for the first time my clothes are getting looser and looser while I'm eating candy and ice cream like it's Treat Yo' Self 2018. I'm starting to get more serious about my diet and exercise (because I know it will make me happy), but for now I am letting myself enjoy my short *very* slow jogs followed by whatever snack I want. Whatever keeps me sober!!\n\nGetting sober is the best gift I have ever given myself. After multiple legal problems, crashing my vehicle, and fucking up all my relationships I didn't think there was hope for me: I was ashamed of myself. I don't feel that way any more. Even at 50 days in, I feel so damn hopeful about the future, even if it's a little scary. \n\nIf you're struggling, earnestly reach out for help and you will receive it. I personally have chosen AA, and I go every day. Being sober is so much easier when you're not doing it on your own. In AA, I've met an amazing community of people who I now call friends and feel more loved than I ever had. I don't really believe in god (atheist), but I do believe in MY god which I found in AA: **G**roup **O**f **D**runks. \n\nIWNDWYT",

I'm not trading my job in and tell myself over and over drinking isnt the answer.\n\nAbout 7 years ago my marriage went south. I was depressed and drinking lots. I would get up and anxiously wait for 12:00 so I could hit a bar. Id leave that bar at 5 and head to another bar until at least midnight. Its a wonder I didnt kill anyone. The only saving grace was when my kids would come over I wouldnt do that. It was me and kids time and I refused to sit in a bar while my kids were at home.\n\nI tried to stop but have only winded down. I can go a few days but I'm back at it again. Not drinking daily, but going a few days not drinking and then the binge drinking. Every time I regret it. Last night I failed again.\n\nI went in sat down and told myself that I would only have 2. If I could only have 2 I could keep myslef in control. The first one came and it was \"on the house\" as the keg was depleted. Suddenly in my mind that didnt make sense to count as 1 of The two. It was free.\nI had another. And another. And another. \nIt was also an Open Mic that night. I drove home grabbed my expensive Martin guitar and headed back to play.\nI had another. And another. And another and then I played. After I played I had another and even more. I closed the place. Lights out and walked out the back with the bartender who locked up. Got in my car and drove home. Yes. You can all nitpick me and tell me that driving is and was a bad decision. I know. If I keep doing this it will catch up to me.\nI was also too drunk and  left my Martin Guitar there.  Its gone as of late this morning.\n\nSo, I ask how does one get started? To just stop drinking. It sounds so easy and I can say I can stop today.  And can. I have bottles at my house that I dont open or feel the need to open. I need to stop looking for the social aspect and the bar scene and want to completely stop.  I can go a few days with nothing.... Then the itch to see people at the bar.... \n\nToday is the first day. Please help me get to day 10. Then 30 then 150 and so on.",

   "selftext": "Hi r/ADHD!\n\n(First off, I just found this sub today and read a lot of the posts. You guys seem so supportive, hardworking, and funny!)\n\nAfter not showing up/cancellations/failed uni courses/visits to a GP and apsychologist, I finally got to my appointment with my univeristy's psychiatric depmt yesterday. After an hour, the doctor gave me a self assessment for adhd. I scored 12. He said 4+ qualifies for looking more into it. After talking more about my childhood, life, habits, etc, he sent me to get started on the long process of getting an adult diagnosis evaluation. He said he suspects highly that I have ADHD-inattentive type. He gave me a prescription of ritalin for 1 week. Is this normal even though there is no official assessment? \n\n\n-----------\nSome (maybe) relevant facts/things about me (that got really out of hand and turned into a rant sorry, no need to read):\n\n1) abusive childhood. father with alcoholic+untreated Bipolar+untreated major depression+gambler+violence. He was highly intelligent and was formerly an astrophysicist and professor. Then unemployed then downward spiral toward violence then disowned me, now arrested in another country. He has a history of impulsivity (random vacations, car crashes, BIG spur financial decisions). I have anxious behaviours from my past. I am triggered by loud noises + anger. Males in power intimidate me and make me also want to please them while i seek affection and reassurance from women. I get into quasi-abusive/toxic friendships and relationships easily and overlook personal safety.\n\n2) I had straight A grades all my childhood. I was in the gifted program and had small classes, hands-on projects, and great teachers all my life. In grade 1, I read 1000 books for stickers from my teacher. I read 20 books a week for most of childhood. I got scholarships to uni, awards for writing. Now in my second year of university (engineering), I can't attend lectures without losing focus in 10 min/falling asleep/feeling trapped. I dont even get out of bed most days for class. I missed 4 exams this year, 20+ tests and failed with 1.34 gpa. But i try the same amount i did all my life, if not more. I try to study but end up spending 5 hours reading the same thing or sending emails or making to do lists or researching random things\n\n3) I lost my phone 3 times in 1 year, my water thermos 4 times, sometimes I cant remember appointments, pills or anything anyone says unless I write it down. \n\n4) I like new/fresh hobbies. I did bodybuilding for 1 year, kickboxing another year, last year i tried latin dance. I used to play violin and it was great sometimes. I got really into pottery one year. All very short lived passionate things that burned out.\n\n5) I interrupt people and want to talk all the time (or like here where even now I know Im typing too much)\n\n6) people sometimes describe me as: childish, energetic, manic, naive, too eager, \"random\", spazzy. My friends have a joke that I'm like agnes from despicable me. ITS SO FLUFFY IM GONNA DIEEEE hahahahaha lol\n\n7) I can't drag myself out of bed for no reason a lot of time. Not sad or anything. I just don't know what I need to do. Theres so many things but I cant get started\n\nI used to just think I'm just very excitable and I like to do a lot of things at once. Work 2 jobs and go to school and play sports and work out everyday at 7am! Fuck yeah! Challenge accepted. I wanted to be an astronaut or a army doctor or police officer or corporate manger. I chose electrical engineering because i want to build badass spaceships and nuclear power plants and robots. I can control myself usually. I can be professional and social and competent and normal and smart. But i feel stupid and lazy and incompetent all the time because I use subtitles for netflix even though i hear exactly what people say; i am childish and unfocused; i cant even keep my mouth shut sometimes. Couldnt I just be weird from some sort of ptsd anxiety from the abuse from my dad? Could i be bipolar like him??? Why does the doc look at me and immediately is like ye u need ritalin. The other psychologist said my program is just too hard for me and i cant handle. Someone else said i have ptsd. I never followed through long term with any treatment.\n\n--------------\n\n\n\nTLDR: 20 year old university student given 1 week of ritalin prescriptions despite only having a 1 assessment with a psychiatrist??? Is this ok??? How can i potentially have adhd and not know it??? Lots of random feelings and thoughts from sudden assessments and the prescription????? \n\n\nEdit: cut down some useless rambling",

Well paying job. Live with my parents. I have major substance abuse issues. I abused many substances all throughout college - but mostly was just a massive stoner and alcoholic. I've been cleanish for a couple years but had a major slip up back last summer. I got hooked on weed again and binged, getting high almost every day, all day, for a good 5 months. I also was closet drinking at a moderate alcoholic rate during this time. I knew I was ruining myself. So I decided to stop. Now I'm 5 months clean and dead inside.\n\nHere's the thing.. Video games are all I have. I have social anxiety and bad depression so I've pushed away most of my old friends. Don't really care, they were bad influences. I struggle making new connections. Even when I do force myself to go out and meet new people. I usually end up ghosting them. I've been single for 4 years now and have only been on 1 date.\n\nI'm so depressed. So dead inside. But video games seem to keep me going. I have friends online and have fun playing with them. I can forget about my problems for a few hours. I usually just work 9-5, get home and play Fortnite for the rest of the day. I've been doing this for about 6 months now and am starting to lose interest. \n\nI also have pretty bad OCD. I can get stuck in self destructive cycles where I just play \"one more\" for hours on end. But I have nothing else. Not sure where to turn to. Wherever I seem to get away from video games, I step back into substances.",

I also had a stomach infection at the same time, and since then I have never truly recovered \\- with low weight, constant fatigue and recurrent infections. Last year I had pneumonia for two months. After the stomach infection at 14, I was left with IBS and unable to digest gluten or soy. I am also vegetarian, but try to eat a lot of protein. \n\nI have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and borderline personality disorder. All are managed well, I see a therapist and I don't currently require medication. However, my physical symptoms often get put under the mental health umbrella when I seek advice, but I feel fine in myself \\(mental health\\-wise\\). I also have mitral valve prolapse, but have been told I don't need any treatment for this. \n\nAs for family history, my father died when I was 14 from alcoholism. He had epilepsy, ankylosing spondylitis and diabetes. My mother has had a heart attack, although is fine now. Family history of angina, diabetes, cancer and strokes. \n\nThis year has been tough, I have had viral tonsillitis for 6 weeks now, although my tonsils never really go down even when it subsides. I have been referred to see a specialist and hopefully get them removed. I have also had tender kidneys at times, and was tested for a kidney infection but that was negative. I suspect that was perhaps a reaction to the penicillin I was on. \n\nI suffer from chronic pain, predominantly in my back but when I exert myself I suffer for days after, with flu\\-like symptoms and muscle fatigue. I have recurring costochondritis.  I also have a number of sleep issues: sleep paralysis 2\\-3 times a week, night terrors, and most recently I have severe restless leg at night. It affects my foot, and has begun affecting my face. I have found massage helps, but I am still unable to sleep soundly. I get about 3\\-4 hours of unrestful sleep a night. I have regular dizzy spells, usually when I get up from a seated position and I faint 2 or so times a week. I also suffer from migraines 1\\-2 times a week.\n\nSo far, I have been tested for diabetes \\(with a urine test, clear. I also have a blood sugar monitor and this has yielded fairly normal results, albeit slightly low sometimes\\). I have had my iron levels checked, all normal. I take vitamin D supplements, multivitamins and iron and always have done.  I wore a 24 hour blood pressure monitor and was told this was fine. Although readings I have done myself have a resting pulse rate of 110 on average, and my diastolic pressure is sometimes well over 100. I had an ECG and was told this was fine. \n\nI have been prescribed Pregabalin \\(lyrica\\) to help with pain and restless leg, and have taken this before. It does make my pain disappear, however the side effects such as fatigue make work/university very difficult, and I am learning to drive so I don't wish to affect my concentration. I have spoken to my doctor about this and he is happy for me to resume when I am ready. \n\nAlthough my mental health is fine right now, it is deteriorating rapidly with the lack of sleep. I'm really just looking for some advice as to what I could ask my doctor next, or if there is anything obvious I am missing such as other deficiencies? I've run out of ideas!",

   "selftext": "Today marks 8 years since my father passed away.  His death is a complicated one, and I\u2019ve got two different stories depending on who I\u2019m speaking with.  With strangers and co-workers, it\u2019s \u201cHe died due to complications of esophageal cancer.\u201d  With friends, family, or other people I feel close to, I tell the whole story:\n\nMy dad was an alcoholic, one of those \u201chigh functioning\u201d alcoholics that only drank at night and due to his alcohol tolerance, could put down a lot of drink without looking or feeling hungover the next morning.  He would often drink to the point of passing out, eventually trudging off to bed in a drunken stupor.  Rinse and repeat the next day.\n\nHe was diagnosed with Stage 3 esophageal cancer in March 2008 during the spring break of my junior year in college.  I took care of him that summer during his numerous radiation and chemo appointments as my brother left for boot camp with the Navy and my mom was working 40-50 hours a week.  He was pretty despondent the entire time, and it was difficult staying positive.  Of course, he continued drinking and smoking, and resumed these activities not long after he had his esophagus removed toward the end of the summer. \n\nI went back to school and finished my senior year, leaving several months after for graduate school. I partially left to get away from the dark cloud that was my father.\n\nIn March 2010, I received a call from my brother saying my mom found my dad in his bedroom (my parents had separated September 2009 after I left for grad school) with second degree burns to his arm after having fallen asleep drunk with a cigarette.  He had done a similar thing in 2005, dropping a cigarette on the floor that caused a fire to start; our home was significantly damaged to the point it had to be completely gutted. \n\nWhile in the hospital for his burns, he suffered a stroke which left some permanent damage.  He eventually caught an infection and became septic. \n\nI had stayed in New Jersey where I was completing my Master\u2019s, too angry at my father to even speak with him.  Doctors determined his sepsis was irreversible, and I eventually received a phone call from my mom saying they were going to stop treatments and let him go.\n\nI went home a few days later.  I didn\u2019t want to go, but my then-boyfriend (now husband) said I should go, that it might help provide some closure.  Seeing him emaciated in bed, unable to recognize anyone around him or speak is an image I will never forget.\n\nIt took him over a week to die.  I wondered each day if we had made the right decision given how long it was taking for him to pass away.  I don\u2019t doubt now that it was the only thing we could do given how damaged his entire body was, but I struggle sometimes wondering if he was in any pain and was cognizant of anything.\n\nI post this because it\u2019s been 8 years today.  Each year, I never know how I\u2019m going to feel on the day.  Some years it\u2019s easy; I think about it for a little bit and that\u2019s that.  Other years, like this one, I struggle trying not to cry at work, feeling angry, guilty, sad, and frustrated for everything that happened.  Feeling like I wasted my time trying to keep him alive after his cancer diagnosis, angry that he didn\u2019t see me graduate, get married, and have a baby, sad he didn\u2019t feel the need to fight to stay around.\n\nMy husband doesn\u2019t understand my feelings, and I don\u2019t expect him to.  I know others have been through similar situations with their parents, and sometimes it\u2019s nice to unload in a place where others may \u201cget it.\u201d  I have a lot of unresolved issues with his death and the events leading up to it, issues I often don\u2019t know how to address.\n\nAnyway, even if only 1 other individual reads this, thanks; I needed to get this out.",

This is where our addiction can take us over. If these aren't kept in check then your guard is let down and you are more likely to start craving. Self Care and Service is the answer to these. Get some good sleep, put down the caffeine tablets, exercise, and eat well. For 30 minutes a day, try to help someone else. Whether picking up trash in your neighborhood, listening to someone else that needs to vent, commenting positive things on SD, or volunteering some other way, you will gain confidence and your spirit back.\n\n**RID** \\- **R**estless, Irritable, and Discontent. Do you ever wake up on the wrong side of the bed? Get rid of RID! Try to not do this with caffeine, rather exercise, meditation, or helping another alcoholic/problem\\-drinker. First thing in the morning!\n\n**PAWS** \\- **P**ost Acute Withdrawal Syndrome. By drinking all this time, you have altered your brain chemistry. You are going to go through a few months of feeling like crap, this is just detox! And because you feel like crap, you're gonna wanna drink. Just know that this is the process and once you recognize \\(become aware\\) and ACCEPT that this is detox, you can manage your cravings better and see it for what it is, just your brain trying to level off.\n\n**Replacement Techniques** \\- Identify your triggers for STRESS and write healthy replacements. Take a breath! Meditate! Go on a run! Write, make art, vent on SD. Choose a skill you want to learn and opt for self\\-improvement rather than self\\-detriment.\n\n**Spirit Guide** \\- You can call this God, Higher Power, The Universe, the Human Race, Love, Kindness, \\(mine looks like Pusheen\\) whatever you want. But what alcohol has done is take away your spirit and replaced *you* with its own. You can grab a spirit guide and a merit badge \\&gt;\\&gt; at any point in your journey and follow them to find yourself. I have like 250 spirit guides I've met through recovery. They preach kindness, love, self\\-discovery, selfcare, finding peace. Look around SD, there are tons of spirit guides here :\\) If you're lost at the moment, go ahead and reach out to any of the spirit guides and ask for directions :D\n\nHope you guys are doing well today!

I am a young woman who comes from an alcoholic home in a country that is rampant with this virus. It is almost comically normal to be a drunk here where I live. \n\nI have known for a while that my drinking pattern is dysfunctional, but have constantly hid behind excuses of unfulfilled needs. I have discovered psychology as my life's passion and art (and often a way to rationalize and excuse bad behavior) and have delved deep into myself to root out issues and dysfunctional patterns. I met the love of my life (a decade older than me) at a young age and have thus been able to discover and heal a lot of who I am. For a while now I have been standing in this doorway, too scared to truly do what I understand I must: to choose responsibility for my success and find my fulfillment in what I give, rather than being stuck running away from problems and demanding that what I need (in order to be this or that) come from somewhere outside of me. \n\nMy search has led me to acknowledge that not only was my father a drunk, the only other parent I had left, used me as a scapegoat and an emotional dumping ground. And now I see similar patterns emerging in my own marriage. I feel scared constantly. Sometimes I feel like I'm married to my abusive mother... \n\nI haven't had a drink in two days. We have been fighting. Today he mocked and humiliated my weakness, my acknowledged problem savagely and I felt even more broken and un-seen. I feel in shock and completely lost. And the only ray of light to go by now, is that whatever may come, If I want to rise to the challenges and opportunities the universe has presented me with, I must own my strength and honor it... With humbling gratitude, I see now that I have been given a gift- a way to become who I truly know I am. To find my strength in staying sober. I am present and in control. \n\nThank you! All of you here are a magnificent force! A community that comes together in vulnerability and finds true strength and grace! I am humbled to not drink with you today. And tomorrow. ",

I feel like because I have 5 misdemeanors now I will never achieve a single dream I had when I was younger, no matter how much I turn my life around I will never be forgiven at a job interview. \n\nI have c\\-ptsd from dealing with my moms addiction to heroin and finding her dead in the living room, which was the darkest most haunting moment of my entire life. The only thing I can think to cope with it sometimes is that I never have to experience it again. Luckily its less painful as time goes on but I don't even have a friend to talk to, hence the disjointed rambling, so I'm still probably slightly stuck in that year of my life. Times goes by and I just celebrated another birthday, I have no friends, all my family is dead, my relationship is toxic, I can barely leave bed most days, I hate the sun with a passion and how much is destroys my skin with freckles every inch of my body. I am just so miserable and the pain is constant. ",

   "selftext": "A few months ago I moved in with my sister as I couldn't handle living with my alcoholic father. I love him very much, but it was getting to be too much for me. I've dealt with depression and severe anxiety for years, but my sister helped me get a job (something I wasn't sure I'd ever be able to do)  and takes me to work nearly every day. We've always been really close and she's been incredibly supportive, and I've told her several times in the past how much I appreciate everything she does for me. My anxiety causes me to feel guilty about practically everything and I constantly feel like I'm a huge inconvenience to everyone. Today, out of the blue, she tells me that I have an attitude and  I'm rude and ungrateful and that I expect everyone to do everything for me and I'm honestly just shocked and have no idea where any of this came from and my feelings are really hurt and I don't know what to do. She does have borderline personality disorder and I don't know if that has anything to do with it but she pretty much just confirmed my fear that I'm a huge inconvenience. I'm really just hurt and confused. I've been trying so fucking hard, I hate my job but I continue to go and I've been more depressed and stressed out lately which apparently is coming off as \"attitude\" and is making her think that I don't like living here, which isn't the case, and I just don't know what to do. I don't have anywhere to go, I can't drive myself anywhere. I'm honestly just considering moving back in with my dad and I don't know what the point of this post is I just have nobody to talk to and I need to let it out somewhere. I really wish I could just kill myself because I don't think I'm ever gonna be a functional, independent adult but I'm too afraid to and I know how much it would destroy my parents. I don't know. This whole thing is really messing me up. ",

   "selftext": "People have started to joke about it. I'm in my late 20's and self-employed, tho I am not working since Xmas after watching a horrible family death (in a hospital no less). \n\nI used to wallow in my misery and cry myself. Now, I don't feel anything. The only way to feel a bit happy and relaxed is after a drink. I drink 21% stuff and can get through a litre a day/night. I don't FEEL addicted, I normally drink 3 days in a row and a few off.. no reason just don't feel like it. I drink the litre over a 10-12 hour period, sometimes I pour myself a glass at 10am.... because I want the buzz and a good start to my day. I always chug pints of water throughout the day though and don't experience any hangovers thanks to this. I never drive even after one drink, never blackout or get to vomiting stage. I don't do drugs or smoke. I just drink enough to be happy and when it wears off a bit I top up. Sober me is miserable, irritable, horrible, depressed... 1 drink \"me\" is happy and everyone wants to be around me.\n\nBut that's not me. Am I actually an alcoholic? Is my relationship based on the drunk me and not the real me? :(",

In fact this sub (which I didn\u2019t know about until this year) has been my only support resource - and what a fantastic one it is too! However I felt the need to be in the same room with other people who have similar problems. Don\u2019t want to dis AA ( saved/helped thousands of people etc) however, as before, I find it almost bureaucratic with all the rituals and observances. Towards the end of meeting we were asked if any newcomers wanted to share, I felt nothing I could say would add to the 45 minute series of shares id sat through about the benefits of AA \u2018service\u2019  - so said nowt. One other newcomer was clearly distressed, shared she wasn\u2019t sure if she was an alcoholic, as we left I referred her to this sub. For me this  sub works much better 24/7, tune into threads that resonate, tune out of those that don\u2019t. Still - would like to physically talk to someone- family, friends even wife think I\u2019m having a break - not outed myself yet. Scared to!",

Do you substitute with anything bad or good?\n\nFor myself I try really really hard to exercise and learn new things. But I know that when I drink, I can't stop and it weakens my willingness plus makes me horny AF. And I had many troubles with thad circle since... always pretty much.\n\nI'm really interested in your thoughts and experiences!",

   "selftext": "Okay, so I an eighteen-year-old female and let's just say I've had a rather unique life. I don't like to bitch and moan but I do need help, the trauma that I've death with abuse, homelessness, abandonment reckless alcoholism, death etc has to lead to me having a rather fucked mental state. I was diagnosed as having long-term depression starting from the age of five along with body dysmorphia anxiety insomnia and I now have suspected bipolar. what I need help with is, I have these \"voices\" if you will in my head telling me that I'm just moaning and that I'm just seeking attention and being weak and pathetic, and I'm trying to tell them to fuck off but it's rather difficult. I was just wondering if any of you have multiple diagnoses? how do you deal with it? I've been trying to get a doctor's appointment to discuss medication and treatment but I'm kind of scared I'll be leaving for university in september and I don't want to be treated badly or kicked off my course because of my mental health, I'm not in a bad way per say not like suicidal or anything but because of the label's and the stigma attached to it I'm scared. if any of you could give me tips on managing multiple disorders or to point out the fact I'm being a whiny bitch that needs to shut up and get on with it, I would be most appreciative, Sorry about how long winded it is.

Since I'm drinking a sh*tton of energy drinks since I'm 14 (yeah, my teeth are screwed) i thought that getting off sugar in the 1st place might be a better solution. I read it takes like one week to get rid of the addiction but how do I manage it the best and am I allowed to eat fruits in that time as long as i dont crave for soda and candy?\n\nBtw. I should mention that I consume around than a pound of pure sugar daily by my habits.",
